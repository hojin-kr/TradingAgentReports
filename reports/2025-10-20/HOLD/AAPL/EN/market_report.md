Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AAPL data and run the requested indicators, but I’m hitting a tool error (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data retrieval and indicator services. That means I can’t produce the exact, current numerical readings for AAPL right now. Here’s what I did and how we can move forward.

What happened
- Parallel calls to fetch data and multiple indicators failed with FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory. 
- I retried with a single get_YFin_data call, but the error persisted.
- Until the data tools are available again, I can’t present the live values or generate a live, data-driven trend report for AAPL.

What I can still provide right now
- A carefully chosen, complementary set of indicators to monitor for AAPL (max 8 indicators) that would give you a well-rounded view once data is accessible.
- A detailed methodology on how to interpret these indicators together, including concrete decision rules you could apply when the data is present.
- A structured report template and a Markdown table at the end to organize key takeaways.

Recommended indicator set for AAPL (8 indicators)
Rationale: These provide a blend of trend, momentum, and volatility insights with minimal redundancy. They are designed to confirm signals across different timeframes and to help you avoid false entries in mixed or choppy markets.

- close_50_sma
  Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps gauge if price is in a broader uptrend or downtrend.
- close_200_sma
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for filtering trades (e.g., only long signals when price is above both 50 and 200 SMAs, or watching for golden/death cross setups).
- close_10_ema
  Why: Short-term momentum shift detector. More responsive than the SMAs and useful for early entry/exit cues, especially around pullbacks or breakouts.
- macd
  Why: Core momentum measure based on EMA differences. Crossover and divergence signals help identify potential trend changes.
- macds
  Why: MACD signal line. Crossovers with MACD add confirmation and reduce false positives.
- macdh
  Why: Histogram (momentum magnitude). Helps visualize momentum strength and potential early divergences.
- rsi
  Why: Momentum with overbought/oversold context. Useful for spotting reversals or continuation in the presence of a trend.
- atr
  Why: Volatility gauge for risk management. Guides stop placement and position sizing by reflecting current price movement range.

How these indicators work together (high-level guidance)
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to establish the broader trend. Look for price to be above both for a bullish backdrop, or below both for bearish context.
- Momentum confirmation: Use macd/macds/macdh in conjunction with close_10_ema to confirm momentum and potential entry points. A MACD bullish crossover with rising MACD histogram supports long entries; a bearish crossover supports shorts or exits.
- Reversal guards: RSI helps detect overbought/oversold extremes that could precede a pullback, especially if momentum signals weaken or diverge from price.
- Risk management: ATR informs you about current volatility to adjust stops and position sizing; higher ATR typically implies wider stops and higher risk per trade.

What I will deliver once data access is restored
- The exact values, signals, and a data-driven trend assessment for AAPL as of 2025-10-20 (or the latest available date).
- An integrated interpretation: how the 8 indicators align or diverge, potential entry/exit points, and suggested risk controls.
- A concise decision framework you can apply in real time.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can keep retrying the data fetch in the background and report back as soon as the tools respond.
- Alternatively, if you have an alternative data source (CSV/raw data) you can share for AAPL, I can run the analysis against that data immediately.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, scenario-based analysis for AAPL using typical patterns and the 8 indicators as a framework, but please note it won’t reflect the exact current data until the data tools are back.

Appendix: Key insights framework (how to use the 8 indicators in practice)
- When price is above both the 50 SMA and 200 SMA, and MACD is bullish with a rising histogram, bias toward long entries, but confirm with RSI not showing extreme overbought levels.
- If MACD crosses below and the MACD histogram turns negative while price is near/above the 50 SMA, be cautious for a pullback; consider tightening stops using ATR.
- In high-volatility regimes (rising ATR), avoid tight stops; widen risk controls but keep overall exposure aligned with your risk budget.
- Use RSI as a sanity check: if RSI is overbought (e.g., >70) but price remains in uptrend with strong MACD momentum, wait for a pullback before entering.

Markdown table: key indicators, roles, signals, cautions, and usage examples
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  Role: Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  Signals to watch: Price above 50 SMA (bullish), price cross above/below 50 SMA
  Cautions: Lags price; use with faster signals to time entries
  Example usage: Enter long when price is above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA and pullbacks are contained by 50 SMA

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  Role: Long-term trend benchmark
  Signals to watch: Price above 200 SMA (bullish context), golden cross with 50 SMA
  Cautions: Very lagging; rely on corroboration from momentum indicators
  Example usage: Favor long setups in bullish context; avoid new shorts while price stays above 200 SMA

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  Role: Short-term momentum
  Signals to watch: Price above/below 10 EMA; cross with other indicators
  Cautions: Prone to noise; filter with longer-term trends
  Example usage: Use as a quick trigger on pullbacks in a confirmed uptrend

- Indicator: macd
  Role: Core momentum indicator
  Signals to watch: MACD line crossing zero or MACD cross with MACD signal
  Cautions: Crossovers can occur in range-bound markets; seek alignment with price action
  Example usage: Long entry when MACD crosses above its signal in uptrend context

- Indicator: macds
  Role: MACD signal line
  Signals to watch: MACD signal line crossing MACD, confirming momentum shift
  Cautions: Can lag MACD; require other filters
  Example usage: Enter on bullish MACD signal cross with rising histogram

- Indicator: macdh
  Role: Momentum strength
  Signals to watch: Histogram rising (positive momentum) or falling (waning momentum)
  Cautions: Can be volatile; use with MACD and RSI
  Example usage: Confirm strength when MACD bullish cross occurs

- Indicator: rsi
  Role: Momentum with overbought/oversold context
  Signals to watch: RSI crossing above/below thresholds (30/70), or divergence with price
  Cautions: In strong trends RSI can stay extended; look for corroboration from trend indicators
  Example usage: Take profit or avoid new longs if RSI is >70 in an uptrend and price looks exhausted

- Indicator: atr
  Role: Volatility gauge for risk management
  Signals to watch: Rising ATR suggests higher volatility; falling ATR suggests consolidation
  Cautions: Reactive measure; use for stop placement and position sizing
  Example usage: Increase stop distance with rising ATR; reduce position size if ATR spikes unexpectedly

If you’d like, I can retry the data pull now and, once successful, generate the full, data-driven report for AAPL with exact readings and an actionable set of signals.
