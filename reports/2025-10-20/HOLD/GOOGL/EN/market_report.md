Attempt to fetch data for GOOGL failed due to a data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError from the data source). I can retry the data pull and run the selected indicators as soon as the data service is available. In the meantime, here is a detailed, forward-looking plan and analysis framework using a carefully chosen set of indicators. Once the data is retrieved, I’ll provide a data-backed, nuanced read with exact values and signals.

Recommended indicator set (maximum 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_10_ema
  Why: Captures short-term momentum shifts and potential entry points. Quick to react, so it’s useful for early signals but prone to noise in choppy markets; pair with longer-term filters.
- close_50_sma
  Why: Mid-term trend reference and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify the prevailing trend and smoothing that can filter noisy entries from the 10-EMA.
- close_200_sma
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming the dominant market regime (bullish/bearish) and for golden/death cross context with other moving averages.
- macd
  Why: Core momentum measure showing differences between two EMAs; crosses and histogram shifts help identify trend changes and momentum strength in conjunction with the price trend.
- rsi
  Why: Momentum oscillator highlighting overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Also useful for spotting divergences against price trends.
- boll
  Why: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA) provides a dynamic baseline for price movement. Together with bands, helps identify breakouts versus mean-reversion setups and the current volatility regime.
- atr
  Why: True volatility measure to help with risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and to gauge the potential for price swings around the identified trend.
- vwma
  Why: Volume-weighted measure that confirms trends when price action aligns with volume. Helps discriminate with price-only indicators, reducing false signals in low-volume days.

Why these are suitable for GOOGL (as of a typical large-cap tech theme around 2025-10-20)
- Tech mega-caps often exhibit clear trend phases (driven by earnings, AI tailwinds, regulatory context). The mix above blends trend (50/200 SMA, VWMA), momentum (10-EMA, MACD, RSI), volatility context (ATR, Boll middle), and volume-confirmation (VWMA). This combination aims to minimize redundancy while providing a robust risk-aware framework.
- The MACD, RSI, and short/medium-term moving averages give timely signals without overfitting to a single indicator’s quirks.
- Boll middle and ATR offer complementary views on volatility and breakout vs. mean-reversion conditions, helping to discern legitimate breakouts from false moves.
- VWMA adds a volume dimension to validate price moves, which is particularly valuable for a stock like GOOGL where institutional activity can drive sizable moves.

How I’ll interpret the indicators once data is available
- Trend direction and strength: 200SMA vs price; 50SMA vs 200SMA crossovers; 10-EMA directional alignment with price and MAs.
- Momentum: MACD trend vs signal, RSI level and momentum (divergence potential) relative to the trend.
- Volatility and risk controls: ATR level for stop-loss sizing; Boll middle for context on whether price is trending away from the mean or oscillating within bands.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA alignment with price action to validate moves and reduce whipsaws.
- Synthesis rules ( provisional, will be updated with live data):
  - Bullish bias: Price above 50SMA and 200SMA with MACD positive and rising; RSI in a non-extreme zone (e.g., 40–70) and price trading above Boll middle; ATR showing moderate volatility; VWMA confirming upward price moves.
  - Bearish bias: Price below 50SMA/200SMA with MACD negative or diverging, RSI turning down from overbought, price testing or trading near/under Boll middle; ATR elevated (if accelerating volatility) and VWMA confirming selling pressure.
  - Neutral/sideways: Price near Boll middle, mixed MA signals, MACD flat, RSI not in extreme zones; use ATR for lower risk entries and tighter stops.

Next steps
- I will retry fetching the full data for GOOGL (2024-10-20 to 2025-10-20) and compute the eight indicators listed above.
- After successful retrieval, I’ll deliver:
  - A data-backed narrative detailing the latest values, crossovers/divergences, and scenario implications.
  - A concise, trader-ready set of actionable signals (entry/exit ideas, risk controls) aligned with the current regime.
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key findings and takeaways.

Please confirm if you’d like me to retry data retrieval now. If you prefer, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative read based on typical patterns for GOOGL in similar contexts and clearly label it as indicative pending live data. 

Key points to watch (table below)

- Indicator: close_10_ema | Role: Short-term momentum | Signal cues: cross above/below price; alignment with 50SMA for entry timing.
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Role: Mid-term trend filter | Signal cues: trend direction, potential support/resistance; cross with price.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Role: Long-term trend confirmation | Signal cues: golden/death cross context with 50SMA; regime indicator.
- Indicator: macd | Role: Momentum momentum signal | Signal cues: MACD line vs signal; zero-line crosses indicating trend changes.
- Indicator: rsi | Role: Momentum/overbought-oversold | Signal cues: extreme levels or divergences; confirm with trend.
- Indicator: boll | Role: Baseline volatility/mean-reversion context | Signal cues: price relative to middle line and bands for breakouts or reversals.
- Indicator: atr | Role: Volatility risk management | Signal cues: rising/falling volatility; adjust stops/position sizing accordingly.
- Indicator: vwma | Role: Volume-confirmed trend | Signal cues: price action aligned with rising/falling VWMA; strength of move.
