Thanks for the attempt. I’m hitting a backend error with the Reddit data tool right now (FileNotFoundError), so I can’t fetch Reddit sentiment data at the moment. I can still move forward in a few ways—your call:

Options
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data call again immediately if you’d like.
- Use other sources: I can compile sentiment and news from non-Reddit sources (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, major news outlets, company announcements) and then weave it into a cohesive analysis.
- Start with a skeleton: I can draft a complete long-form report outline and methodology now and fill in the Reddit portion once the tool is available again.

What I can deliver right away
- A robust framework for the long report (sections, data points to capture, and how I’ll interpret them for traders).
- A plan for the daily sentiment/volume tracking (past week) and the implications for GOOGL.
- A ready-to-fill Markdown table at the end with key points and signals.

If you’d like me to proceed with option 2 (non-Reddit sources) or option 1 (retry now), tell me which you prefer and I’ll proceed accordingly.

Proposed report structure (ready to fill with data)
- Executive snapshot: Overall sentiment trend, notable volatility, and quick take for traders.
- Day-by-day sentiment analysis (past 7 days): average sentiment score, volume of mentions, standout posts/themes for each day.
- Top drivers in social chatter: product/cohort themes (e.g., AI, Cloud, ads, regulatory/regulatory risk), influencer commentary, notable claims or rumors.
- Recent company news: recap of material headlines in the past week and their potential impact on sentiment and price action.
- Risk signals and catalysts: potential near-term catalysts (earnings cadence, regulatory developments, product launches) and risk factors that could shift sentiment.
- Practical implications for traders: trading ranges to watch, risk management notes, and scenario-based outcomes (bullish/bearish/neutral).
- Data appendix: sources, methodology, and any caveats.

Sample Markdown table (structure only)
| Source | Timeframe | Sentiment (avg) | Mention Volume | Key Signals / Themes | Potential Trading Implication |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Reddit (pending) | Past 7 days | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Twitter/X (pending) | Past 7 days | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| News (pending) | Past 7 days | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Overall | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry Reddit data now
- Use alternative sources only
- Start with skeleton now and fill later

Once you pick, I’ll produce the full report in the chosen format and include the Markdown table with the key points.
