Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch Reddit sentiment data for QQQ on 2025-10-20, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). I can retry, or we can proceed with an alternative plan to keep the analysis moving. Here are two options and a proposed path forward:

Options
1) Retry now: I can try the Reddit data fetch again immediately and then proceed with the full, trader-focused report once I have the data.
2) Alternate plan: I can proceed with a structured, methodology-focused report using available signals from other sources (e.g., recent news themes, macro sentiment indicators, ETF-specific drivers) and clearly label data gaps due to the Reddit fetch issue. Then, when the Reddit data becomes available, I can add the sentiment layer and update the report.

What I propose to deliver (regardless of the path chosen)
- A comprehensive, trader-focused report analyzing QQQ (the Nasdaq-100 ETF) over the past week, combining:
  - Reddit/social sentiment signals (when available)
  - Recent ETF-related news and macro context
  - Thematic drivers (AI/tech momentum, rate expectations, semiconductor trends, large-cap leadership)
  - Daily sentiment trends and notable theme shifts
  - Implications for trading decisions (short-term setup, risk considerations, and scenarios)
- A clear set of actionable takeaways for traders and investors
- A Markdown summary table at the end organizing key points, themes, and signals

Preliminary report framework (without Reddit data filled yet)
- Executive snapshot
  - What the last week’s sentiment and news imply for QQQ’s near-term trajectory
  - Key risk and catalysts to watch
- Sentiment analysis (reddit-focused, pending data)
  - Daily sentiment levels, notable spikes, and dominant themes (buy-the-dip, AI/tech optimism, market fears)
  - Subreddits and post-types driving momentum (e.g., r/investing, r/StockMarket, r/QQQ if applicable)
  - Correlation with price action and volume
- News flow and macro context
  - Major ETF-level news (rebalancing, index methodology updates if any, fund flows)
  - Tech/AI sector news influencing Nasdaq-100 components
  - Macro backdrop (rates expectations, inflation data, macro risk sentiment)
- Thematic drivers observed
  - AI/capital expenditure cycles, semis, cloud software, consumer tech externalities
  - Sector leadership shifts within QQQ’s holdings
- Price action and technical read
  - Short-term patterns (range, breakout/bounce cues, moving averages)
  - Volume anomalies and price-Volume divergence cues
- Trader implications and scenarios
  - Bullish tilt: where to look for confirmation (breakouts, leadership among top holdings)
  - Bearish tilt: risk checks (momentum fade, negative macro surprises)
  - Neutral/transition: consolidation signals and risk management
- Risks and caveats
  - Data gaps due to sentiment data availability
  - ETF-specific considerations (tracking error, flows)
- Key data table (to be populated with Reddit data and news signals)

If you’d like me to proceed now with a retry, I’ll run the Reddit data fetch for QQQ again and then generate the full, detailed report with the latest sentiment signals included. If you prefer the alternate plan, I’ll pull together a robust, data-grounded analysis using non-Reddit sources first and clearly mark gaps to be filled once the Reddit feed comes back online.

Please tell me which option you want, and I’ll proceed accordingly.

Note: I’ll append a Markdown table at the end of the final report to organize key points, as requested. Here is a placeholder template you’ll see filled in once data is available:

- Placeholder Markdown table (to be filled post-data collection)
| Date | Source | Sentiment (net) | Top Themes | Notable Posts/Signals | Price Action Context | Trade Implications |
|------|--------|-----------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or switch to the alternate plan and start with the non-Reddit data?
