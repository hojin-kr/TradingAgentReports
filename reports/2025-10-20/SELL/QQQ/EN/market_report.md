I’m running into a tool issue: the data retrieval calls for QQQ are currently failing with a FileNotFoundError on the backend. I tried fetching both price data and the indicator reports, but the system isn’t returning results right now. If you’d like, I can retry in a few minutes or try a different date range, but I don’t have reliable data at the moment to compute and display actual indicator values.

In the meantime, here is a careful plan for analyzing QQQ once data is available, along with the up-to-8-indicator selection I would use to get complementary, non-redundant insights. I’ve chosen indicators that cover trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context.

Selected indicators (8) and rationale
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  - What it tells you: medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to read: price above 50SMA suggests a bullish tilt; price below suggests a bearish tilt. Crosses can precede trend shifts when used with other signals.

- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  - What it tells you: long-term trend context and major support/resistance benchmark.
  - How to read: price above 200SMA indicates a long-term uptrend; price below indicates a long-term downtrend. Golden/death-cross dynamics with the 50SMA add extra confirmation when data align.

- macd: MACD line
  - What it tells you: momentum and trend strength, with potential changes in direction.
  - How to read: MACD line crossing above the signal line is a potential bullish signal; crossing below is a potential bearish signal. Divergences with price add confidence (requires confirmation with other indicators).

- macds: MACD Signal
  - What it tells you: smoothing of MACD, helps confirm MACD cross signals.
  - How to read: MACD crossing the MACD signal line (from below or above) reinforces a buy/sell signal when aligned with price action and other indicators.

- rsi: RSI
  - What it tells you: momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to read: RSI near or above 70 can indicate overbought conditions in an uptrend (watch for reversals/divergences); RSI near or below 30 can indicate oversold conditions in a downtrend (watch for reversals). In strong uptrends, RSI can stay extended, so cross-check with trend indicators.

- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band
  - What it tells you: breakout/overbought pressures and potential pullbacks near a resistance zone.
  - How to read: price pushing the upper band can signal strong bullish volatility or potential overextension; a pullback from the band may present a short-term reversal cue if confirmed by other signals.

- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band
  - What it tells you: downside support zones and potential oversold pressure.
  - This helps identify credible reversal baselines in oversold conditions or breakouts when price rallies away from the band.

- vwma: VWMA (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
  - What it tells you: price action in the context of traded volume.
  - How to read: price moving above VWMA with rising volume supports a stronger, volume-backed uptrend; a cross below VWMA with weakening volume can indicate waning impulse.

Why these are suitable for QQQ (contextual notes)
- QQQ is tech-heavy and tends to exhibit pronounced momentum and volatility. The chosen indicators provide:
  - Trend confirmation across multiple timeframes (50SMA and 200SMA) to distinguish medium vs. long-term direction.
  - Momentum confirmation (MACD, MACD Signal, RSI) to time entries with fewer false signals when used together.
  - Volatility and breakout context (Bollinger bands) to spot potential breakouts or pullbacks in a high-volatility environment.
  - Volume-backed price action (VWMA) to filter signals by whether moves are supported by participation, which is especially valuable for tech ETFs that can show spike-driven moves.

What I will do once data is available
- Compute the eight indicators for QQQ over the requested window.
- Generate a synthesis report that:
  - Compares current readings relative to key levels (e.g., price vs SMA, RSI thresholds, MACD cross status, Boll bands proximity).
  - Checks for confluence across indicators (e.g., price above 50SMA and MACD bullish cross with RSI not in extreme overbought territory).
  - Highlights potential entry/exit zones and risk considerations (e.g., ATR-like volatility context if we later add it as a supplemental view).
- Provide a concise set of actionable takeaways (e.g., trend determination, momentum signals, and risk-aware entry/exit points) plus a structured table of the indicators and interpretations.

Proposed report format (for when data is back)
- A detailed narrative describing the current trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context for QQQ.
- A section-by-section interpretation of each of the 8 indicators.
- A conflict-resolution section: what to do when indicators disagree (e.g., rely on higher-timeframe trend vs. momentum signals).
- Practical trade ideas (entry, stop, target) aligned with the signals.

Markdown table (key points)
Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret in QQQ context | How to act (basic guidelines)
- close_50_sma | 50-day trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above = bullish medium-term trend; price below = bearish | Use with MACD/RSI for entries; watch for crossovers near the 50SMA
- close_200_sma | 200-day long-term trend | Price above = long-term uptrend; price below = long-term downtrend | Consider trend-confirmed entries when aligned with other momentum signals
- macd | Momentum/trend strength | Bullish when MACD line crosses above MACD signal; bearish on cross below | Confirm with RSI and price action; avoid noisy crossovers in choppy markets
- macds | MACD signal line | Reinforces MACD cross signals | Use as a secondary confirmation
- rsi | Momentum magnitude, overbought/oversold | >70 suggests overbought in uptrends; <30 suggests oversold in downtrends; watch for divergences | Look for reversals only when supported by trend and price action
- boll_ub | Upper Bollinger Band | Price near/above band can indicate overextension or strong breakout | Confirm with MACD/RSI and price pattern before acting
- boll_lb | Lower Bollinger Band | Price near/below band can indicate oversold or mean-reversion potential | Confirm with volume and price action
- vwma | Volume-adjusted price trend | Price above VWMA with rising volume supports a stronger uptrend; cross below with weak volume weakens trend | Use as a trend/filter and to validate breakout signals

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now to generate the actual numeric indicator readings and the full, data-driven report.
- Alternatively, if you prefer, I can proceed with this qualitative framework and a placeholder report, and replace placeholders with real values as soon as data access is restored.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or proceed with the qualitative framework and wait for the data tool to come back online?
