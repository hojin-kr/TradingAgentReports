I attempted to fetch META data and the requested indicators, but the data retrieval environment returned a FileNotFoundError for the Yahoo Finance data and the stock stats indicators. Because I can’t access the actual numeric data right now, I’ll proceed with a detailed, structured analysis based on the chosen indicators and how they would typically be interpreted for META in a mid-term/trend-following setup. When the data access is restored, I can plug in the exact values and give precise signal timings.

Selected indicators (up to 8) and why they’re suitable
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Rationale for this combination
- Trend confirmation and dynamic support/resistance:
  - close_50_sma: Medium-term trend gauge; helps identify current trend direction and dynamic support/resistance levels.
  - close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; a primary filter for the market’s health; useful for recognizing golden/death-cross setups when combined with the 50 SMA.
  - close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum signal; complements the longer SMAs by signaling quicker shifts in price action.
- Momentum signals and cross-confirmation:
  - macd, macds, macdh: The MACD trio provides momentum direction (MACD line), timing (MACD signal), and strength/momentum changes (MACD histogram). Together they help filter false signals in choppy markets and complement the SMA-based trend view.
- Momentum/overbought–oversold context:
  - rsi: Momentum gauge with standard 70/30 thresholds; can signal potential reversals or warning of trend exhaustion when price is extended.
- Volatility/risk management:
  - atr: Measures current volatility to inform stop placement and position sizing; helps adapt risk to changing market conditions.

How these indicators would interpret META in a typical look-back window (once data is available)
- Trend perspective:
  - If META is trading above both the 50 SMA and 200 SMA, and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA (golden cross condition), the default stance would be bullish: look for pullbacks to the 50 SMA as potential entry points, with trend confirmation from MACD lines/Hist and RSI not diverging unfavorably.
  - If META is below both SMAs or the 50 SMA is below the 200 SMA (death cross risk), the stance shifts toward caution or a potential short-side bias; use MACD momentum signals and RSI conditions to gauge potential reversals or continuation patterns.
- Momentum and entry timing:
  - MACD cross above its signal line (MACD bullish crossover) with MACD histogram turning positive strengthens the case for a bullish entry, especially if price is above the 50/200 SMAs.
  - A MACD cross below its signal line with histogram turning negative reinforces a bearish bias, particularly if accompanied by price trading near or below SMAs.
  - RSI provides context on momentum extremes: RSI rising toward or above 70 supports continued upside in a solid uptrend, but rising into the overbought zone should prompt caution and tighter risk controls; RSI dropping toward/below 30 could signal a potential reversal in a downtrend or during a sideways grind.
- Volatility and risk control:
  - ATR rising indicates increasing volatility, suggesting wider stop distances and possibly trailing stops to avoid premature exit in a trending environment; ATR subdued implies lower risk of whipsaws and tighter stops can be used.
- Entry/exit scaffolding:
  - A bullish setup would look for: price trading above 50/200 SMAs, MACD bullish crossover, positive MACD histogram, RSI not diverging negatively or rising toward overbought without a strong price breakout, and ATR providing a sensible stop distance.
  - A bearish setup would look for: price trading below SMAs, MACD bearish crossover, negative histogram, RSI turning down (potentially breaking below 50 or 30 region depending on context), and ATR indicating rising volatility that may accompany a move.

Trading strategy implications (high-level, given we don’t have numeric data yet)
- Trend-following tilt with risk-aware entries:
  - Primary assumption: price action remains above 50 and 200 SMAs with occasional pullbacks to the 50 SMA as potential entries.
  - Use MACD crossovers to time entries on pullbacks during an uptrend; confirm with RSI not displaying strong overbought signals that would imply immediate pullback risk.
- Risk management:
  - Use ATR to set dynamic stop-loss distances; in higher volatility regimes (ATR rising), widen stops accordingly to reduce whipsaw risk, but maintain a defined risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of account equity per trade depending on risk tolerance).
- Scenario considerations:
  - Bullish scenario: price above SMAs, MACD bullish cross, MACD histogram positive, RSI not overextended, ATR rising but price continuing to push higher in a controlled fashion.
  - Neutral/uncertain scenario: price around SMAs with MACD flat, RSI around midlines (40-60), ATR decreases or remains low; prefer waiting for a clearer breakout or pattern confirmation.
  - Bearish scenario: price below SMAs, MACD bears cross, MACD histogram negative, RSI trending lower, ATR elevated suggesting breakout risk to the downside; implement cautious short-side approach or stay on the sidelines if confirmation is weak.

Important caveats
- I don’t have the actual META data in this session due to a data retrieval error. The interpretations above are conditional on typical relationships between these indicators. Once data access is restored, I will compute exact indicator values and provide precise signals, dates, and price levels.
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now or on a specific date range (e.g., last 6–12 weeks) to generate precise readings and a signal table.

Proposed next steps
- Retry data fetch for META with the same date range or a shorter range to ensure stability.
- If successful, I’ll produce:
  - An in-depth, data-driven trend and signal report using the 8 indicators chosen.
  - Timely entry/exit suggestions aligned with the current readings.
  - A summary table of key observations.

Appendix: quick reference on how to read each indicator (when you review the outputs)
- close_50_sma: Uptrend when price is above and the 50 SMA is rising; potential support around the 50 SMA.
- close_200_sma: downtrend or risk-off bias when price is below; long-term trend alignment when price is above.
- close_10_ema: Early momentum shifts; look for crossovers with price or SMAs as entry cues.
- macd: Momentum direction; bullish cross (MACD above signal) strengthens up moves; bearish cross weakens them.
- macds: Smoother signal; cross with MACD line provides confirmation timing cues.
- macdh: Momentum strength; positive histogram supports ongoing up moves; negative histogram supports down moves.
- rsi: Overbought/oversold contexts; look for divergences and crossovers relative to trend.
- atr: Volatility gauge; higher ATR means wider price swings and larger stop distances; lower ATR means tighter risk controls.

Table (ready to populate after data is available):
| Indicator | Role | What to look for | Trade setup what's favorable | Risk note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Trend/Support | Price above rising 50 SMA; pullback to 50 SMA as potential entry | Long on pullbacks in uptrend when other signals align | 50SMA lagging; use with other signals for timing |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Price above vs below 200 SMA for trend bias | Bulls favor long positions if price above and golden cross tendencies | Important macro filter; false positives possible in choppy markets |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | 10 EMA crosses price or 50 SMA; quick momentum shift | Use for early entries on trend continuation | Noise in choppy markets; filter with longer-term trend |
| macd | Momentum direction | MACD line vs Signal line; histogram | Bullish cross with rising histogram; bearish cross with falling histogram | Use with price action and RSI|
| macds | Confirmation timing | MACD Signal line behavior | Cross above/below with MACD for entry/exit timing | Lagging but helpful for confirmation |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram shows widening/narrowing | Positive widening supports sustained moves; negative widening signals reversals | Can be volatile; confirm with other indicators |
| rsi | Momentum overbought/oversold | RSI >70 overbought; <30 oversold; divergence signals | Buy signals in uptrends when RSI cools from overbought; sells in downtrends when RSI spikes lower | In strong trends RSI can stay extended |
| atr | Volatility risk | Rising ATR = bigger price moves; falling ATR = consolidation | Adjust stops and position size; wider stops in high volatility | Reactive measure; combine with price action |
