Recommendation
- Buy META with an overweight allocation, targeting a 12–24 month horizon. Implement in stages, with disciplined risk controls and clear milestone-driven add-ons.

Rationale (why this fits the plan)
- AI-driven monetization edge: META’s AI compute moat supports lower marginal costs per impression and improved ad targeting, which should lift ARPU over time.
- Cross-app monetization network: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and emerging formats (Shop in Feed, AI-assisted creatives) offer multi-touch revenue expansion and data-network advantages.
- Strong cash flow and capital discipline: Free cash flow supports buybacks and balance-sheet resilience, creating downside protection and potential multiple expansion as ROI milestones materialize.
- Optionality with AR/VR and creator/ecommerce: The plan leverages optionality without relying on immediate Metaverse profitability.

Key catalysts and monitoring (data-driven focus)
- Data-center ROI milestones: utilization, cost per compute unit, margin impact, and ROI timeline.
- AI-enabled monetization uptake: incremental ARPU, adoption of AI formats, creator/ecommerce monetization.
- Ad market health: demand trends, pricing power, and guidance on ad-revenue trajectory.
- Regulatory developments: data usage/targeting rules and privacy compliance impact.
- Buyback and capital returns: progress and impact on per-share value.

Strategic actions (concrete steps)
- Positioning and sizing
  - Start with a core overweight position now, then scale into the position via staged add-ons on validated pullbacks or upon confirmation of AI ROI milestones.
- Entry and scaling plan
  - Initial core tranche now; add on shallow pullbacks (e.g., 3–7% from recent highs) or on corroborated milestones (ROI improvements, ARPU uplift).
- Risk controls and hedges
  - Employ ATR-based trailing stops to protect downside (adjust to personal risk tolerance and volatility).
  - Consider hedges (long puts 6–12 months out or a collar) to limit downside during macro/regulatory shocks or earnings surprises.
  - Set a maximum drawdown cap for the META sleeve to prevent excessive risk concentration.
- Monitoring routine
  - Maintain a concise dashboard: price action indicators (SMA/EMA, MACD, RSI, ATR) + operational metrics (data-center utilization, ARPU progression, ad-demand trends, format uptake).
  - Schedule quarterly reviews to reassess ROI milestones, ad-demand stability, and regulatory developments.
- Decision rules and scenarios
  - Base case: ROI milestones achieved, ad demand stabilizes, monetization accelerates, leading to earnings resilience and multiple expansion.
  - Bear case: ROI timing slips or ad demand weakens; prune exposure or adjust hedges.
  - Bull case: ROI milestones surprise to the upside; stronger ARPU uplift and faster monetization drive outsized upside.

What success looks like (12–24 months)
- AI ROI milestones met with measurable ARPU uplift and monetization expansion across the ecosystem.
- Strong FCF supports continued buybacks; valuation multiple expands relative to current levels, with resilient downside due to cash generation.

If you want, I can tailor this to a tighter horizon (intraday, 1–4 weeks, 1–3 months, 6–12 months) and attach explicit scenario-based price targets once we have live signals (SMA/EMA/MACD/RSI/ATR) and updated guidance. I can also provide a compact signal table and a precise entry/exit roadmap aligned with your risk preferences (max drawdown, ATR-based stop distance, position-size caps).
