Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch META Reddit data for 2025-10-20, but the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t pull that specific dataset right now. I can still deliver a thorough weekly analysis using other sources and provide a solid framework for traders. If you want, I can retry the Reddit fetch once the tool issue is resolved. Here’s a comprehensive interim report you can use now.

Executive snapshot
- META remains a AI-forward platform with a core focus on advertising, social apps (Facebook, Instagram, Threads), and strategic bets in AI infrastructure and the metaverse/XR space.
- The weekly sentiment is likely shaped by: updates on AI product integration and monetization, ad demand trends, regulatory risk (privacy and antitrust scrutiny), results from any product launches or earnings commentary, and capital allocation signals (buybacks/capital returns).
- Near-term catalysts to watch: any earnings/quarterly updates, product announcements (AI features, ad products, creator tools), regulatory developments in the U.S./EU, and updates on user engagement/ad performance for key apps.

Key sentiment drivers and what they imply for traders
1) AI product monetization and integration
- What to look for: announcements around monetizing AI features (e.g., ad-targeting improvements, commerce integrations, AI-assisted creator tools) and any traction metrics (revenue lift, ARPU, engagement).
- Trader takeaway: Positive signals (clear monetization, improving ARPU, sustainability) could support multiple expansion; weak or delayed monetization could keep the stock in a cautious stance, especially if macro ad demand remains soft.

2) Advertising demand trends
- What to look for: commentary on ad market conditions, pricing power, and spend by large brands. Signals of stabilization or acceleration in ad revenue would be constructive; signs of continued weakness could pressure near-term multiples.
- Trader takeaway: META often trades on ad demand sentiment. A stabilizing or improving ad market with cost discipline can be a favorable setup; persistent macro softness could cap upside.

3) Regulation and policy risk
- What to look for: updates on privacy rules, data usage, antitrust scrutiny, or compliance costs. Any regulatory headwinds typically weigh on sentiment.
- Trader takeaway: Regulatory risk can cap upside in the near term. If META demonstrates proactive compliance measures or regulatory clarity, sentiment could improve.

4) Metaverse/Reality Labs progress
- What to look for: progress on XR hardware/software, developer ecosystems, or user engagement in VR/AR products; clear path to profitability or a defined cost discipline.
- Trader takeaway: The metaverse remains a long-term optionality. Near-term progress that reduces burn or shows early monetization could support sentiment; persistent high burn without clear path to profitability might pressure valuations.

5) Threads, social features, and user engagement
- What to look for: growth and engagement metrics, monetization signals for Threads, cross-platform integration, and user retention.
- Trader takeaway: Positive engagement growth and solid monetization signals could buoy sentiment, particularly if competing platforms show slower progress.

6) Capital allocation (buybacks/dividends)
- What to look for: any updates on share repurchase programs, dividends, or debt reduction.
- Trader takeaway: Buybacks can support a constructive price backdrop, especially in a stock with a large cash balance and a management team signaling confidence.

Macro and company-context considerations
- Competitive landscape: AI-enabled ad platforms and social apps are under pressure from both incumbents and newcomers. META’s advantage is scale and data network effects, but execution in AI monetization and creator tools will be critical.
- Profitability focus: Look for evidence of operating leverage as AI investments mature and as ad demand patterns evolve. Any guidance on cost discipline and expense mix (CAC, R&D, and marketing) will matter for margins.
- Global regulatory environment: Expect continued emphasis on data privacy and antitrust scrutiny. Company commentary on regulatory risk and compliance investments will influence sentiment.

Trading implications and potential strategies
- Base case thesis: The stock trends with ad demand and AI monetization progress. If the company demonstrates meaningful progress on AI monetization while maintaining cost discipline, the stock could re-rate higher on a longer-term horizon.
- Short-term/trade ideas:
  - If indicators point to stabilizing ad demand and early AI monetization signals, consider cautious long exposure or a buy-the-dip approach around minor pullbacks.
  - If regulatory headlines worsen or the AI monetization path appears delayed, consider hedged positions or reducing exposure and waiting for clearer catalysts.
  - Watch for buyback announcements or capital returns that can act as a near-term tailwind, especially in a broad market risk-off environment.
- Risk management:
  - Keep an eye on macro fan-out effects (digital ad spend sensitivity to macro conditions).
  - Be aware of potential volatility around earnings events or regulatory news.
  - Use stop-loss levels aligned with your risk tolerance, given that sentiment can swing on single data points.

What I can deliver next (once the data tool is available)
- A day-by-day sentiment breakdown for META across social media and news channels over the past week.
- A summarized sentiment score, with positive/neutral/negative deltas per day.
- A more granular table of key headlines, their perceived sentiment impact, and potential price implications.
- A final Markdown table consolidating themes, data points, and trading implications.

Appendix: provisional Markdown table of key themes and takeaways
- Note: This table reflects anticipated themes for META based on ongoing AI/ads strategy and macro/regulatory context as of 2025-10-20. It will be updated with day-by-day sentiment data once Reddit data retrieval succeeds.

| Theme | Sentiment signal (provisional) | Key catalysts this week | Potential implications for META stock | Trader takeaway |
|-------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| AI monetization progress | Mixed to slightly positive if monetization signals emerge | AI feature launches, ads monetization metrics | Positive if revenue lift is clear; negative if delays persist | Look for concrete monetization metrics and path to profitability from AI investments |
| Ad demand trends | Cautious to neutral; macro softness could weigh | Q/Q ad revenue trends, guidance updates | If ad demand stabilizes, sentiment improves; prolonged softness could cap upside | Monitor quarterly updates and guidance for ad spend recovery timing |
| Regulation and policy risk | Cautious/negative backdrop anticipated | Privacy/regulatory developments, compliance updates | Negative sentiment risk if headlines escalate; positive if META demonstrates proactive risk management | Track regulatory news and company compliance investments |
| Metaverse/Reality Labs progress | Neutral to cautious; long-term optionality | XR hardware/software updates, burn rate, developer metrics | Near-term impact modest; longer-term potential if monetization path is clearer | Separate near-term profitability from longer-term strategic bets |
| Threads and social product updates | Slightly positive if user growth and monetization pick up | User metrics, monetization features, cross-platform integration | Positive if Threads drives engagement and revenue; negative if growth stalls | Watch user/engagement metrics and monetization indicators |
| Capital allocation (buybacks) | Positive if announced or increased | Buyback announcements, dividend updates | Can provide short-term price support; limited impact if overall growth concerns persist | Favor stocks with clear capital return signals when sentiment is uncertain |

If you want me to proceed with a deeper qualitative narrative now (without the Reddit data) or to retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available again, tell me which approach you prefer. I can also tailor the report to emphasize certain aspects (e.g., more weight on regulatory risk, or more emphasis on AI monetization signals) as you prefer.
