Decision: Buy (with disciplined risk management)

Rationale
- Durable growth engine: Palantir’s Foundry plus the AI/Data Cloud trajectory, especially with Snowflake integration, supports cross-sell expansion and deeper enterprise adoption across Gov and Commercial. This aligns with a multi-year growth runway and improving retention.
- Moat with scale: Government contracts provide revenue visibility and resilience; governance, security, and auditability are meaningful differentiators that can drive higher ARR per customer and stickiness as deployments expand.
- Margin leverage on scale: As usage grows and onboarding accelerates (more seats, modules, integrations), operating leverage should improve, supporting a favorable risk/reward given a credible path to margin expansion.
- Manageable near-term risks: Valuation premium is acknowledged, but the combination of diversified mix and multiple catalysts reduces single-point risk. Key concerns (policy exposure, competition, headlines) are manageable with a structured plan and hedging.

Actionable plan (starter framework)
1) Positioning and entry
- Core stance: Establish a core long position now, with a tiered add-on strategy on meaningful pullbacks or upon clear milestones (Foundry + AIP deployments, major gov/commercial wins, or reinforcing cross-sell momentum with Snowflake).
- If already long, use the plan’s cadence to add on pullbacks or milestone-driven strength.

2) Risk controls and hedging
- Stops: Implement a trailing stop or ATR-based stop to shield against volatility around catalysts or regulatory headlines.
- Optional hedges: Consider a protective put or collar around near-term catalysts to cap downside while preserving upside.
- Position cap: Keep exposure within a prudent slice of risk capital (e.g., 5–12% of the growth-tech sleeve, adjusted for volatility and conviction).

3) Catalysts and monitoring
- Key catalysts to watch: Snowflake integration milestones, Foundry + AIP deployment progress, enterprise ARR growth, net retention trends, and Gov/Commercial mix shifts.
- Monitoring metrics: ARR growth, gross/net margins, customer expansion (seat growth, cross-sell), renewal rates, and any governance/regulatory headlines.

4) Exit strategy and scenarios
- Base case: Sustainable ARR growth with improving margins; progressively harvest gains on strength or milestone-driven rallies.
- Bear-case guardrails: If growth decelerates meaningfully or headlines/Gov risk spike without resolution, reduce exposure and tighten hedges.
- Clear targets: Predefine price or risk-adjusted return targets to trigger reevaluation or partial realization of gains.

5) Operational cadence
- Quarterly reviews: ARR growth, retention, mix, and margin trajectory.
- Mid-cycle checks: Milestones for Foundry + AIP and Snowflake collaboration; watch for co-sell dynamics and incentive alignment.
- Risk events: Predefine hedging or exit responses for regulatory or headline-driven events.

6) Tailoring to your situation (request-based)
- If you share your current PLTR position, time horizon, and max tolerated loss, I’ll tailor entry points, add-on rules, hedging levels, and exact exit targets to match your capital, risk tolerance, and objective.

Would you like me to tailor this to your exact position size, holding period, and risk ceiling? If you provide your current PLTR position (shares or dollar value), target holding period, and maximum acceptable loss, I’ll refine entry points, hedges, and exit targets accordingly.
