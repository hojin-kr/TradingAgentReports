I attempted to fetch PLTR data (PLTR) for 2024-10-01 to 2025-10-20 using the data tool, but it returned a FileNotFoundError from get_YFin_data. I can retry or adjust the data source/date range, but I don’t have a successful data feed right now to generate a live trend analysis. In the meantime, here is a robust, complementary indicator setup tailored for PLTR (Palantir Technologies) and why each piece is useful. Once the data fetch succeeds, I’ll generate a detailed, data-driven trend report and signal read.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Identifies the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. A rising 50 SMA suggests a constructive mid-term trend; a drop below can signal a change in tone.
  - Why for PLTR: PLTR often exhibits multi-quarter cycles with aren’t always clean, so a mid-term trend filter helps reduce noise and aligns entries with the prevailing drift.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and confirmation; watch for golden cross (50/200) or death cross signals for strategic context.
  - Why for PLTR: Provides a broader context for whether pullbacks are healthy (pullbacks in a bullish regime) or part of a larger downtrend.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum gauge; helps identify quick shifts in momentum and potential entries.
  - Why for PLTR: Helps detect early pullbacks or advances in a volatile tech name where shorter-term momentum can precede longer-term trend shifts.

- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: Core momentum signal; crossovers of MACD line with signal line indicate potential trend changes; divergence can signal weakening/strengthening momentum.
  - Why for PLTR: Provides a momentum perspective during earnings/innovation cycles when price reacts to news-driven moves.

- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: MACD Signal line; crossovers with MACD for trade triggers; smoother interpretation of MACD momentum signals.
  - Why for PLTR: Helps filter noise in a high-volatility name by confirming MACD-derived signals.

- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: MACD Histogram; visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences; helps gauge the velocity of momentum changes.
  - Why for PLTR: Divergence with price can precede trend reversals, especially around key catalysts or market corrections.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Purpose: Momentum and overbought/oversold gauge; 70/30 thresholds; watch for divergences to anticipate reversals.
  - Why for PLTR: In a volatile growth stock, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods during upswings; use with trend context to avoid false reversals.

- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Purpose: Measures volatility to help set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizing; helps manage risk in a volatile name.
  - Why for PLTR: PLTR tends to have episodic volatility; ATR-based sizing and stops improve risk management when volatility spikes.

What I will deliver once data fetch succeeds
- A detailed, nuanced trend report for PLTR that integrates the 8 selected indicators.
- Concrete signal read (not a final buy/sell decision yet) showing alignment or conflict among trend, momentum, and volatility signals.
- Practical trade framework (entry/exit/stop ideas) that uses the indicators in a complementary fashion, with caveats for earnings, catalysts, and market regime.
- A concise summary of current interpretation and recommended watch levels.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now, or you can specify an alternative date range/source. If you’re okay with it, I’ll attempt the fetch again and then generate the full report with live indicator readings.
- If you’d prefer to proceed immediately with a qualitative framework (without live data), I can produce a scenario-based interpretation for PLTR using the same indicators, clearly labeling assumptions.

Markdown table: key indicators, purpose, and PLTR-specific notes

| Indicator | Category | Purpose / Signals to Watch | PLTR-specific notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; use with other signals for timing | Helps filter noise in PLTR’s volatile moves; use to confirm mid-term trend alignment with catalysts. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation; watch for golden/death cross | Provides strategic context; best for assessing regime (bullish vs bearish) around earnings or major announcements. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Quick momentum shifts; potential entry points | Sensitive to fast moves; use with longer averages to avoid false signals in choppy markets. |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum signal; MACD line vs. signal line cross; watch divergences | Useful around catalysts when momentum shifts; cross confirmations improve reliability in PLTR’s volatility. |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD Signal line crossover; smoother momentum signals | Helps filter MACD signals; reduces false positives in fast-moving sessions. |
| macdh | MACD Related | MACD Histogram; momentum strength and divergences | Early warning of momentum shifts; divergence with price can signal potential reversals. |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold levels and divergences; typical 70/30 thresholds | In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated; use in conjunction with trend to avoid false reversals. |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility-based risk management; set stops and size bets | Key for PLTR’s volatility; enables adaptive risk controls during earnings runs and macro shocks. |

Status note: Data fetch is currently unavailable due to a file-related error from get_YFin_data. I’m ready to retry or adjust parameters as soon as you authorize, or I can proceed with the above framework to prepare a data-driven trend report once access is restored.
