I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based stock news for NFLX on 2025-10-20, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a temporary environment issue with the data fetch. I can:

- Retry the Reddit data pull now, or
- Use a fallback approach (summarize from other sources or proceed with a structured qualitative report using available context)

Please tell me which you prefer. In the meantime, here’s how I would structure and deliver a thorough long-form analysis once the data can be pulled.

What I will deliver (once data accessible)
- Fresh sentiment snapshot: day-by-day sentiment from Reddit over the past week for NFLX, with key upvoted threads and dominant themes.
- Top themes and sourcing signals: content slate, subscriber/sticker metrics, ad-supported plan, price changes, competitive dynamics (Disney+, Prime Video, etc.), and any notable user concerns (ads experience, password sharing, app UX).
- Recent company/news signals: earnings-related items, subscriber guidance updates, product/features news, partnerships, or regulatory/compliance items that could influence sentiment.
- Sentiment-to-price context: any observed lag/lead relationships between Reddit sentiment shifts and NFLX price moves, with caveats about causation.
- Risks and catalysts: what could trigger a sentiment swing (positive or negative) in the near term.
- Trading implications: guidance for different types of traders (long/short, options, risk management) based on sentiment signals and any news catalysts.
- Quantified takeaways: a concise set of metrics to monitor (e.g., sentiment index level, notable sentiment pivots, upcoming earnings/news dates).
- Visuals and data-ready notes: clear bullet points and charts you could recreate (without exposing any private data).

Appendix: Markdown table for quick reference
I’ll finish with a clean, readable table that distills the key insights. Here’s a placeholder structure you can expect (to be populated with actual data once the Reddit feed is retrieved):

- Topic | Sentiment (Today) | 7-day Trend | Potential Impact on NFLX Price | Key Reddit Evidence
- Subscriber Growth | Neutral/Positive/Negative | Up/Down/Flat | Low/Medium/High | Post IDs or thread themes
- Ad-supported Tier / Pricing | Positive/Negative | Up/Down/Flat | Low/Medium/High | Threads mentioning ads, pricing changes
- Content & Slate | Positive/Negative | Up/Down/Flat | Medium/High | Threads about new releases, renewals
- Competition / Alternatives | Positive/Negative | Up/Down/Flat | Medium/High | Comparisons to Disney+/Prime Video, etc.

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry of the Reddit data fetch right away, or switch to a broader qualitative report using other available signals you’re comfortable sharing or that I can summarize from public headlines you provide. Which path would you prefer?
