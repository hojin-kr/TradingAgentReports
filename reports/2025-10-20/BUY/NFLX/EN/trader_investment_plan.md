Recommendation: Buy NFLX with a disciplined, hedged entry.

Execution plan (concise and actionable)
- Core exposure: Initiate a modest core long position in NFLX at roughly 2-4% of total portfolio risk capital. If you have room for scaling, plan to add in increments only as the earnings read-through and monetization progress validate the bull case.
- Hedging structure (primary): Collar to cap downside and finance upside modestly
  - Buy a protective put: strike near a recent support level or 5-10% below entry, with a 6-12 month horizon.
  - Sell an out-of-the-money call: strike 5-10% above entry, same or near-term expiry, to offset the put cost.
  - Rationale: preserves upside participation within a defined range while limiting downside risk around earnings and near-term volatility.
- Earnings approach: around the Oct earnings window
  - If you’re risk-averse: keep the collar in place and avoid adding naked upside exposure pre-earnings.
  - If you want optionality: consider a limited-risk post-earnings upside play (e.g., a small bull call spread or a short-dated call on a confirmed beat), but keep overall delta exposure within your hedged targets.
- Entry/exit triggers (data-driven): use a multi-signal read rather than a single catalyst
  - Enter or add-on if you observe bullish momentum aligned with: price above key moving averages, MACD positive and increasing, RSI supportive, and price riding near or above the upper Bollinger band.
  - Trim or hedge further if momentum wanes: price breaks below the defined support zone, MACD turns negative, RSI shows weakness, or you hit your predefined stop on the core position.
  - Profit targets: take partial profits around 12-18% upside from entry as a first tier; reassess for larger upside if ad monetization, ARPU uplift, and international subs stay robust toward 25-40% upside.
- Risk controls
  - Position sizing to keep overall risk within your tolerance (2-4% core, with hedges protecting against earnings risk).
  - Define a clear stop/hedge adjustment rule if NFLX breaches a defensible technical level or if the hedge becomes too costly relative to remaining upside.
- Data and monitoring plan (eight indicators to pull when available)
  - 50-day and 200-day moving averages, 10-day EMA
  - MACD, MACD signal, MACD histogram
  - RSI
  - Bollinger upper band
  - Use these to time incremental add-ons or to tighten/adjust hedges around earnings. Strength of alignment (price above moving averages, MACD positive, RSI supportive) supports adding; bearish signals suggest risk-controlled trimming or hedging intensification.

What I learned and how I’ll apply it
- Don’t rely on a single signal or event; use a layered, multi-signal approach to timing.
- Hedge earnings risk with a defined structure rather than a naked long exposure.
- Require progress in monetization metrics (ARPU uplift, ads take-up, international subs) to justify the valuation and to unlock upside.
- Use real-time data signals to guide actions around earnings rather than static commitments.

Next steps and data you’ll want (when available)
- Pull NFLX’s current values for the eight indicators as of 2025-10-20 (close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macds, macdh, rsi, boll_ub).
- Provide a timestamped trend read and a signal table to guide exact entries/exits around the Oct 21 earnings.

Final takeaway
- The plan supports a Buy with a disciplined hedged entry, leveraging Netflix’s multi-faceted growth (international subs, ads-driven ARPU, IP moat) while acknowledging valuation and execution risks. Hedging around earnings and staged exposure allow participation in potential upside while limiting downside.
