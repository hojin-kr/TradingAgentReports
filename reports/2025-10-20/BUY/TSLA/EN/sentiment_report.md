Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to pull the Reddit stock news for TSLA on 2025-10-20, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal issue). I retried twice and it still isn’t functioning on my end right now. I can retry again shortly, or we can proceed with a structured plan and fill in data as soon as the tool is back up (or you provide an alternative data source).

Here’s how I propose we proceed to deliver a comprehensive long-form report as soon as data is available, and a solid framework you can reference in the meantime.

What I can do now (without the Reddit feed)
- Prepare a thorough framework and methodological notes for the long report.
- Outline the key sections, data points, and signal interpretation you’ll get once the Reddit data is accessible.
- Provide a ready-to-fill Markdown table template to organize day-by-day sentiment, themes, and trade implications.

Proposed structure for the long report (TSLA, past week)
1) Executive Summary
- One-page snapshot of current sentiment dynamics on Reddit, notable themes, and immediate implications for TSLA’s price action and volatility.

2) Data and Methodology
- Data sources: Reddit (primary), plus any corroborating sources if/when available (news outlets, social sentiment aggregators, stock-specific forums).
- Time window: last 7 days up to current date (2025-10-20).
- Sentiment scoring approach: how sentiment is aggregated (e.g., positive/neutral/negative counts, weighted by engagement), treatment of memes vs. fundamentals, handling of volatile meme-driven spikes.
- Topic extraction: main themes driving conversations (e.g., EV demand, demand vs. supply, FSD/autonomy, margins, competition, production/capacity, pricing, regulatory headwinds).

3) Daily Sentiment and Topical Breakdown
- For each day, report:
  - Overall sentiment score and directional bias.
  - Key topics driving chatter (bullets with quick examples).
  - Notable threads or influencers (who is driving the narrative, if identifiable).
  - Any explicit price/turchase signals implied by posts (e.g., “short-term buy” memes, risk-off posts).

4) News and Event Lens
- Correlate Reddit sentiment with any salient company news from the week (earnings guidance, product updates, FSD progress, supply chain, regulatory developments).
- Identify any lagged or lead relationships (does sentiment respond to news, or does news respond to sentiment shifts?).

5) Sentiment Stability and Turning Points
- Determine whether sentiment is trending more bullish, bearish, or remains mixed with critical inflection points.
- Identify potential catalysts that could shift sentiment (product announcements, legal/regulatory milestones, key earnings dates).

6) Implications for Traders and Investors
- Short-term trade ideas (within a few days) aligned with sentiment signals.
- Medium-term considerations (1–4 weeks) factoring in macro/backdrop and product trajectory.
- Risk factors and caveats (e.g., meme-driven volatility, risk of sentiment reversal, exposure to broader market moves).

7) Comparative Context
- Quick lens on how TSLA Reddit sentiment has differed from peers (if data allows), or how TSLA’s style of discourse compares to typical EV sector chatter.

8) Key Takeaways and Strategic Signals
- Concise, actionable bullets for traders (e.g., “bearish chatter spikes ahead of regulatory deadlines,” or “bullish sentiment clusters around FSD milestones”).
- What to watch next week (data signals, potential trigger events).

9) Appendices
- Data caveats, methodology notes, glossary of terms used in sentiment analysis.

What I need from you to proceed immediately
- Permission to retry pulling Reddit data as soon as the tool is available again.
- If you prefer, provide an alternate data source you want included (e.g., a known sentiment feed, Twitter/X data you have access to, or a public news feed) and I’ll integrate it with the same structure.

Proposed Markdown table template (to be filled once data is available)
Date | Reddit Sentiment (net) | Overall Tone | Top Topics | Bull Signals | Bear Signals | Notable Threads/Influencers | Related News Headlines | Implied Move Bias | Confidence
- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | -

Notes:
- The table is designed to capture day-by-day sentiment and the key drivers behind it, plus a quick read on how those signals could translate into price or volatility moves.
- I can populate this with actual numbers and narrative once the Reddit feed is functioning again.

Would you like me to:
- Retry now to fetch the Reddit data for TSLA on 2025-10-20 and start populating the full report, or
- Proceed with the outlined framework and wait for data to come in, or
- Use an alternative data source you specify (if you have one) and begin building the report around that while we wait for the Reddit tool to come back?

If you want me to retry now, I’ll run another attempt immediately and then begin compiling the report content as soon as I have results.
