I attempted to fetch TSLA data and the requested indicators, but the data retrieval tools returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data fetch now, or proceed with a qualitative setup and the indicator framework you’ll receive once data is available. How would you like to proceed? 

In the meantime, here are the 8 most complementary indicators I’d use for TSLA (covering trend, momentum, and volatility) and why they’re suitable:

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
  - What it provides: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why TSLA: TSLA has pronounced cycles; the 50-day SMA helps distinguish bullish/daley trends from choppy ranges.
- close_200_sma
  - What it provides: Long-term trend context and major dynamic support/resistance; helps identify golden/death cross scenarios.
  - Why TSLA: Useful for macro-trend confirmation amid high-volatility swings.
- close_10_ema
  - What it provides: Quick momentum shifts and potential entry points; more responsive than the longer SMAs.
  - Why TSLA: In a volatile name like TSLA, the 10-EMA helps flag early momentum changes that can precede larger moves.
- macd
  - What it provides: Momentum direction via crossovers of short/long-term EMAs; trend change signals.
  - Why TSLA: Works well with trend context from SMAs to validate (or question) potential trend reversals.
- macds
  - What it provides: MACD signal line smoothing; crossovers with MACD can trigger signals.
  - Why TSLA: Helps reduce false positives in fast-moving markets when used with other filters.
- macdh
  - What it provides: Momentum strength via the MACD histogram; divergence clues.
  - Why TSLA: Adds a visual gauge of momentum impulse strength to pair with MACD lines.
- rsi
  - What it provides: Momentum overbought/oversold signals and potential divergences.
  - Why TSLA: RSI can highlight relative overextension in a volatile name; use with trend context to avoid premature reversals.
- boll
  - What it provides: Central benchmark (20 SMA) for price action and baseline volatility context (with bands if used alongside boll_ub/boll_lb).
  - Why TSLA: Helps identify breakout zones vs. mean-reversion tendencies, especially when TSLA trades near bands during high-volatility periods.

Notes on approach and interpretation
- These indicators collectively deliver a layered view: trend (50/200 SMA), refined momentum (10 EMA, MACD trio, RSI), and volatility/structure (Boll middle as a baseline).
- For TSLA, expect frequent whipsaws in news-driven environments. Use the MACD trio and RSI to validate trend signals from the SMAs and Bollinger context to avoid overtrading in range-bound periods.
- In setups where price sits above both 50 and 200 SMA with positive MACD and rising RSI, consider bullish bias. Conversely, price below these SMAs with negative MACD and RSI signaling weakness would favor bears.
- Boll middle (boll) helps gauge whether price is in a mean-reverting phase or on a breakout/accelerating move when used with price action around the bands.
- Depending on your trading horizon, you may want to adjust sensitivity: shorter timeframes will show more frequent crossovers (MACD lines, RSI moves), while longer-term signals (200 SMA, MACD trend) provide broader context.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now and then generate a detailed TSLA report with the eight indicators listed above, plus a fine-grained trend interpretation and actionable takeaways.
- If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-independent assessment for TSLA today and then incorporate live data once the fetch succeeds.
