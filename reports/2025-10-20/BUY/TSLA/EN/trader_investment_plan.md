Recommendation: BUY (with disciplined, staged entry and strict risk controls)

Rationale (why this makes sense now)
- Bull thesis alignment: The plan emphasizes Tesla as a multi-rail growth platform—EVs, energy storage, software-enabled services, and monetization potential from FSD/Dojo. Even if one rail slows, others can sustain cash flow growth, supporting a higher earnings power over time.
- Technicals and momentum: The framework notes price action improving, trades above meaningful moving averages, and constructive momentum signals. These indicators support a bullish bias provided risk is controlled.
- Risk-aware setup: The plan already embeds staged entries, clear triggers, and downside protection through stops and position caps. This helps mitigate execution risk if macro or company-specific catalysts underperform.

What to do now (actionable steps)
- Starter position (today): Initiate with 25-30% of target long exposure to TSLA.
- Add-on 1: If TSLA closes above 470 on strong volume and holds that level for 2-3 sessions, add another 25% of target exposure.
- Add-on 2: If TSLA reaches 520–540 and maintains momentum (RSI not overbought and MACD confirming), add the final 20–25% of target exposure.
- Optional top-up/trim: If price moves toward 600+ on a sustained uptrend and fundamentals remain solid, consider a small incremental trim or hold-for-outperformance rather than expanding beyond target exposure.

Risk management and stops
- Core risk cap: Place a close-based stop at or just below the 50-day moving average (or a fixed -7% to -10% on the starter tranche), whichever aligns with your framework.
- Trailing protection: Once the position is up meaningfully (e.g., +10% to +15%), implement a trailing stop (8–12% or a higher moving-average-based trail) to lock in gains.
- Position cap: Limit any single name to roughly 6–8% of total portfolio equity unless a multi-quarter thesis acceleration is evident and fundamentals support a larger exposure.

Monitoring and catalysts
- Weekly check-ins: Confirm price remains above the 50/200-day SMAs, MACD trend is positive, RSI isn’t in danger of overextension, and price sits around or above the Bollinger middle.
- Catalysts to watch: FSD monetization progress, gross margin trajectory, energy backlog progression, factory/capex cadence, regulatory dynamics in China, and the macro rate environment.

Learning and guardrails
- Don’t hinge on a single near-term milestone (e.g., immediate FSD monetization). Favor a diversified cash-flow/margin trajectory across rails and verify milestones with real cash-flow progress.
- Be prepared to scale back exposure if macro headwinds intensify or margins stall. Use staged entries to avoid over-commitment on initial hype.

Would you like me to tailor these levels to a specific starting capital, risk tolerance, and time horizon? I can adjust entry points, stop distances, and the overall target exposure accordingly. If you want, I can also produce a data-backed, indicator-driven version once you provide access to live data feeds.
