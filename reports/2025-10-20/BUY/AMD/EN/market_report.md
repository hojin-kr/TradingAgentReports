I tried to fetch AMD data for 2024-10-01 to 2025-10-20 from Yahoo Finance, but the data retrieval tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError). I retried with the same result. This looks like an internal data-source issue on the backend. I can retry later or proceed with a robust indicator plan you can use once the data is available. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators and a detailed, actionable framework for AMD, plus a concise table of key points.

Recommended indicator set (max 8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
  Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps confirm trend context when combined with faster indicators.
- close_200_sma
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming overarching regime (bullish/bearish) and spotting golden/death cross signals over longer horizons.
- close_10_ema
  Why: Responsive short-term momentum; helps catch quick shifts and potential entry points when trend is in place.
- macd
  Why: Core momentum signal via MACD line crossovers; useful in conjunction with other filters in less volatile regimes.
- macds
  Why: MACD signal line; crossovers with macd offer clearer entry/exit triggers when used with price action.
- macdh
  Why: MACD histogram; shows momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than price moves.
- rsi
  Why: Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold levels and potential reversals; adds a non-linear view to trend signals.
- boll
  Why: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) acts as a volatility-adjusted benchmark; helps interpret price relative to recent volatility and supports breakout/reversion signals when used with bands.

What this set provides
- Trend direction and strength (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA, MACD trio)
- Momentum confirmation and potential reversals (MACD trio, RSI, MACD histogram)
- Volatility context and breakout/workable zones (boll) to gauge squeeze/breakout potential
- A balanced mix of price action, momentum, and volatility without duplicating signals

Nuanced interpretation framework for AMD (contextual guidance)
Note: The following interpretations assume AMD is trading in a typical large-cap semiconductor environment with AI/compute demand dynamics and cyclical chip-equipment availability. Use real-data signals once the data fetch works.

- Bullish scenario (signal synthesis)
  - Price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, suggesting a positive trend regime.
  - 10 EMA trending above 50 SMA, indicating rising short-term momentum.
  - MACD line above MACD signal with a positive MACD histogram, confirming momentum acceleration.
  - RSI above 50 but not yet in overbought territory (e.g., 50–70), supporting continued upside with decompression risk manageable.
  - Price interacting with/near the upper Bollinger band with a widening band suggesting a genuine breakout rather than a false squeeze.
  - VWMA (not in the final 8 here, but useful if you add it) rising with price, validating volume-supported up moves.
  Potential trade idea: look for pullbacks to the 10 EMA or the 50 SMA for entries, with stops below the 50 SMA or ATR-based levels.

- Bearish scenario (signal synthesis)
  - Price below the 50 SMA and 200 SMA, indicating a bear market or downtrend pressure.
  - 10 EMA crossing below 50 SMA, signaling weakening near-term momentum.
  - MACD line below MACD signal and negative MACD histogram, signaling momentum decay.
  - RSI creeping toward or below 50, showing growing downside momentum or lack of breadth.
  - Price near or touching the lower Bollinger band with a potential reversal bias unless followed by further momentum signals.
  - ATR rising suggests increasing volatility; use for dynamic stops and position sizing.

- Mixed/unclear scenario
  - Price hovering around the 50 and 200 SMAs with MACD flat and RSI around 50–60.
  - Bollinger bands tightening; risk of a range breakout.
  - In this case, wait for a decisive MACD cross, a clear price breakout from the Bollinger bands, or a sustained RSI move before taking a position.

Risk management and trade hygiene
- Use ATR to set initial stop-loss distances that reflect current volatility (more volatile markets require wider stops).
- Favor confirmations across multiple indicators before entries (e.g., MACD momentum plus price above key SMAs plus RSI not overbought).
- Consider using a position-sizing rule based on risk per trade (e.g., 1–2% of equity per trade, with stop distance informed by ATR).
- If the data is noisy or thinly traded, lean on longer-horizon signals (50/200 SMA crossovers, MACD histogram trends) rather than quick EMA crossovers alone.

What I can do next (once data retrieval works)
- Re-run the data fetch for AMD for a precise date range.
- Generate the 8 selected indicators from the current data.
- Provide a data-backed trend report with specific signals, levels, and entry/exit ideas.
- Append a concise table of signals, thresholds, and interpretation tailored to AMD’s recent price action.

Key points at a glance (table)
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  Signal interpretation: Price above indicates uptrend; price below indicates downtrend potential.

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and regime confirmation.
  Signal interpretation: Price above/below helps confirm bullish/bearish regime; watch for golden/death cross with the 50 SMA.

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  Purpose: Short-term momentum capture.
  Signal interpretation: Crosses above/below longer SMAs suggest quick entry/exit tendencies; use with trend context.

- Indicator: macd
  Purpose: Core momentum signal.
  Signal interpretation: MACD line crossing above/below MACD signal; alignment with price action strengthens signals.

- Indicator: macds
  Purpose: MACD signal smoothness.
  Signal interpretation: Crossovers with macd reinforce entry/exit timing; pair with RSI to filter false positives.

- Indicator: macdh
  Purpose: Momentum strength visualization.
  Signal interpretation: Positive/negative histogram and divergences help early warnings on momentum shifts.

- Indicator: rsi
  Purpose: Overbought/oversold momentum checks.
  Signal interpretation: Readings above 70 or below 30 signal potential reversals, but consider trend context to avoid false signals.

- Indicator: boll
  Purpose: Volatility-adjusted benchmark (middle band).
  Signal interpretation: Price interaction with the middle band signals mean-reversion or breakout tendencies when combined with bands.

Important: Data access note
- The data retrieval step failed due to an internal backend error. I can retry now or as soon as you’re ready. If you’d like, I can proceed with the indicator plan using hypothetical data, but for actionable trading decisions I’ll need the actual AMD data to compute the indicators and provide precise signals.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch for AMD now, or would you prefer I proceed with the outlined plan using a hypothetical data example to illustrate the signal framework? If you want the exact, signal-ready report, I’ll need the data to return successfully.
