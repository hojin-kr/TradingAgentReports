Thanks for the call. I attempted to fetch Reddit stock info for QQQ on 2025-09-11, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t proceed with that data pull right now.

How would you like to proceed? Options:
- Retry now: I can try the Reddit data pull again immediately and then build the full report once it returns.
- Use alternative data sources: I can assemble a comprehensive sentiment and news synthesis from other accessible sources (e.g., general stock news, macro context, and any other feeds you approve) and deliver the long-form report with the day-by-day sentiment breakdown.
- You provide data: If you have a data file or another API I can query, share it and I’ll analyze it to produce the report.

If you’d like, I can also outline the structure of the full report I’ll deliver once we have data, so you know what to expect:
- Summary: current state of QQQ sentiment vs. news catalysts over the past week
- Daily sentiment breakdown: key dots for each day (volume of mentions, net sentiment, top themes)
- Top news and social signals: headlines, posts, and notable quotes influencing sentiment
- Implications for traders: potential bullish/bearish setups, risk factors, sensitivity to macro events
- Craft recommended ranges: entry/exit considerations, volatility context, and liquidity notes
- Markdown table: compact key takeaways by day and category

Tell me which path you’d like, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
