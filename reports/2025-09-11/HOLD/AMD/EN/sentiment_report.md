Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to pull the latest AMD Reddit stock data, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t fetch the live Reddit feed for AMD right now. Here’s how I’ll proceed and what I can deliver immediately, plus what I’ll fill once the data tool comes back online.

What I can do right now
- Provide a comprehensive framework for the AMD social-media sentiment and news analysis, tailored for traders.
- Outline the likely themes to watch, potential sentiment drivers, and implications for risk management and positioning.
- Deliver a ready-to-use report structure and a Markdown table template that will be populated with the actual Reddit sentiment data as soon as the tool is available.

What to expect in the full analysis (once Reddit data is retrieved)
- Daily sentiment sweep: a day-by-day sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative) for AMD over the past week, with top positive and negative themes.
- Top Reddit threads and gist of discussions (e.g., AI/ML compute demand, gaming GPU pricing, supply chain, NDA/earnings cadence, competing chipmakers, new product announcements).
- Correlation notes between sentiment spikes and key company news or macro events.
- Thematic breakdown: AI accelerators and data-center demand, consumer GPU demand and pricing dynamics, supply constraints, gross margin expectations, and guidance implications.
- Trader implications: how sentiment shifts might translate into risk-on/risk-off moves, price support/resistance considerations, and potential catalysts.

Key drivers and themes to monitor for AMD (context to guide the analysis)
- AI/Data-center demand: Nvidia-centric AI spending and AMD’s position in GPUs/AI accelerators; data-center capex cycles and new product announcements (e.g., RDNA/MI lineups, Instinct/MI accelerators).
- Gaming GPU cycle: pricing, competing GPUs, and demand from PC/console ecosystems; impact of new game releases and driver updates.
- Product roadmaps and launches: any leaks or official launches that drive excitement or concern; product performance rumors vs. real benchmarks.
- Supply chain and gross margins: foundry dynamics, wafer supply, costs, and mix shifts that impact earnings trajectory.
- Competitive landscape: responses to Nvidia/Intel accelerators, potential strategic partnerships or licensing news.
- Macro factors: semis cycle timing, AI demand resilience, and consumer demand signals.

Recommended next steps (your call)
- Option A: I wait for the Reddit tool to return data and then deliver the full, data-driven AMD report with a detailed sentiment map and a filled Markdown table.
- Option B: I proceed now with a fully fleshed-out narrative (analysis, interpretation, and risk signals) based on the framework above, and I’ll drop in the Reddit-derived insights as soon as the tool is available.
- Option C: You provide alternative data sources (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment snapshot, other social platforms, or a recent AMD news digest) and I’ll weave those in immediately.

Proposed Markdown table template (to be filled with actual data once available)
- I’ll append this table at the end of the full report with real figures once Reddit data is retrieved.

| Date (AMD) | Source/Platform | Theme/Topic | Sentiment (Pos/Neu/Neg) | Key Thread Snippet | Implications for AMD (Short) | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|------|
| TBD        | Reddit (AMD)   | AI/data-center demand | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| TBD        | Reddit (AMD)   | Gaming GPU pricing | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| TBD        | Reddit (AMD)   | Supply chain/margins | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| TBD        | Reddit (AMD)   | Product launch rumors | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| TBD        | Reddit (AMD)   | Competitive dynamics | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Would you like me to proceed with Option A (wait for Reddit data and then deliver the full, data-filled report) or Option B (start with the narrative framework now and fill in Reddit specifics as soon as the tool works again)? If you have a preferred alternative data source (e.g., a specific set of headlines or a sentiment snapshot from another platform), tell me and I’ll incorporate it right away.
