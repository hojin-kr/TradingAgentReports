Recommendation
- Hold AMD stock now. Maintain a disciplined, discounted-risk stance and stay ready to upgrade to Buy if catalysts prove durable across multiple quarters (not just a single data point).

Rationale
- Positive multi-year tailwinds: AI/data-center demand, MI/EPYC ramp, ROCm ecosystem, and a diversified CPU+GPU+software stack support a long-term growth thesis.
- Near-term uncertainties: AI cycles can be cyclical and lumpy; policy headwinds (e.g., China/export controls) and execution risk (MI ramp timing, software adoption, product cadence) could weigh on near-term performance.
- Valuation sensitivity: The stock may rely on multiple catalysts to justify higher multiple; backlog quality and visibility matter for sustained upside.
- Backlog visibility: Multi-quarter visibility is crucial. Without credible backlog acceleration, upside is uncertain even within a strong AI narrative.

Key catalysts to monitor (and why they matter)
- Backlog/order momentum outside China: Determines near-term revenue visibility and risk premium.
- MI/EPYC ramp milestones and ROCm adoption: Signals execution discipline and software-enabled monetization.
- Data-center gross margin progress: Indicates leverage from higher-margin software-enabled products and mix shifts.
- Policy/regulatory developments: China/export controls or easing could materially impact demand trajectories.
- Cloud/enterprise wins and FSR 4 milestones: Concrete, durable revenue streams beyond a few marquee announcements.

Risk controls and portfolio management
- Position sizing: Begin with a modest core position (1–2% of portfolio); add only on confirmed pullbacks with favorable odds.
- Patience ladder: Implement staged add-ons at predefined pullbacks rather than chasing strength.
- Stops and hedges: Use ATR-based stops (1.5–2.0x ATR) and consider protective hedges (puts or collars) on a portion of the position to cap downside while preserving upside.
- Earnings posture: Avoid large, binary exposure around results unless you’re prepared for volatility and have a plan to manage it.

Judging progress and decision framework
- Move from Hold to Buy if: sustained, multi-quarter backlog growth across non-China regions; clear MI/EPYC ramp milestones; and margin leverage consistent with data-center mix, with no material policy headwind or competitive disruption.
- Reassess to Sell or trim if: backlog decelerates meaningfully, non-China demand falters, policy headwinds intensify, or ROIC/margin improvements fail to materialize as expected.

Contingency playbook
- If catalysts prove durable: consider upgrading to Buy with scaled exposure or use options strategies (e.g., long-dated calls or call spreads) to capture upside while managing risk.
- If risks intensify: tighten risk controls, reduce exposure, or switch to hedged alternatives to preserve capital.

Final takeaway
- The AMD thesis remains credible over the long term, but near-term risks and valuation sensitivity argue for a cautious stance. A Hold preserves exposure to a durable growth story while demanding multi-quarter proof of backlog strength, MI/EPYC ramp, and margin improvement. Stay disciplined, await clear catalysts, and be prepared to switch to Buy on durable, repeatable progress.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
