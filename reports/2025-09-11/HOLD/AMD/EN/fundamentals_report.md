I ran into a tool environment error trying to fetch the data (FileNotFoundError). I can’t pull the insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financial statements right now. Here are your options and how I can proceed:

Options
- Retry now: I can attempt to fetch all data again immediately and then produce the full, up-to-date AMD fundamentals report with insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow, plus a final summary table.
- Proceed with a qualitative AMD fundamentals report: I’ll outline AMD’s fundamental picture and potential trader-focused insights based on typical factors (segment mix, AI/data-center cycle, product roadmap, margin trends, balance sheet health) without the latest week data. I’ll clearly label where data will be filled in once the tools are available.
- Hybrid approach: I can draft a detailed report framework (sections, key metrics to watch, and exact data points to extract) and fill in numbers as soon as the tool access is restored.

What I’ll deliver (once data is available)
- Company profile and business overview
- Latest quarterly/annual financials: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow (quarterly, with year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter context)
- Insider sentiment (past 30 days)
- Insider transactions (past 30 days)
- Analysis and insights tailored for traders: margins, profitability trajectory, cash conversion, balance sheet strength, liquidity, capital allocation, and potential catalysts/risks
- A concise, trader-focused takeaway with actionable guidance
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points (metrics, direction, and commentary)

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to try again right away, I’ll re-attempt to pull all data and (assuming success) deliver the full report in one go.
