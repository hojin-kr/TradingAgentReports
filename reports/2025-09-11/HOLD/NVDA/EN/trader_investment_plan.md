Recommendation: Hold NVDA

Rationale
- The current bull case for NVDA remains intact over the long horizon, but several near-term headwinds are material: high valuation, China/export/regulatory exposure, competitive pressure from XPUs, and Rubin CPX execution risk. Given these risks, deploying new capital at this juncture is not favorable.
- A disciplined hold preserves NVDA’s strategic advantages (CUDA ecosystem, AI compute leadership) while managing downside through defined risk controls and explicit re-evaluation triggers.

Actions to implement (risk-managed hold)
- Position sizing
  - If already overweight NVDA, trim toward a moderate core exposure (target 2–3% of the portfolio for NVDA as a core holding, aligned with your AI exposure budget).
  - Use ATR-based sizing to adjust position size relative to current volatility.
  - Establish a defined maximum drawdown limit on the position over the next 8–12 weeks (e.g., cap potential loss at a small percentage of portfolio equity).
- Hedging and risk mitigation
  - Consider a protective hedge (e.g., a put option sleeve or a collar) to limit downside while allowing participation in upside.
  - If NVDA rallies strongly and reaches overextended technical levels, tighten stops or trim exposure to lock in gains.
- Catalysts and monitoring schedule
  - Track Rubin CPX milestones (deployment velocity, software attach rates) and any early demand signals.
  - Monitor regulatory/export developments and shifts in geography mix guidance; adjust exposure if policy risk intensifies.
  - Watch AI capex momentum: cloud backlog, pricing power, and product cadence (hardware/software integration).
  - Use earnings guidance and margin trajectory as primary re-risk signals.
- Entry/exit triggers to reassess a Buy or Sell
  - Buy/reload trigger: sustained positive data on Rubin CPX ramp, stable policy environment, and valuation that aligns with growth/profit trajectory plus a clean price breakout with volume.
  - Sell/trim trigger: material guidance deterioration, worsening regulatory/geopolitical signals, declining backlog or enterprise AI spend momentum, or technical breakdown (e.g., price breaking below key moving averages with negative momentum indicators).
- Portfolio approach
  - Maintain diversification within AI/semis to reduce single-name risk; complement NVDA with other AI compute players or software ecosystems to balance exposure.
- Process improvements (learning from decisions)
  - Don’t rely on a single catalyst. Validate with multiple data points (hardware cadence, software moat, enterprise demand, policy landscape).
  - Use scenario planning (base/bear/severe bear) with explicit probability weights and price paths.
  - Anchor decisions to objective signals rather than headlines; update risk framework as policy and market dynamics evolve.

Implementation timeline
- Immediate (1–2 weeks): adjust position size toward target exposure; set or confirm protective hedges; establish explicit stop levels and review triggers.
- Short term (4–8 weeks): monitor Rubin CPX milestones, policy developments, and demand signals; reassess risk controls and position sizing.
- Medium term (8–16 weeks): if catalysts converge positively with a justifiable growth/margin path and valuation remains reasonable, consider a controlled increase in exposure; otherwise, maintain or progressively reduce if risk/reward deteriorates.

Lessons applied
- Emphasize a multi-signal approach rather than relying on a single catalyst (Rubin CPX alone). Use a defined risk budget and objective triggers to re-risk.
- Build explicit scenarios and risk management into the plan to avoid overexposure during volatility or policy shocks.
- Prioritize policy and macro risk as core considerations alongside fundamentals and technicals.
