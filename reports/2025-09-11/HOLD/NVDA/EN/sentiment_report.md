I hit an internal error trying to fetch Reddit data for NVDA on 2025-09-11: FileNotFoundError. The Reddit data tool is unavailable right now. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

- Retry now: I can attempt to fetch the Reddit data again in a moment if you’d like.
- Alternative data sources: I can produce a thorough NVDA analysis using other public signals (news headlines, earnings-related coverage, official company updates, sentiment proxies from other social platforms) and clearly mark where Reddit data would go once available.
- Manual input: If you have specific Reddit summaries or links you want included, paste them and I’ll integrate them into the report.

What would you prefer? If you’d like, I can start with a best-effort NVDA report using available non-Reddit sources and outline exactly what the Reddit-driven sentiment would add once the tool comes back online. I will also append a Markdown table at the end to organize key points.
