Recommendation: HOLD (with hedged exposure)

Why this stance fits:
- Near-term catalysts are uncertain and multi-faceted, with credible risks around robotaxi monetization timing, regulatory/policy shifts, competition, and potential dilution.
- Long-term bull case remains compelling, driven by software/services, energy ecosystem, and AI/robotics flywheel, but the plan emphasizes waiting for measurable progress before committing more capital.
- A hedged stance preserves upside if catalysts materialize while limiting downside if near-term milestones disappoint.

Actionable execution plan:
- Position management
  - Move to a neutral-to-mimimal overweight stance on TSLA. Avoid large directional bets; maintain a defined-weight exposure that aligns with your risk tolerance.

- Hedging framework (defensive and cost-conscious)
  - Protective put approach: buy out-of-the-money puts with 6–12 months to expiry to cap downside while preserving upside.
  - Collar approach (cost-efficient): long TSLA stock, long OTM puts, and short calls at a higher strike to finance the put protection.
  - If hedges are costly, implement shorter-dated hedges around key catalyst windows and adjust as pricing evolves.

- Catalyst-driven planning
  - Define 2–4 catalyst windows (e.g., quarterly results, robotaxi milestones, regional regulatory updates).
  - If credible robotaxi revenue is demonstrated with positive unit economics in any region, consider modestly increasing long exposure over time.
  - If milestones slip or policy turns negative, enhance hedges or reduce exposure further.

- Risk monitoring and triggers
  - Price-based trigger: if TSLA drops beyond a defined drawdown from a local high without offsetting positive catalysts, tighten hedges or reduce exposure.
  - Catalyst trigger: if a clear, repeatable robotaxi monetization milestone is announced, re-evaluate a higher-quality long tilt.
  - Monitor autonomy milestones, international margin progression, and policy trajectory (credits/subsidies, autonomous-driving regulations).

- Review cadence
  - Quarterly thesis review to incorporate new data (deliveries, robotaxi progress, energy-services uptake, regulatory updates) and adjust hedges/position size accordingly.

- Learning from prior approaches
  - Emphasizes milestone-driven decision points, explicit hedging to manage risk, and scenario-based planning rather than relying on a single narrative or sentiment.

If you want, I can tailor the hedge specifics (put strikes, maturities, or collar components) to your capital, liquidity needs, and preferred option maturities.
