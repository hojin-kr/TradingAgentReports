It looks like the data fetch tools are currently failing (FileNotFoundError from the backend). I can’t retrieve insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financial statements for TSLA right now.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval now or on a schedule you prefer.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a qualitative fundamentals assessment for TSLA using general knowledge (without the latest data) and clearly label it as non-fetched, so you know what would be updated once the data tools come back.
- Prepare the full report structure with placeholders so we can drop in the exact figures as soon as the data tools are operational again.
- If you want, I can focus on a subset (e.g., just insider sentiment and transactions, or just balance sheet/cash flow) once the tools are back.

Recommended next steps
- Would you like me to retry the data fetch now? If yes, I’ll run all tools again and then deliver a comprehensive TSLA fundamentals report with a final Markdown table summarizing key points.
- If you prefer not to wait, I can provide:
  - A detailed framework for the report (sections, what each data point means for traders, and what to look for)
  - A qualitative, non-numeric analysis of Tesla’s fundamental storytelling (growth drivers, margins, cash flow quality, financing needs, and potential catalysts/risks) with explicit caveats that data is unavailable until the tools return.

Report structure you’ll get (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: one-pager of the latest available fundamentals.
- Company profile: business model, segments (Automotive, Energy) and regional exposure.
- Income statement highlights (quarterly): revenue trends, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS if available.
- Balance sheet highlights: liquidity (cash, equivalents), debt levels, working capital, asset quality.
- Cash flow highlights: operating cash flow, capex intensity, free cash flow.
- Income statement/cash flow balance sheet trends: year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter perspectives.
- Insider sentiment: summary of the past 30 days (biased toward potential catalysts or warnings).
- Insider transactions: notable buys/sells in the past 30 days and inferred implications.
- Key risk factors and catalysts: supply chain, demand, regulation, competition, energy mix, EV pricing, and capital expenditure plans.
- Trader-oriented insights: what the numbers imply for margins, cash generation, and equity/debt flexibility; potential scenarios (bullish/bearish) based on data patterns.
- Markdown table: a concise, readable table of key points (metric, trend, interpretation, risk/catalyst).

If you’d like me to proceed with a retry now, I’ll kick off the data fetches again and deliver the full report as soon as the tools respond. Please confirm.
