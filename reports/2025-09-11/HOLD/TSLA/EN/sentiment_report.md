Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based sentiment data for TSLA for the dates you requested, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. Specifically, the Reddit data pull did not execute due to an internal tool issue, so I don’t have the daily sentiment deltas, top threads, or influencer signals to analyze yet. I can retry immediately or on a schedule, but in the meantime I can still lay out a thorough plan, interim observations, and a structured framework for you to review once the data comes through.

What happened and next steps
- What happened: The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all requested dates (2025-09-11 through 2025-09-05). This means I don’t currently have the Reddit sentiment feed to quantify daily positivity/negativity, thread volume, or key topics.
- Immediate option: I can retry now or at a set cadence (e.g., every 5–10 minutes) until the tool responds.
- Alternative: If you have any other sources or an offline dataset (e.g., a CSV export of Reddit sentiment, or links to specific Reddit threads), you can share them and I’ll integrate them into the report.
- What I can still deliver now: a comprehensive report framework, a plan for the sentiment analysis, and a placeholder-filled draft you can fill in quickly once data returns. I will include a final Markdown table at the end with the key points, ready to populate.

Proposed approach I’ll follow once data is available (and what you’ll get)
- Coverage scope: Reddit-based sentiment, on a day-by-day basis for the last 7–10 days, plus a synthesis of notable threads and influencer activity. I will combine this with a concise snapshot of “recent company news” to contextualize sentiment (e.g., production updates, demand dynamics, leadership comments, policy/regulatory signals).
- Sentiment parsing: 
  - Daily sentiment split: Positive, Neutral, Negative (with percentages and counts).
  - Volume signals: Post counts, unique posters, and engagement (upvotes, comments) indicating the strength of sentiment on each day.
  - Thematic signals: Emerging topics driving sentiment (e.g., production ramp, margins, FSD/robotaxi, Cybertruck, stock action, competition, supply chain).
  - Notable influencers: Key Reddit subreddits and high-traffic posters influencing sentiment (quantified by post/view counts and engagement).
- Price/volume context: Where possible, align sentiment signals with intraday/close price movement and trading volume for the same date window to infer potential sentiment-to-price linkage.
- Risk and catalyst flags: Identify narrative-driven risks (e.g., supply chain hiccups, demand signs, regulatory headwinds) and catalysts (e.g., new product launches, earnings tone, delivery updates) that sentiment might be signaling.
- Trader-oriented takeaways: 
  - Short- to mid-term implications for TSLA’s risk/reward with respect to sentiment momentum.
  - Likely timing windows where sentiment could act as a contrarian or momentum signal.
  - Suggested positioning ranges (e.g., entry/exit bands, option strategies to consider if sentiment aligns with price action).
- Presentation: A clean, investor-focused narrative with granular day-by-day detail and a concise synthesis at the end.

Interim structure you’ll see in the final report (once data returns)
- Executive summary: Key sentiment takeaways, notable themes, and what it could mean for TSLA’s near-term price action.
- Data & methodology: Sources, date ranges, sentiment categories, and any caveats about Reddit data.
- Daily sentiment snapshots (by date): Positive %, Negative %, Neutral %, post counts, top themes.
- Thematic digests: The most frequent topics, notable threads, and influencer activity.
- Price/volume alignment: Any observed correlations or discordance with TSLA price action.
- News cross-check: Brief synthesis of relevant company updates in the same window.
- Trader implications: Actionable notes for risk management, catalysts to watch, and suggested trading stances.
- Appendix: Short glossary and any notes about data limitations.

What you’ll get in the final Markdown table
I’ll append a Markdown table at the end of the report with a compact, trader-friendly view. Right now I’ll provide a placeholder structure you can fill once data is back:

- Table: Daily Sentiment & Implications (placeholder until data arrives)
| Date | Positive Sentiment % | Negative Sentiment % | Neutral % | Daily Post Count | Top Themes (brief) | Notable Threads/Instruments Mentioned | Implication for TSLA price action | Suggested Trading Stance |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2025-09-11 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2025-09-10 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2025-09-09 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2025-09-08 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2025-09-07 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2025-09-06 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2025-09-05 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Next actions
- I can retry the Reddit data pull immediately and report back with the actual figures. Please confirm if you’d like me to retry now, or specify a retry window.
- If you have alternative data sources or a connected news feed you want included, share them and I’ll integrate.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull right away and then deliver the full, stitched report with the daily sentiment curve and trader-focused insights as soon as the data lands? If you prefer, I can also proceed with a high-confidence interim report that clearly isolates what we know (and what we don’t yet know) and includes a robust planning framework for when data returns.
