I tried to fetch TSLA data but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError (the data retrieval endpoint isn’t accessible right now). I can retry, or we can proceed with a solid indicator framework so you’re ready as soon as data is available. Below is a detailed, nuanced plan for TSLA based on the eight indicators I would select to balance trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management.

Indicator framework I would apply (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to interpret for TSLA: Price trading above 50SMA suggests a bullish mid-term bias; price below hints at a bearish or consolidating mid-term period. Use as a trend anchor to filter entries from faster signals.
  - Trade use: Use 50SMA as a trend filter; consider pullbacks to or near the 50SMA as potential bounce zones in uptrends; in downtrends, it can act as resistance.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark, trend confirmation, major support/resistance level.
  - How to interpret for TSLA: Price above 200SMA reinforces a long-term uptrend; price below reinforces a long-term downtrend. Crosses (golden/death) are powerful confirmation signals but tend to be slower.
  - Trade use: Align entries with the 200SMA trend direction; be cautious of whipsaws around the cross if volatility is high.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum and rapid price shifts.
  - How to interpret for TSLA: Quick signals of momentum shifts; a price/close crossing above the 10EMA can indicate near-term bullish momentum, while crossing below suggests near-term bearish momentum.
  - Trade use: Use as a trigger for early entries/exits when paired with longer-term trend filters (50SMA/200SMA). Be mindful of noise in choppy markets.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Momentum and trend changes via differences of EMAs.
  - How to interpret for TSLA: Bullish cross (MACD line crossing above MACD signal) and MACD rising toward or above zero can confirm momentum in a rising phase; bearish cross signals potential reversals.
  - Trade use: Combine with trend direction (50SMA/200SMA) to reduce false positives; prefer crossovers that align with the longer-term trend.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: Smoothing of MACD line to provide trade signals.
  - How to interpret for TSLA: Crosses of MACD with MACDS serve as confirmatory signals; a MACD crossing MACDS upward reinforces bullish momentum when long-term trend is positive.
  - Trade use: Use MACDS crossovers in conjunction with MACD and price position relative to moving averages to filter false entries.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: Momentum strength and pace (distance between MACD and signal).
  - How to interpret for TSLA: Increasing histogram bars indicate strengthening momentum in the current direction; shrinking bars warn of potential exhaustion or a reversal.
  - Trade use: Watch for divergences between price and MACD histogram as early warning: if price makes new highs but histogram fails to, consider a potential top.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: Relative momentum and momentum extremes (overbought/oversold tendencies).
  - How to interpret for TSLA: RSI can get extended in strong trends (overbought in uptrends, oversold in downtrends). Look for divergences between RSI and price as potential reversal signals, especially when the price is near long-term supports/resistances.
  - Trade use: Use RSI with trend context from the moving averages. Avoid relying on RSI alone in strongly trending TSLA; prefer signals that align with the broader trend.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it measures: Market volatility (range-based).
  - How to interpret for TSLA: Higher ATR signals higher volatility; lower ATR indicates calmer periods.
  - Trade use: Use ATR to size positions and set stop-loss levels that reflect current volatility (e.g., stop at a multiple of ATR). Helps manage risk in TSLA’s typical volatility environment.

Proposed next steps
- I can retry fetching TSLA data now to generate a concrete, data-driven report with these indicators and a detailed trend/timing analysis.
- Alternatively, you can confirm a date range or let me proceed with the latest available data once the data service is accessible.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret for TSLA | Trade/usage notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Price above suggests bullish bias; below suggests bearish/confidence in downside | Use as a trend filter; pair with faster signals for entries |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; major support/resistance | Price above confirms long-term uptrend; below confirms downtrend | Align entries with 200SMA; watch for golden/death cross signals but be cautious of whipsaws |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; quick shifts | Cross/close above indicates near-term bullish momentum; below indicates bearish momentum | Use as a trigger with longer-term trend as filter; can be noisy in choppy markets |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend changes | Bullish MACD cross and rising toward positive territory supports up moves; bearish cross suggests down moves | Combine with trend anchors to reduce false signals |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothed MACD line | MACD crossing MACDS upward strengthens bullish momentum; downward cross supports bearish momentum | Use as confirmation alongside MACD and price position |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Growing histogram indicates strengthening momentum in current direction; shrinking suggests potential exhaustion | Look for divergences with price as early reversal signals |
| rsi | RSI | Momentum/overbought-oversold | Extreme readings may occur in trends; divergences can signal reversals | Use with trend context; not a sole signal in TSLA’s volatility |
| atr | ATR | Market volatility | Higher ATR = higher volatility; lower ATR = calmer periods | Size positions and set stops using ATR multiples for dynamic risk control |

If you’d like, I can attempt the data fetch again now, or you can specify a date window (e.g., last 90 days, last 180 days) and I’ll tailor the report as soon as data retrieval succeeds.
