Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit stock data for META on 2025-09-11, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). I can retry, or we can proceed with a qualitative framework and prepare the structure of the long report while we resolve the data fetch issue. Here are two options:

- Option A: Retry now to pull the Reddit sentiment data and proceed with a full, data-driven report.
- Option B: Proceed with a detailed qualitative framework (themes, potential catalysts, and trading implications) and populate the data as soon as the tool works.

If you’re okay with it, I’ll retry immediately and then deliver a comprehensive, data-backed META report. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan and a ready-to-fill template so we can drop in the data as soon as it’s available.

What I will deliver (once data is available)
- A comprehensive long-form report analyzing social media sentiment (Reddit and other sources if accessible), recent company news, and sentiment trends over the past week for META.
- Fine-grained insights for traders/investors, including:
  - Daily sentiment digest with tone, volume, and notable themes
  - News catalysts and their potential market impact
  - Thematic drivers (AI, advertising demand, Metaverse progress, regulatory risk, competition)
  - Risk factors and scenario analysis
  - Trading signals and implied volatility considerations (where data allows)
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference

Markdown table (to organize key points)
| Topic | Sentiment Signal (Past Week) | Notable News/Catalysts | Potential Impact on Price | Confidence / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Social sentiment | To be populated from Reddit and other sources | To be populated with week’s headlines | Short-term directional bias | Data quality may vary; cross-check with other sources |
| AI/product updates | To be populated | To be populated with product/news events | Moderate to strong impact if monetizable features are announced | Moderate confidence pending data |
| Advertising/monetization | To be populated | To be populated | High relevance for revenue trajectory | High if signals align with ad demand data |
| Metaverse costs/progress | To be populated | To be populated | Mixed; potential margin implications | Low to moderate confidence until concrete milestones |
| Regulatory risk | To be populated | To be populated | Potential downside if restrictions tighten | Moderate confidence based on macro/regulatory signals |

Next steps
- Option A: I’ll retry the Reddit data pull for META on 2025-09-11 and then deliver a fully data-driven long report with the table above populated.
- Option B: I’ll proceed with a qualitative, data-light version now and fill in the data as soon as the Reddit tool succeeds.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and I’ll proceed immediately. If you want me to retry now, I’ll run the data pull again right away.
