I tried to fetch META data for the requested window, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a system issue on the data layer right now. I can retry the fetch, try a narrower date range, or proceed with a qualitative framework and ready-to-run indicator list so you’re ready once data access is restored. Below is a concrete plan and the indicator set I would use, along with why they’re suitable for META in a typical modern market regime.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it gives: Intermediate trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why META: Helps confirm the prevailing trend and aligns with longer-term levels for potential pullbacks.
  - Interpretation cue: Price above 50 SMA on a sustained basis suggests a bullish bias; price below suggests bearish/soft trend.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it gives: Long-term trend benchmark and potential golden/death cross context.
  - Why META: Provides macro-trend context; crossovers with price action offer strategic signals rather than frequent entries.
  - Interpretation cue: Price above 200 SMA indicates longer-term bullishness; price below indicates longer-term bearishness.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it gives: Responsive short-term momentum signal.
  - Why META: Captures quicker shifts in momentum that can precede larger trend moves.
  - Interpretation cue: Price cross above/below 10 EMA can signal near-term entries/exits, but expect more noise in choppy markets.
- macd (MACD)
  - What it gives: Momentum via differences between fast/slow EMAs; crossovers indicate momentum changes.
  - Why META: Combines with trend context (50/200 SMA) to filter entry signals in trending vs. range-bound conditions.
  - Interpretation cue: MACD line crossing above the signal line is bullish; cross below is bearish; look for confirmation with other indicators.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it gives: Smoother version of MACD to confirm cross signals.
  - Why META: Reduces false positives from MACD alone; helps validate momentum shifts.
  - Interpretation cue: MACD crossing the MACD Signal line in the same direction strengthens the signal.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it gives: Momentum strength gauge via the gap between MACD and its signal.
  - Why META: Divergence between price and MACD histogram can signal weakening or strengthening momentum.
  - Interpretation cue: Growing positive histogram supports bullish momentum; growing negative histogram supports bearish momentum.
- rsi (RSI)
  - What it gives: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold condition assessment.
  - Why META: Complements momentum signals from MACD; helps identify potential reversals or pullbacks in extended moves.
  - Interpretation cue: RSI > 70 suggests overbought/possible pullback; RSI < 30 suggests oversold/possible bounce. Use with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- atr (ATR)
  - What it gives: Volatility level to inform risk management and position sizing.
  - Why META: Helps calibrate stop-loss distances and adapt position sizing to current market volatility, critical in a stock with varying volatility like META.
  - Interpretation cue: Rising ATR implies higher noise/volatility; consider wider stops or tighter risk controls; falling ATR implies calmer periods with tighter stops.

How I will report once data is available
- Synthesize trend context from 50SMA/200SMA alignment (e.g., price above both, price between, or below both).
- Integrate MACD/macds/macdh signals with price and SMA context to identify momentum-confirmed entries/exits.
- Use RSI to spot overextended moves or potential reversals, filtered by the broader trend.
- Apply ATR to quantify risk and set sensible stop levels proportional to current volatility.
- Provide a nuanced scenario analysis (bullish, bearish, and range-bound) with corresponding entry/exit ideas and risk management notes.
- Highlight potential divergences (price vs MACD histogram or RSI) that could precede a change in regime.
- Include caveats for choppy markets where signals from momentum indicators may yield false positives; emphasize relying on multi-indicator confluence rather than a single signal.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now and run the eight indicators in the exact combination above. If you prefer, I can try a narrower date window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to improve responsiveness, or proceed with a qualitative baseline while the data layer is repaired.
- Please confirm: would you like me to retry automatically, or would you prefer a specific date range (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-11) or a shorter look-back (e.g., 90 days) to expedite results?
