META: The current official plan you shared leans to a Hold, and my assessment aligns with that stance.

Decision: HOLD

Rationale (condensed):
- Bear risks are material in the near term: ROI/timing risk on AI and metaverse bets, ongoing capex/opex drag, regulatory/safety costs, and ad-market cyclicality. The stock already embeds a strong bullish outlook, so any execution hiccup can compress downside.
- Bull case remains plausible over the longer horizon, but the near-term path to durable margin expansion and rapid monetization is not clearly visible yet. No clean near-term earnings catalyst is guaranteed.
- What would tilt to Buy: credible, sustained improvements in monetization and cash flow, with clear margin expansion signals, plus confirmatory catalysts (e.g., Meta Connect 2025 milestones or quarterly results showing ROIC/FCF uplift and a path to higher profitability).

Triggers or conditions to upgrade to Buy (for planning purposes):
- Price action: a move to a sustained uptrend confirmed by price closing above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, with positive MACD and rising RSI.
- Fundamentals: two consecutive quarters of accelerating ad-revenue growth or monetization metrics (especially Reels/WhatsApp), plus a visible moderation in capex intensity relative to revenue and a credible path to margin expansion.
- Catalysts: stronger-than-expected updates at Meta Connect 2025 or quarterly prints showing ROIC/FCF uplift and a clear margin expansion trajectory in the next 4–6 quarters.

Risk controls and positioning (practical steps):
- Keep META exposure moderate; avoid overconcentration. If already overweight, trim toward a neutral or modest overweight with strict risk limits.
- Apply ATR-based risk rules (e.g., stop loss around 1.5–2x recent ATR, adjusted for liquidity and gaps).
- Consider hedging or layering in a staged way only after confirming the upgrade signals.

Monitoring plan (key data points):
- Ad-revenue growth, Reels monetization progress, and cash-flow trajectory.
- Capex intensity vs. revenue growth and near-term margin trajectory.
- Regulatory developments and potential cost implications.
- Macro ad-market conditions and competitive dynamics (TikTok/YouTube).

Bottom line:
- Given the balance of near-term risks and longer-term optionality, the Hold stance is prudent. I’ll recompute the stance only if tangible, data-backed improvements in monetization and margins materialize, supported by clear catalysts.
