I attempted to fetch GOOG data and run the requested indicators, but the data tools are returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. Specifically, the following attempts failed:
- Parallel fetch of GOOG data and multiple indicators
- Individual call to get_YFin_data for GOOG (start 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-11)

Because I don’t have the actual price series right now, I can’t compute the precise indicator values or provide a data-driven trend report. I can still help in two ways:
- Provide a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) that will give you a complementary, non-redundant view once the data loads.
- Give detailed guidance on how to interpret those indicators for GOOG in the current market context, plus a structured table you can reference when the data becomes available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators total)
Reason for selection: This mix covers trend direction, momentum, volatility, and a volume-aware perspective without overlapping signals. Once data loads, these will provide a balanced view to confirm signals and reduce false positives.

- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these are suitable for GOOG now
- Trend confirmation: 50 SMA and 200 SMA give you a sense of medium- to long-term trend. A rising 50 SMA above a rising 200 SMA (golden cross) is a classic bullish confirmation; a cross below can signal caution or trend weakening.
- Short-term momentum: 10 EMA provides a responsive read on near-term price momentum, helping to time entries when aligned with longer-term trend signals.
- Momentum cycling: MACD and MACD Signal (macd and macds) help identify momentum shifts and crossovers with an additional smoothing layer. They are especially useful in mixed markets where price action is choppy.
- Overbought/oversold context: RSI helps flag potential reversals or pullbacks when momentum becomes extreme. Divergences between price and RSI can be early warning signs.
- Volatility regime: ATR helps you gauge current volatility levels and informs stop levels and position sizing. Higher ATR implies wider stops; lower ATR allows tighter stops.
- Volatility/variance perspective: Bollinger Middle (boll) gives a dynamic mean to compare price against a moving average with a sense of deviation, aiding breakout or mean-reversion judgments when used with other signals.

How to interpret and act (when data is available)
- Trend checks
  - If price is above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, and 50 SMA is above 200 SMA, the market is in an overall uptrend. Look for pullbacks toward the 50SMA or 200SMA as potential entries aligned with momentum signals.
  - If price is below both SMAs, and 50 SMA is below 200 SMA, treat rallies as potential selling pressure or bear-market tests; use additional momentum/volatility filters before entries.
- Momentum signals
  - MACD crossing above its signal line (and above zero) supports a bullish momentum tilt; crossing below supports bearish momentum. Confirm with RSI (e.g., RSI not in overbought territory when buying).
  - RSI over 70 suggests overbought risk; RSI below 30 suggests oversold risk. Look for RSI to reverse back toward the mean in a trend-confirming context rather than across-the-board reversals in a strong trend.
  - Use MACD/macd conjunction with price price-action relative to the 10 EMA (e.g., price above 10 EMA + MACD bullish cross) for entry timing.
- Volatility and stop sizing
  - ATR provides a baseline for stop placement. In volatile regimes (high ATR), widen stops; in calmer regimes, tighten stops.
  - Boll (Bollinger Middle) can be used to assess normal price drift around a mean. Breakouts above the upper band or below the lower band can signal strong moves, but verify with MACD/RSI and price-position relative to SMAs to avoid false breakouts.
- Entry/exit framework (illustrative)
  - Long setup: Price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD bullish cross, RSI rising but below 70, price near or above 10EMA, and price breaking above the Boll band or pulling back toward 50SMA/200SMA with a tight ATR-based stop.
  - Short setup: Price below 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD bearish cross, RSI weakening toward or below 30, price testing lower Boll band, with ATR indicating sufficient volatility to support a stop placement.

Important caveats
- All indicators have lag and can give false positives in choppy markets. Use at least 2–3 confirming indicators before acting.
- GOOG can experience regime shifts due to tech sector news, earnings, and macro factors. Always factor in earnings dates, macro releases, and sector health in your risk model.
- In this environment, I don’t yet have the actual indicator values for GOOG. Once data retrieval is successful, I can deliver a precise, data-driven trend report with concrete signals and actionable ideas.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now (start_date 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-11) or with a narrower window (e.g., last 12–18 months) to improve load reliability.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with the eight-indicator framework above and generate the real-time analysis as soon as the data tool is able to fetch GOOG data.

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and interpretation (reference for when data is loaded)

| Indicator | Category | What it measures / role | How to interpret signals | Suggested action (when confirmed) |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, support/resistance | Price above 50SMA = uptrend tendency; cross below = potential weakness | Favor entries in uptrend with pullbacks near 50SMA; use as a trend filter |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA = bullish bias; price below = bearish bias | Use for strategic trend confirmation; wait for alignment with other signals for entries |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price above 10EMA indicates bullish momentum; below indicates bearish momentum | Time entries with momentum confirmation from MACD/RSI and price action |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD line crossing above zero or above MACD Signal = bullish momentum; cross below = bearish momentum | Use with RSI and price relative to SMAs for entry timing |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD | MACD Signal cross with MACD line as trigger | Confirm with MACD and other momentum signals before trading |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength, overbought/oversold | RSI >70 = overbought risk; RSI <30 = oversold risk; watch for divergences | Use as a convexity filter; avoid entering purely based on RSI in strong trends |
| boll | Volatility Indicators | Bollinger Middle (20SMA) baseline | Price moving away from middle or breaking bands signals potential breakout/mean-reversion | Confirm with MACD/R RSI and price position relative to bands |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Average true range, volatility level | Higher ATR = wider stop and greater price swing; lower ATR = tighter stops | Set position sizes and stop distances accordingly; adapt risk per regime |

If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now or adjust the date window. Please tell me whether to:
- Retry get_YFin_data for GOOG with the same dates, or
- Try a shorter look-back (e.g., last 12–18 months) to improve success, or
- Proceed with the eight-indicator framework and produce a qualitative interpretation once data is available.
