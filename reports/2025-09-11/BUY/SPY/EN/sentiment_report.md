Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the latest Reddit/social sentiment data for SPY (as of 2025-09-11) but hit a tool error (FileNotFoundError) in the Reddit stock info fetch. I can retry the data pull right away, or proceed with a qualitative, data-driven framework using available sources other than Reddit until the tool is back up. Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here’s how I’ll proceed and what you can expect once I have the data.

What happened
- Tool issue: get_reddit_stock_info returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like an internal tool error rather than an issue with SPY data itself. I can retry now or on a schedule if you’d like.

Plan if you want me to proceed now (without waiting for the tool to come back)
- I’ll provide a trader-focused synthesis of SPY using:
  - Social sentiment framework (daily sentiment, notable themes, and top discussion drivers on social platforms) once I can fetch Reddit data.
  - Public news and macro developments from the past week (macro data, Fed commentary, geopolitical headlines, earnings influence from SPY’s top holdings) to explain movement.
  - Market structure context (key support/resistance levels, volume, breadth) and potential implications for SPY going into the next week.
  - Practical trading takeaways (scenarios, risk controls, and potential setups) tailored for ETF traders.

What I will deliver when the data is available
- A comprehensive long-form report detailing:
  - Daily sentiment snapshot for SPY over the past 7 days (positive/neutral/negative proportions, topic clusters, and sentiment momentum by day).
  - The top social themes driving sentiment (e.g., volatility expectations, sector rotation, inflation/interest-rate talk, liquidity concerns).
  - A synthesis of the most impactful news items from the last week (macro releases, policy commentary, earnings environment).
  - A concise risk/trigger map for SPY (key levels, potential catalysts, and what would shift the bias).
  - Trader-focused implications and actionable ideas (scalps, swing ideas, hedging considerations) with risk controls.
  - A Markdown table at the end that summarizes key points (sentiment trends, drivers, news items, levels, and recommended actions).

If you’d like, I can attempt a quick retry of the Reddit data pull right away and then deliver the full report in one go. Options:
- Retry now and proceed with the full, data-backed analysis.
- Proceed immediately with a qualitative framework (no Reddit data) and fill in the social sentiment piece later when the tool is available.
- Use an alternative data source you specify (e.g., another sentiment feed) if you have a preferred source.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and I’ll move forward accordingly.
