Recommendation: Buy SPY, but implement with a disciplined, phased entry and hedging as outlined in the plan.

Rationale (brief)
- Bull thesis alignment: The plan emphasizes a regime favorable to equities—potential rate relief, inflation normalization, and resilient broad-market earnings—supporting durable upside for SPY.
- SPY advantages: Liquidity, diversification, and low cost provide a robust core exposure, especially in a constructive macro regime.
- Risk management: The plan includes ATR-based stops, staged add-ons, and hedging sleeves to guard against regime shifts and drawdowns, reducing downside risk while participating in upside.

Implementation highlights (concise)
- Entry criteria (primary): Buy SPY when price trades above both 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA > 200SMA, a bullish MACD cross, RSI not overbought (below 70), and price above a rising Bollinger middle band with confirming volume.
- Secondary entry: If not triggered, look for a measured pullback toward the rising 50SMA with stabilization, MACD constructive, and volume confirmation.
- Sizing: Risk 1–2% of portfolio per tranche; cap total SPY exposure to a level aligned with your risk budget (e.g., 20–40% of equity, adjusted to mandate).
- Stops: ATR-based stops (1.5–2x ATR(14)) below latest swing low for each tranche, with stops moved up as the trend confirms.
- Hedging: Allocate 5–15% of SPY exposure to hedges (e.g., long SPY puts with 2–6 months to expiry or VIX-related hedges) to dampen drawdowns.
- Monitoring: Weekly review of price action and the 8-indicator framework, breadth, and macro inputs. If the framework deteriorates (e.g., 50SMA crossing below 200SMA, negative MACD, extreme or deteriorating breadth), reduce exposure or pause new buys; reassess hedges.
- Time horizon: 6–24 months for core exposure with periodic risk reviews.
- Regime plan: If inflation accelerates or policy remains restrictive, tighten risk and lean on hedges; if rates move toward cuts and earnings hold up, progressively increase core exposure.

Notes
- This is a disciplined, probabilistic approach rather than a chase of headlines. It uses a multi-signal framework to reduce whipsaws and includes hedges to protect against regime shocks.
- If you want, I can tailor exact entry levels, stop distances, and hedge instruments to your account size, leverage, tax situation, and available products.
