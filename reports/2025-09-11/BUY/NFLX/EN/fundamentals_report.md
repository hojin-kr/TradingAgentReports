Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull the latest NFLX fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) for 2025-09-11 using the available tools, but I’m seeing a FileNotFoundError from the data backend. In short, I can’t fetch the tool-based data right now. I can proceed in one of two ways:

Options
1) Retry and fetch the data now (if you want me to try again). I’ll re-run the same tool calls and report back with the insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement as soon as the data is accessible.

2) Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals report (no exact numbers from those tools). I’ll provide a thorough, trader-focused fundamentals analysis of NFLX’s business model, competitive position, profitability tendencies, cash flow quality, balance sheet risk, and potential catalysts/risks. I’ll clearly label where insights are qualitative due to the data pull issue and I can incorporate any numbers you share.

If you’d like me to proceed now with a qualitative analysis, I’ll cover:
- Company profile and business model
- Revenue drivers and profitability considerations (qualitative)
- Cash flow characteristics and capital expenditure implications
- Balance sheet health and liquidity risk (qualitative)
- Insider sentiment and insider trading implications (qualitative interpretation)
- Key risk factors and potential catalysts for the near term
- Trading implications and watchlist ideas
- A consolidated summary table (Markdown) at the end

Please choose option 1 to retry data pulls, or option 2 to proceed with a qualitative report. If you have any numbers you want me to analyze (even rough ones or figures you’ve seen elsewhere), feel free to share them and I’ll incorporate them precisely.
