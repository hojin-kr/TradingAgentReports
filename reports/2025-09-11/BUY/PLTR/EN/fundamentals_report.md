I attempted to pull the latest data for PLTR (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin financials) but the data fetch failed with FileNotFoundError from the tools. This looks like a temporary data-access issue on my side. I can retry immediately, or if you prefer, I can provide a qualitative overview based on publicly available information up to now and clearly note that the latest insider and quarterly financials are not yet fetched. Which would you like?

Option A: Retry data fetch now
- I’ll re-run the five data calls (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement) and then return a comprehensive, trader-focused fundamental report with a detailed Markdown table at the end.

Option B: Qualitative overview (no new data fetch)
- I’ll give a structured fundamentals-focused assessment for PLTR using known public context (business model, revenue mix, profitability trajectory, liquidity/financing, and risk factors) but without the latest insider data or the most recent quarterly figures. I’ll clearly flag where data is pending.

If you’d like me to proceed with the retry (Option A), I’ll run the data fetch again right away. If you’d prefer the quick qualitative view (Option B), I’ll provide that now with caveats about data freshness.

Would you like me to retry now or proceed with the qualitative overview?
