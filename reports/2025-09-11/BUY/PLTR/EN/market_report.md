Data retrieval issue
- I attempted to fetch PLTR price data with get_YFin_data for 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-11, but the service returned a FileNotFoundError. The subsequent stock stats indicator calls also failed for the same reason. This means I can’t extract live readings right now to generate an up-to-date, finely-tuned trend analysis for PLTR.

What I can still provide now
- A robust, non-redundant indicator plan you can use once data access is restored. I’ve selected 8 indicators that give complementary views (trend, momentum, volatility, and volume) without duplicating signals.

Recommended indicator set (8 total)
- macd: MACD
  - Rationale: Core momentum/trend signal; useful for spotting shifts in PLTR’s trend direction.
- macds: MACD Signal
  - Rationale: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD help confirm or filter MACD-based entries.
- close_50_sma: 50 SMA
  - Rationale: Medium-term trend backbone and dynamic support/resistance; helps gauge current regime.
- close_200_sma: 200 SMA
  - Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming major regime shifts (golden/death cross context).
- close_10_ema: 10 EMA
  - Rationale: Responsive short-term momentum; helps detect quicker shifts when used with longer averages.
- rsi: RSI
  - Rationale: Momentum gauge for overbought/oversold readings and potential reversals; useful for timing with trend context.
- atr: ATR
  - Rationale: Measures volatility; informs stop placement and position sizing under current market conditions.
- vwma: VWMA
  - Rationale: Volume-weighted perspective; helps confirm price action with volume, filtering false moves in thinly traded episodes.

How these indicators would be used together for PLTR
- Trend confirmation
  - Use crossovers/trends in macd and macds to identify shifts in PLTR’s momentum.
  - Confirm with price position relative to the 50 SMA and 200 SMA: price above both suggests a bullish regime; price below both suggests bearish or choppy conditions. Watch for confluence with MACD signals.
- Momentum and timing
  - When macd/macds indicate a bullish setup, check RSI to ensure momentum isn’t overbought (RSI near or above 70 could warn of a potential pullback, especially if price is stretched and approaching resistance).
  - If RSI is near oversold, a rising MACD signal may point to a potential entry in a recovering downtrend or consolidating base.
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR informs how wide protective stops should be and how position sizes should adapt to current volatility.
- Volume-confirmed moves
  - VWMA helps verify that moves in PLTR price are supported by volume, reducing the likelihood of false breakouts in low-liquidity periods.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data fetching and indicator calculations as soon as the data service is accessible again. If you want, I can also adjust the date range or target a specific intraday/daily timeframe to fit your trading style.
- If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a more qualitative framework (human-assisted interpretation) using historical context of PLTR once data access is restored, and then provide an exact, live-read indicator synthesis.

Key points table (Markdown)
- I’ve organized the eight indicators with their purpose and how they help analyze PLTR.

| Indicator | Category | What it Measures / Why it Matters for PLTR | How to Use for Signals (PLTR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum/trend direction via EMA differences | Look for MACD line crossing above/below the signal for entry/exit; corroborate with price action above/below major moving averages |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal smoothing; confirms/macross with MACD | Use crossovers with MACD to validate signals and reduce false positives; combine with RSI for overbought/oversold context |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend base; dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests bullish tone; price below reinforces bearish or consolidation risk; watch for crossovers |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark; regime indicators | Price above 200SMA indicates long-term bullish bias; price below suggests long-term caution; look for golden/death cross signals around these levels |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; responsive to shifts | Use with 50SMA/200SMA to time entries; be cautious in choppy markets due to noise |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold; momentum strength | RSI near extremes signals potential reversals; confirm with MACD and price position relative to key SMAs |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility; risk management guide | Higher ATR -> wider stops; adjust position sizing accordingly; monitor changes for risk control |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Price action confirmed by volume | Signals that moves are supported by volume; helps filter out moves in low liquidity or during volume spikes |

Notes
- I couldn’t fetch live PLTR data in this session due to environment issues. Once the data service is back, I’ll run these 8 indicators on PLTR’s price series (and the requested date range or your preferred window) and provide a detailed, data-backed trend synthesis with specific signals and potential trade setups.

Would you like me to retry data retrieval now, or should I proceed with any preference for the time window or timeframe (daily vs. intraday) once data access is restored?
