I ran into an issue with the Reddit data tool (FileNotFoundError). I can either retry the fetch now or proceed with a structured plan and fill in the Reddit sentiment later once the data call works. Which would you prefer?

Option A — Retry now
- I’ll attempt one more time to fetch the PLTR Reddit stock info for 2025-09-11 and then build the full long report with day-by-day sentiment, plus the latest company news.

Option B — Structured plan (no tool data yet)
- I’ll deliver a comprehensive framework and an in-depth analysis workflow you can use, plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table at the end. Once the tool returns data, I’ll populate the sentiment figures and news specifics.

If you’re ready for Option A, I’ll retry immediately and proceed with the full report once the data comes back. If you’d rather proceed with Option B now, here’s the plan I’ll follow (and I can start immediately):

What I’ll cover in the long report (PLTR, last 7 days)
- Executive snapshot
  - Core narrative: why traders talk about PLTR today (growth trajectory, AI/Foundry leverage, monetization of commercial verticals, etc.)
  - Price action context (recent move, volatility, key levels to watch)
- Social sentiment deep-dive
  - Day-by-day sentiment shifts on Reddit and other major social channels
  - Thematic clusters driving sentiment (e.g., AI capabilities, government contracts, product updates, earnings expectations, leadership comments)
  - Notable outliers or influential posts (large upvotes, highly engaged posts)
- News and event synthesis
  - Summary of relevant company announcements, partnerships, product launches, or guidance changes
  - Potential catalysts or headwinds (contract wins, competitive dynamics, regulatory developments)
- Thematic analysis
  - Demand drivers: government demand, commercial adoption, Foundry ecosystem expansion
  - Margin and profitability trajectory: cost discipline, headcount, R&D intensity, mix shift
  - Competitive landscape: how PLTR stacks against peers (data analytics platforms, AI-enabled verticals)
  - Risk factors: customer concentration, procurement cycles, policy shifts, macro headwinds
- Sentiment-to-action mapping for traders
  - Short-term catalysts and mispricings to watch
  - Situations where sentiment diverges from fundamentals and how to trade (e.g., sentiment-driven pullbacks vs. long-term value inflections)
- Cross-check with broader market backdrop
  - Sector sentiment, tech/AI fatigue, risk-on vs risk-off environments
  - Correlations with AI stock indices or related names
- Practical implications for traders
  - Key levels, volume signals, options activity cues
  - Potential entry/exit scenarios under different sentiment trajectories
- Risk controls and caveats
  - Data quality considerations, possible biases in social data
  - Limitations of sentiment as a predictive signal

Format: I’ll present a comprehensive narrative, bullet-pointed insights, and a concise risk/optionality section, followed by a Markdown table organizing key points.

Markdown table (to be appended at the end)
- I’ll populate columns like: Topic, Sentiment Driver, Time Window, Key Insight, Potential Trade Implication, Confidence (Low/Med/High), Data Source (Reddit/News/Social)
- Rows will cover major themes (AI/Foundry growth, government/commercial mix, product updates, earnings expectations, regulatory dynamics, etc.)

If you want me to proceed right away with Option B (the plan), say “Proceed with the plan,” and I’ll start delivering the structured report now. If you prefer Option A, I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch and then deliver the full long report as soon as I have the data.
