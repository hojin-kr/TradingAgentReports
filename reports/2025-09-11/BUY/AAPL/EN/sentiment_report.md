I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock sentiment data for AAPL on 2025-09-11, but the data tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can’t access the Reddit feed right now to build the full, day-by-day sentiment plot and news integration.

Here are the best options to proceed:

- Option 1: Retry data fetch now or in the next message
  - I’ll re-run the Reddit data pull for AAPL for 2025-09-11 and then compile the full long-form report with sentiment by day, key posts, and cross-check with recent company news.

- Option 2: Use an alternative data source
  - If you have any other data sources you want me to include (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, StockTwits, official Apple press releases, earnings notes, or a pasted dataset), I can integrate those and still deliver a thorough report.

- Option 3: Proceed with a best-effort framework now
  - I can draft the complete long report structure, including an in-depth analysis plan, what signals to watch, and a Markdown table at the end, and then fill in the real data once the Reddit tool is available again.

What I’d deliver in the full report (once data comes through):
- A week-long sentiment breakdown for AAPL on social media (Reddit) with daily sentiment polarity, volume, and notable sentiment drivers.
- A synthesis of recent Apple news (product updates, services growth, supply chain, regulatory, AI/AR news, earnings context) and how it interacts with sentiment.
- Trader-focused insights:
  - How sentiment momentum aligns or diverges from price action, implied volatility, and macro factors.
  - Specific catalysts to watch (e.g., product launches, earnings cadence, regulatory actions, competitor activity).
  - Risk factors and hedging ideas tied to sentiment hot spots.
- A clear set of takeaways and a "watch/unwatch" list for the next 1–2 weeks.
- A final Markdown table aggregating key points (sentiment signal, news drivers, price/volatility context, suggested action).

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry the Reddit data now (I’ll attempt another fetch immediately),
- Use an alternative data source you specify,
- Or proceed with the framework now and fill in the data as soon as the tool is back up.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option 1 right away, I’ll retry the Reddit data pull for AAPL on 2025-09-11 and then deliver the full report with the Markdown table.
