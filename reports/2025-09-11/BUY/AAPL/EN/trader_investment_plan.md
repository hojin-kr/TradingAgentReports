Recommendation summary
- Buy with disciplined, staged entry and robust risk controls. This approach aligns with the plan’s core logic: durable cash flow, Services/AI monetization potential, and a defensive margin cushion from partnerships and diversification.

Rationale (condensed)
- Durable upside thesis: Apple’s transition to a Services/AI-enabled ecosystem supports multi-year growth beyond hardware cycles, with cross-device monetization and higher Services mix driving ASP uplift.
- Margin and risk cushions: The Google deal provides margin stability; international diversification reduces China exposure; a strong balance sheet underpins downside protection.
- Risk-aware timing: While valuation concerns exist, the plan emphasizes tangible monetization milestones rather than hype, with staged exposure to capitalize on confirmatory signals.

Positioning and entry plan
- Stage into over 2–3 tranches:
  - Tranche 1: 40% of targeted long position now.
  - Tranche 2: 30% on a pullback or weak data signal (e.g., modest miss or soft Services metrics).
  - Tranche 3: 30% on confirmation of AI monetization milestones or sustained Services/ASP uplift (e.g., multi-quarter momentum).
- Size and risk budget: cap initial exposure so a 1–2% portfolio drawdown would not trigger forced liquidation; overall sleeve risk capped at 2–3% of the portfolio.

Risk controls and hedging
- Protective hedges: buy protective puts (OTM, 5–10% below current price) or implement a collar (long stock, short near-term calls funded by higher-strike calls and long puts) to cap downside while preserving upside participation.
- Stop-loss discipline: use a trailing stop (e.g., 1.5x ATR) or a move below the 50-day moving average as a trigger to reassess or reduce risk.
- Dynamic sizing: adjust tranche sizes if volatility spikes or if macro/regulatory headlines increase risk sentiment.

Catalysts and data-tracking plan
- Key signals to monitor: visible Services growth materializing, ASP uplift, cross-device engagement metrics, and concrete monetization milestones from AI initiatives.
- Technical triggers: sustained price action above 50/200-day moving averages, bullish momentum (e.g., MACD positive cross), and RSI not signaling overbought extremes for extended periods.
- Data cadence: reassess every 6–12 weeks around earnings, product-cycle updates, and regulatory news. If signals deteriorate, tighten hedges or reduce exposure.

Price targets and exit plan
- Long-horizon target range: mid-to-high 200s up toward low 300s if AI monetization accelerates and Services lift persists.
- Downside guardrails: if momentum deteriorates (bearish MACD, break of key trend supports, or persistent weakness in Services/ASP metrics), trim exposure or exit the position partially.
- Exit rules: switch to a risk-parity stance if critical technical supports break or if data fail to show durable monetization progress after a defined window (e.g., 2–3 quarters).

Review cadence
- Quarterly review anchored to earnings and product updates, with readiness to adjust hedges and tranche timing based on data and macro conditions.

Applied learning and safeguards
- Emphasizes validation of monetization progress over AI hype, uses data-driven triggers, and maintains hedges to protect capital while retaining upside potential.
