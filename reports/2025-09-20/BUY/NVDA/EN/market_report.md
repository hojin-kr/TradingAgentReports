I attempted to fetch NVDA data but the data retrieval step failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the data source. I can retry fetching the CSV data, try a different date range, or proceed with a purely indicator-focused plan that you can execute once data access is restored. For now, I’ll proceed with selecting a cohesive set of indicators and explain how they would be interpreted for NVDA in a current-market context.

Selected indicators (8 total) with rationale for NVDA
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - What it measures: mid-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
  - NVDA context: NVDA often trades with strong uptrends around AI demand cycles; 50SMA helps confirm the medium-term trend direction and potential pullback levels.
  - Role: Trend confirmation and pullback filtering when used with faster signals.

- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - What it measures: long-term trend benchmark.
  - NVDA context: Long cycles in technology/AI markets can push price above/below the 200SMA, signaling broader regime changes (golden/death cross potential).
  - Role: Strategic trend confirmation and macro-context view.

- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  - What it measures: short-term momentum and quicker trend shifts.
  - NVDA context: In a high-volatility stock like NVDA, the 10-EMA can capture rapid momentum shifts around earnings, AI news, or supply/demand news.
  - Role: Timely entry/exit perspective when used with longer-term averages for filtering.

- macd (MACD line)
  - What it measures: momentum via difference of two EMAs (traditionally 12-26-9 settings in many systems).
  - NVDA context: MACD crossovers help identify momentum changes in a stock known for rapid moves; divergence against price can warn of exhaustion or continuation.
  - Role: Core momentum signal to pair with trend filters.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: the EMA smoothing of MACD; cross with MACD line triggers signals.
  - NVDA context: Confirm signal reliability; helps reduce false positives in fast-moving markets.
  - Role: Trade-entry trigger when MACD line crosses its signal line, especially when aligned with price/volume cues.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: momentum strength via the gap between MACD and its signal.
  - NVDA context: Divergence in histogram height can foreshadow shifts in momentum before price completes a reversal.
  - Role: Early momentum-read that complements MACD cross signals.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions (typically with 70/30 thresholds).
  - NVDA context: In strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; use in conjunction with trend direction to avoid premature exits.
  - Role: Overbought/oversold context and potential reversal warning when paired with MACD/price action.

- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it measures: volatility level and range of price movement.
  - NVDA context: NVDA often experiences periods of elevated volatility around earnings or AI news; ATR helps position sizing and stop placement amid burst moves.
  - Role: Risk management and position-sizing anchor, not a directional signal.

What to watch when these indicators come together (nuanced interpretation approach)
- Trend alignment: Look for alignment between close_50_sma and close_200_sma (e.g., price above both with 50SMA above 200SMA) to confirm a bullish regime. If the price sits between them or crosses below, treat signals with added caution.
- Short-term momentum vs. medium-term trend: A bullish MACD/macd hist positive signal that coincides with price above 50SMA and 200SMA strengthens conviction for a continuation move. If MACD is negative while price holds above 50SMA, look for a potential consolidation or pullback scenario.
- Entry/exit timing: Use close_10_ema as a quick momentum filter. A recent cross of price above the 10-EMA in the context of a bullish MACD and RSI not yet in overbought territory can signal a higher-probability short-term entry, provided ATR is not spiking too high (risk controls in place).
- Momentum vs. volatility: RSI provides momentum extremes, but NVDA can remain overbought in strong uptrends; combine RSI with MACD/histogram trends to avoid overreliance on overbought signals. ATR will help judge stop levels when volatility expands.
- Risk management: Use ATR to set dynamic stop distances and adapt position sizing during periods of rising volatility (e.g., after earnings or major AI announcements). This helps manage risk in NVDA's typical big-move environments.
- Divergence checks: Monitor MACD histogram divergence vs. price highs/lows for potential reversals aligned with RSI readings to catch early warnings before price reverses.

Notes on data access
- I currently don’t have a successful data fetch for NVDA due to the FileNotFoundError encountered in the data source. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry fetching the CSV data (e.g., different date range or after a short delay).
  - Proceed with the indicator plan and generate the analysis once data access is restored.
  - Run the indicators against an alternative data source if available.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now (potentially with a different date range), or proceed with this indicator suite and a structured interpretation framework that you can apply as soon as data access is restored? If you prefer, I can also include a plan to integrate VWMA in a follow-up step once we confirm data availability.
