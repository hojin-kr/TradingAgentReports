Recommendation: Buy NVDA, but with a disciplined, staged, risk-managed approach.

Rationale (why now)
- The plan builds on a durable multi-year AI data-center tailwind and a CUDA/software moat that supports durable margins and optionality beyond hardware.
- Near-term catalysts (regional AI funding, ecosystem expansions, and ongoing demand) provide upside potential, while bear risks (China/regulatory headwinds, valuation, and competitive threats) are real but manageable with hedges and staged entry.
- The equity offers upside optionality through software monetization, edge/adoption opportunities, and potential multiple expansion if visibility improves; this aligns with a core “buy with overlays” approach rather than naked allocation.

Positioning and sizing (how to implement)
- Core exposure: start with a modest core allocation within your equity sleeve (2–5% of total risk budget). Use a staged-entry approach rather than a full, immediate build.
- Scaling into exposure: add in increments only after confirming technical confirmation signals and favorable risk metrics (see entry triggers).

Entry triggers (technical and risk-based)
- Primary entry signal: price trades above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, MACD shows a bullish cross with expanding histogram, and RSI in a constructive zone (not overbought).
- Alternative entry signal: if price pulls back to a defined support zone (prior swing low or multi-month support) and then reclaims momentum signals, layer in additional exposure.
- If price action remains trend-positive but momentum indicators become stretched, consider a slower drip-in while maintaining strict risk controls.

Risk management and hedging
- Stop framework: use ATR-based stops (e.g., a multiple of the 14-day ATR below entry) to accommodate volatility, with a potential trailing stop to lock in gains as momentum persists.
- Defined-risk overlays: consider protective puts or a short-duration put spread around earnings or major headlines to limit downside without capping upside.
- Options overlays for upside with limited risk: small allocation to longer-dated calls (LEAPs) or a modest bullish call spread to participate in upside with defined downside exposure. Size these positions conservatively relative to the core NVDA allocation.
- Earnings/catalyst risk: reduce net exposure or implement hedges ahead of earnings and regulatory events to guard against surprises.

Catalyst monitoring plan
- Watch for: China regulatory developments, export controls, regional AI funding announcements, Intel collaboration milestones, and hyperscaler capex updates.
- If catalysts stay constructive: progressively add to the position toward the target exposure, guided by price action and risk metrics.
- If regulators tilt negative: lean toward hedges and consider trimming exposure to protect capital while preserving potential upside.

Monitoring cadence and evaluation
- Weekly cadence: assess price action relative to moving averages, momentum (MACD, RSI), and volatility (ATR). Track policy/regulatory headlines and major company catalysts.
- Rebalance: quarterly, or sooner if a material catalyst shifts risk/reward (guidance changes, competitive developments, or regulatory rulings).

Contingency plan
- If a meaningful slowdown in hyperscaler capex or intensified China risk emerges: tighten risk controls, reduce net exposure, and deploy hedging to preserve capital.
- If results and demand signals are robust with margin stabilization: consider incremental exposure and adjust option positioning to capture further upside.

Lessons reflected (apply prudent guardrails)
- Avoid relying on a single signal; require multi-indicator confirmation before adding exposure.
- Don’t chase headlines; use hedges and defined-risk strategies to manage volatility around catalysts.
- Build the position to scale with payoff potential: staged entry, defined risk, and optionality.

Bottom line
- The most defensible course is to buy with a disciplined, staged approach and risk overlays to participate in the long-term AI infrastructure thesis while safeguarding against near-term volatility and regulatory/headline risk.

If you’d like, I can tailor precise entry price targets, stop levels, and specific option strike/date ideas aligned to your 6–12 month horizon and risk tolerance (conservative, balanced, or aggressive).
