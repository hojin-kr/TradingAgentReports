I ran into an internal tool error trying to fetch Reddit stock news for NVDA (FileNotFoundError). I can retry, but since the tool isn’t responding right now, I should propose a fallback plan so we can keep moving.

Options:
1) Retry the Reddit feed now
- I can attempt another call to get_reddit_stock_info for NVDA on 2025-09-20 and proceed with the long-form report once it returns data.

2) Proceed with an alternative data approach (no Reddit feed)
- I can produce a comprehensive NVDA sentiment/news analysis using publicly available sources beyond Reddit (e.g., mainstream press coverage, earnings notes, social sentiment proxies) for the past week up to 2025-09-20.
- I’ll clearly annotate sources and approach, and provide traders-focused insights, risks, and a Markdown summary table at the end.

3) Hybrid approach
- I fetch whatever Reddit data can be retrieved (if/when the tool comes back), and supplement with other sources where Reddit data is missing or sparse.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like me to proceed immediately with option 2 (no Reddit feed), I’ll start compiling a detailed NVDA sentiment/news analysis for the past week, focusing on:
- Daily sentiment trends (positive/negative/neutral)
- Key social sentiment drivers (AI demand, supply chain, GPU pricing, RTX/AI product news, competition)
- Recent company news (earnings, product announcements, partnerships, regulatory or geopolitical factors)
- Implications for traders (volatility, support/resistance levels, risk factors, catalysts)
- A clear, reader-friendly Markdown table summarizing key points

If you prefer I try the Reddit feed again first, I’ll do that and integrate it into the same report.
