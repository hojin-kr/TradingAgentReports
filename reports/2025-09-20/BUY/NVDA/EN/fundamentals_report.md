I attempted to pull NVDA’s fundamentals for 2025-09-20 using the integrated data tools, but the backend returned FileNotFoundError for all requested data sources. This prevents me from delivering the full, data-filled report right now.

What happened and next steps
- Issue: FileNotFoundError (backend/data source layer) across all tools I tried (FinnHub insider sentiment/transactions, SimFin balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement).
- Possible causes: temporary outage or misconfiguration in the data service, missing data files for the requested date, or credentials/access issues on the SimFin/FinnHub endpoints.
- Options:
  1) Retry now or after a short wait to see if the backend recovers.
  2) Proceed with a qualitative framework and a detailed report template you can fill once data comes back.
  3) If you have alternative data sources you want me to use, I can integrate those (if supported).

If you’d like, I can proceed with one of these approaches:
- Option A: Retry now and attempt to fetch all data again, then produce the full report with exact figures.
- Option B: Generate a comprehensive, trader-focused fundamental report framework now (with clear sections, key metrics to watch, and interpretation guidelines), plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table for when data is available.
- Option C: Provide a qualitative NVDA fundamentals analysis based on publicly known context up to 2024 (with explicit caveats about data recency) and outline what to watch in 2025–2026.

If you prefer Option B (framework now), here is a complete report structure you can expect, plus a Markdown table template at the end. You can paste in actual figures once the data tools are functioning again.

Would you like me to:
- Retry the data pulls now and proceed with a full data-driven NVDA fundamental report once the backend responds, or
- Provide the complete qualitative framework now and populate the table once data is available, or
- Proceed with Option C and give you a qualitative NVDA fundamentals overview based on prior knowledge up to 2024, clearly labeled as not reflecting 2025-09-20 data?

If you prefer, tell me which option (A, B, or C) you want, and I’ll execute accordingly.
