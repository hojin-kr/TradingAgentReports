Apologies — I attempted to fetch data for QQQ and run the requested indicators, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError (environment issue). I can proceed with a solid indicator setup and a detailed plan for you, and re-run the data fetch as soon as the data source is accessible. In the meantime, here is a focused, well-rounded indicator suite tailored for QQQ (Nasdaq-100) and why each is useful, along with implementation guidance.

Selected indicators (up to 8) for QQQ
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Why these 8 indicators are complementary for QQQ
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Purpose: Captures the medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Suitability for QQQ: Tech-focused, high-beta ETF that often trades with persistent trends; the 50-day average helps filter short-term noise while aligning with broader tech momentum.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and potential signal for major regime shifts (golden/death cross contexts).
  - Suitability for QQQ: Useful for framing macro tilt (e.g., growth rotations, policy-driven tech cycles) and to confirm the overall market environment (bullish/bearish longer-term tone).
- macd (MACD line)
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend change signals via EMA differences; helps spot crossovers and divergences.
  - Suitability for QQQ: Tech equities often exhibit clear momentum bursts; MACD helps identify turning points in fast-moving tech-led rallies or pullbacks.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Purpose: Smoothing-based confirmation of MACD signals; crossovers with MACD line generate actionable entries/exits.
  - Suitability for QQQ: Adds reliability to MACD decisions, reducing false signals in ranges or choppy periods.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Purpose: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence between MACD and its signal.
  - Suitability for QQQ: Quickly flags accelerating or waning momentum around key price levels, useful for timing entries in tech-heavy markets.
- rsi (RSI)
  - Purpose: Momentum gauge highlighting overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences.
  - Suitability for QQQ: In strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated; use in conjunction with trend context (50/200 SMA and VWMA) to avoid overreaction to overbought readings.
- atr (ATR)
  - Purpose: Measures volatility, aiding stop placement and position sizing.
  - Suitability for QQQ: Tech markets can swing aggressively; ATR helps calibrate risk management and adapt stops to current volatility regimes.
- vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
  - Purpose: Trend confirmation that blends price with volume, filtering out low-volume moves.
  - Suitability for QQQ: Volume-driven moves are common in tech announcements and earnings; VWMA helps distinguish genuine trend moves from low-volume noise.

How to interpret signals with these indicators (high-level guidance)
- Trend confirmation
  - If price is above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma, and price is above VWMA, it suggests a constructive tech-sector trend.
  - If price is below both SMAs and VWMA, it implies a bearish backdrop; look for momentum and volatility to confirm trend re-entry or continuation.
- Momentum and entry/exit cues
  - MACD line crossing above MACD Signal (and growing histogram) supports bullish entries when aligned with the trend context.
  - MACD divergence (price higher, MACD lower) warns of potential pullbacks; confirm with RSI and ATR to gauge momentum vs. volatility.
- Overbought/oversold context
  - RSI approaching overbought territory can be a warning within an uptrend; look for MACD/wVine (VWMA) alignment or a pullback in price to enter on a reversion to the mean.
  - RSI moving toward oversold in a downtrend can signal potential relief rallies; confirm with MACD and ATR to avoid false positives in a strong bear regime.
- Volatility considerations
  - ATR rising indicates expanding volatility; adjust position sizing and stops accordingly.
  - When ATR contracts while price remains trend-following (per VWMA and SMAs), it may indicate a consolidation that could precede a breakout or trend pause.
- Volume confirmation
  - A move confirmed by VWMA with rising volume strengthens the validity of a breakout or trend continuation, particularly around earnings, product launches, or policy shifts impacting tech.

Actionable signals workflow (practical steps)
1) Establish trend context: Check price relative to close_50_sma, close_200_sma, and VWMA.
2) Confirm momentum: Look for MACD line crossing above/below MACD Signal and positive/negative MACD Histogram trend.
3) Cross-check with RSI: Confirm momentum with RSI in the context of the trend (avoid chasing in overbought in strong uptrends; seek RSI confirmations/divergences in pullbacks).
4) Factor volatility: Monitor ATR for adapting risk (adjust stops and position size as ATR expands/contracts).
5) Validate with volume: Ensure price moves are supported by VWMA-related volume patterns.
6) Execute with risk controls: Use ATR-informed stops; adjust targets using the combination of trend strength (SMAs) and momentum (MACD) signals.
7) Re-evaluate periodically: In fast-moving markets, re-check signals as new price action occurs (intraday to daily).
8) Avoid overfitting: If indicators conflict, prioritize the trend signal (SMAs and VWMA) and use MACD/RSI as secondary filters.

Next steps to obtain the actual data for QQQ
- I will retry pulling the data with get_YFin_data for QQQ from 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-20 and re-run the 8 indicators. If the environment continues to error, I can:
  - Try a shortened window (e.g., 180 days) to see if the system handles smaller datasets.
  - Attempt a different curr_date (e.g., 2025-09-19) to check date-specific issues.
  - Move to a cached or alternative data source if available.

Please let me know if you’d like me to attempt the data fetch again now, or if you prefer I proceed with a more conservative qualitative assessment using the 8-indicator framework described above (useful for planning while we resolve the data issue).

Markdown summary table
- Indicators and rationale for QQQ

| Indicator | Category | Rationale for QQQ | How to use (quick guide) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance; filters noise | Check price above/below 50SMA to gauge trend direction; use with VWMA for confirmation |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark; regime context | Price above 200SMA suggests bullish longer-term tilt; below indicates bearish bias; use for trend confirmation |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum/trend change signals; crossovers/divergence | Buy when MACD line crosses above Signal with positive histogram; confirm with price above SMAs |
| macds | MACD Related | Smoothing-confirmation of MACD signals | Use MACD Signal cross with MACD line as confirmation; reduces false positives |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength; divergence visualization | Monitor histogram for accelerating/decelerating momentum; confirm with price action |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold context; divergence signals | Look for trend-consistent readings (e.g., not overreacting to RSI in strong uptrends); use divergences for reversals |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Risk management; stop-placement; position sizing | Use ATR to size stops and adjust risk as volatility changes; higher ATR implies wider stops |
| vwma | Volume-Based Indicators | Volume-filtered trend confirmation | Confirm trends with volume: rising VWMA + price above VWMA strengthens signal; watch for volume spikes around breakouts |
