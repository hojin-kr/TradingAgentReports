Sorry — I ran into a tool error while pulling Reddit data for QQQ on 2025-09-20. The Reddit data fetch returned a FileNotFoundError, which means the data backend is temporarily unavailable or misconfigured. I can retry the fetch, or switch to alternative data sources (e.g., other social sentiment streams or general news) to continue the analysis.

How would you like to proceed?
- Retry Reddit data fetch for QQQ (same date, 2025-09-20)
- Use alternative data sources (e.g., other social platforms, latest news articles, ETF/stock flow data) to build the analysis
- Proceed with a high-level, data-agnostic long-form briefing on QQQ (ETF) and its near-term drivers, with a plan to insert Reddit sentiment once the tool is back

If you’d like me to proceed now with an alternative path, here’s a draft outline of the long-form report I would produce once data is available. I’ll fill in data points and sentiment metrics as soon as I can access them.

Draft outline (what I will cover once data is fetched)
- Executive snapshot
  - Summary verdict on near-term sentiment and risk for QQQ
  - Key catalysts (earnings season, AI demand trends, rate expectations, regulatory updates)

Please tell me which path you prefer (retry Reddit, switch sources, or proceed with the data-agnostic outline). If you want me to retry right now, I’ll initiate another fetch for QQQ on 2025-09-20 and return with a consolidated, trader-focused report as soon as the data comes in.
