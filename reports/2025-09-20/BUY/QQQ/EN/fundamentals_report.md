Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch data in parallel for QQQ, but I hit a FileNotFoundError. The root issue is that QQQ is an ETF (tracks the NASDAQ-100), not a single company. The tools available (Finnhub insider sentiment/transactions and SimFin income statement/balance sheet/cash flow) are designed for individual, non-ETF companies. They won’t yield meaningful company-level fundamentals for an ETF like QQQ.

Here are the practical options going forward:

Option A – Analyze a constituent (company) instead
- Provide a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOG, META) and I’ll generate a comprehensive fundamental report using the available tools:
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Most recent quarterly balance sheet
  - Most recent quarterly income statement
  - Most recent quarterly cash flow statement
- I’ll include a detailed, trader-focused analysis and a final Markdown table of key points.

Option B – ETF-focused overview of QQQ
- I can deliver a qualitative, trader-oriented fundamental report on QQQ as an ETF, including:
  - Fund objective and tracking methodology ( NASDAQ-100 )
  - Expense ratio, liquidity, and typical bid-ask behavior
  - Top holdings and approximate concentration/sector exposure (e.g., tech tilt)
  - Historical performance context vs. broad market and NASDAQ-100 index (qualitative, not price-based)
  - Risks and considerations for trading/holding (concentration risk, volatility, macro sensitivity)
  - Tax considerations and distribution profile (if relevant)
- Note: I won’t have precise, up-to-date weights or holdings without a live ETF data feed, but I can present a thorough qualitative framework and what to watch for.

Option C – Use a different ticker you specify
- If you want data gathered precisely from the stated tools, I can pull for a different company ticker you choose.

Please tell me which option you prefer (A, B, or C), and if you want Option A, provide the specific company ticker and the desired data cadence (e.g., quarterly or annual) and date. If you want Option B, I can proceed with a detailed ETF-focused report right away.
