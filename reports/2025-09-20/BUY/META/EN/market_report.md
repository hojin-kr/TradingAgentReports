Thanks for the request. I attempted to fetch META data to generate the indicator analysis, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like an environment issue rather than a data problem. I can retry automatically or proceed with a clear plan and the indicator selection now, and then run the full analysis once the data pull succeeds. Please tell me if you want me to retry immediately.

In the meantime, here is a focused, non-redundant indicator plan for META (8 indicators) with rationale tailored to a large-cap tech name like META in a typical post-2024 market context:

Selected indicators (up to 8, chosen for complementary insights)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Rationale and how they complement META’s context
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it provides: A medium-term trend view and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: If price is above 50SMA and 50SMA sits above 200SMA, it supports a constructive trend bias. Look for pullbacks to the 50SMA as potential entry zones in an uptrend.
  - Why META: META often exhibits persistent trend scaffolding around the 50-day area during sustained rallies or corrections; it helps filter entries in the broader trend.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it provides: A long-term trend benchmark and a proxy for macro-trend integrity.
  - How to use: Price above 200SMA is a bullish backdrop; cross of price above/below 200SMA can signal longer-term regime shifts (golden/death cross dynamics when used with other signals).
  - Why META: For a mega-cap name, aligning with the long-term trend is critical given big moves can be driven by fundamental shifts and sector momentum.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it provides: A responsive short-term momentum signal.
  - How to use: Price crossing above/below the 10EMA can signal quick momentum shifts; use alongside 50SMA/200SMA to filter noise.
  - Why META: Helps catch quicker swing entries in a volatile tech stock where rapid news cycles can drive momentum.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it provides: Momentum via the difference between two EMAs; helps identify trend changes.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossovers with the signal line and divergence with price to anticipate trend changes.
  - Why META: MACD is a robust companion to price-based trend lines in tech names where momentum shifts can precede trend reversals.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it provides: The smoothed MACD component that provides a cross-confirmation signal with MACD.
  - How to use: Use MACD vs. MACDS crossovers as trading triggers; pair with price action to reduce false signals.
  - Why META: Adds a smoothing layer to momentum signals, improving reliability in choppy or sideways phases.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it provides: Momentum strength and divergence cues via the gap between MACD and its signal.
  - How to use: Rising histogram strengthens a momentum move; negative/waning bars can warn of weakening momentum or potential reversals.
  - Why META: Divergences between price and MACD histogram can flag hidden tops/bottoms in large-cap tech during volatility spikes.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it provides: Relative strength momentum and overbought/oversold context.
  - How to use: Watch for overbought (≥70) or oversold (≤30) readings, plus divergences with price. In strong trends, RSI can stay extended, so use with other trend indicators.
  - Why META: RSI helps gauge momentum extremes during big moves and can alert to potential pullbacks or reversals when price trends are extended.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it provides: Volatility level to gauge market noise and position sizing risks.
  - How to use: Use ATR to set dynamic stop distances and adjust position sizes according to current volatility.
  - Why META: META often experiences volatility spikes tied to earnings/news, making ATR a practical risk-management tool.

Next steps and how I’ll proceed once data is available
- I will retry fetching META data (2024-09-20 to 2025-09-20).
- Once data is retrieved, I will compute the 8 indicators above (using the exact indicator definitions you requested) and generate a detailed, nuanced trend report with:
  - Trend assessment across short, medium, and long horizons
  - Momentum and momentum-change analysis
  - Volatility and risk management considerations
  - Concrete bullish/bearish signal conjunctions and potential entry/exit ideas
  - A clear mark-up of any potential golden/death cross scenarios and RSI/MACD divergences
- I will append a Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points (indicators, what they measure, and how to use them for META).

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now? If you prefer, I can proceed with a simulated or placeholder run to illustrate the final report structure, but I’ll clearly label it as a placeholder and will replace it with real data as soon as the fetch succeeds.

Markdown table: indicators at a glance (ready to populate with real data)
- Indicator | Category | What it measures for META | How to use for decision
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | 50-day trend, dynamic support/resistance | Confirm trend direction; look for pullbacks to 50SMA as entries if above 200SMA
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | 200-day trend, long-term benchmark | Price above suggests bullish regime; watch for cross signals around 200SMA
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick momentum shifts; use with longer averages to filter noise
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum swing via EMA differences | Bullish/bearish cross with Signal line; trend-change indicator
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line smoothing | Cross with MACD line provides confirmation
- macdh | MACD Related | MACD histogram momentum strength | Rising/falling histogram signals momentum changes/divergence
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | Use 70/30 thresholds and divergences with price
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility level | Set stops and size positions using current volatility

If you want me to proceed with the retry automatically, say “retry now,” and I’ll kick off another fetch attempt and then generate the full, detailed trend report as soon as data is available.
