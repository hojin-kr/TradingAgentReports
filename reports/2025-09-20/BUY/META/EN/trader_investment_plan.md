Summary recommendation
- Buy META with a disciplined, phased entry and explicit risk controls. Do not chase; use defined pullbacks and hedges to manage near-term volatility while maintaining upside exposure to multi-vector monetization (ads, Reels, shopping, AI licensing, and optional hardware upside).

How to implement (practical execution)
- Positioning
  - Core exposure: target a 4–6% position of your portfolio as the starting core.
  - Entry sequencing (two-tranche approach):
    - Tranche 1: enter around the low-to-mid $700s, provided META remains in a constructive uptrend and above key trendlines (e.g., price above the 50-day SMA and ideally near the 200-day SMA supporting base).
    - Tranche 2: add if META tests the $730–$750 zone and holds, continuing to trade in a still-bullish setup.
  - If price breaks below the 200-day SMA or decisively breaks the uptrend, pause and reassess; don’t chase.

- Risk controls and hedging
  - Stop framework: apply ATR-based stops with a trailing component, roughly 10–15% from entry, adjustable for position size and volatility.
  - Optionality overlay:
    - Implement a collar: long META stock, short an OTM call to finance part of the protection, and long an OTM put for downside protection.
    - Alternatively, buy long-dated puts around key catalysts (earnings, Connect) for protection if you want more explicit downside defense.
  - Event hedges: modest option hedges around earnings or major announcements to dampen gap risk if you’re sensitive to volatility.

- Targets and horizon
  - Near-term (3–12 months): base-case upside into the high $700s to low $800s as monetization signals improve.
  - Medium-term (2–4 years): potential to the $900–$1,050+ range if AI monetization scales, licensing gains materialize, and hardware-related engagement sustains growth.
  - Very long term: stay mindful of regulatory and ad-cycle risks; maintain diversified risk.

- Catalysts and monitoring
  - Key focal points: Meta Connect updates, AI monetization milestones, Reels monetization progress, shopping uptake, licensing discussions, cash flow, buyback pace.
  - Reviews: bi-weekly price/action checks; quarterly results with emphasis on core ads growth/margins, non-ad revenue progress, and capital allocation.

- What could trigger belief in the plan reducing exposure
  - If catalysts disappoint or downside risks materialize (regulatory headwinds, slower AI monetization, weak ad trends), be prepared to tighten hedges or trim exposure quickly.

Rationale in brief
- META offers multi-vector growth potential (AI-enhanced ad efficiency, non-ad monetization, licensing, and optional hardware upside) supported by a strong balance sheet, which provides optionality and downside protection when paired with disciplined risk controls.
- The recommended execution avoids overreliance on a single catalyst and uses a staged entry with hedges to manage near-term volatility, aligning with a constructive long-term thesis.
