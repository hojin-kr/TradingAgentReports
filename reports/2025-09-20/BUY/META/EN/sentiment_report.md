I tried to fetch the latest META Reddit stock news for 2025-09-20, but the Reddit-info tool returned a FileNotFoundError (outage/misconfiguration). I can’t pull that data right now.

Options to move forward:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (if the tool is restored shortly).
- Use alternative data sources you’re comfortable with (e.g., other social platforms like X/Twitter, major news wires such as Reuters/AP, Meta press releases, earnings call transcripts, or user-provided data dumps).
- If you supply a dataset or links, I can analyze those directly and deliver the full report.

What I will deliver once I have data (long-form, trader-focused):
- Sentiment snapshot: daily sentiment distribution (positive/neutral/negative) over the past week, with notable spikes and tied events.
- Thematic analysis: top topics consumers discuss (AI/ML progress, ads revenue, Metaverse strategy, privacy/regulatory concerns, platform safety, hardware/VR merchandise).
- News & events recap: any significant Meta announcements, earnings context, regulatory developments, competitor actions, or macro drivers affecting sentiment.
- Implications for traders: how sentiment aligns with/contrasts against recent price moves, potential catalysts, risk flags (e.g., ad market weakness, regulatory headwinds, AI momentum), and a short-term directional read with caveats.
- Data-driven signals: any inferred momentum, mean-reversion indicators, or sentiment momentum shifts that could inform entries/exits.
- Final deliverable: a detailed narrative report plus a Markdown table at the end organizing key points (theme, sentiment bias, drivers, risk, and potential actionable takeaways).

If you want me to proceed now with alternate sources, tell me which sources you prefer (e.g., "use Reuters and X sentiment snapshots" or "use only company-released materials"), and I’ll start compiling the report as soon as I have the data.
