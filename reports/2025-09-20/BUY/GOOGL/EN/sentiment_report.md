I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based stock sentiment data for GOOGL across 2025-09-14 to 2025-09-20, but the tool returned errors (FileNotFoundError and a validation error when a typo crept in). I’m happy to retry with corrected inputs, but the tool currently looks unavailable on my end.

Options to move forward
1) Retry the Reddit sentiment pulls now (correcting any input issues). If you’d like me to retry, I’ll run:
   - GOOGL on 2025-09-14
   - GOOGL on 2025-09-15
   - GOOGL on 2025-09-16
   - GOOGL on 2025-09-17
   - GOOGL on 2025-09-18
   - GOOGL on 2025-09-19
   - GOOGL on 2025-09-20

2) Pivot to alternative sources for a comprehensive view:
   - Public news headlines on Alphabet/GOOGL (earnings, AI initiatives, regulatory updates, antitrust matters, cloud/YouTube performance)
   - Sentiment proxies from other socials (Twitter/X, StockTwits, news comment sections)
   - Official Alphabet press releases and major investor presentations
   - Notable market catalysts around those dates (earnings timing, product launches, regulatory developments)

3) If you prefer, I can draft the full long-form report framework and fill it in as soon as the Reddit data comes through or as soon as I have alternative sources. This would include:
   - Daily sentiment narrative (positive/neutral/negative) with volume context
   - Key topics driving sentiment (AI/Cloud/Antitrust/Regulatory risk, YouTube/Advertising trends, Hardware/Pixel devices, M&A chatter)
   - Correlation with news events and stock moves
   - Implications for traders (short-term swings, longer-term trajectory, risk factors)
   - Trading scenarios (bullish, bearish, base case) with risk controls and levels to watch
   - A concise, reader-friendly Markdown summary table of key takeaways (the table will be appended at the end of the final report)

Please tell me which path you want:
- Retry Reddit data now (I’ll run again and report back with the day-by-day sentiment)
- Use alternative sources (I’ll compile a robust sentiment/news analysis from those sources)
- Or proceed with the full report framework and fill in once data is available

Once I have your preference, I’ll deliver the comprehensive analysis and, at the end, a Markdown table organizing the key points for quick reference.
