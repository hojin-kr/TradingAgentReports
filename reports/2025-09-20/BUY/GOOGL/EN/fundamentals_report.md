I attempted to fetch the data for GOOGL (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) for 2025-09-20, but the data backend returned FileNotFoundError for all calls. I can’t complete the full fundamental report right now with these data sources.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry now or on a schedule: I can try the data fetch again in the next turn or set a retry window.
- Proceed with a partial/qualitative report: I can draft a comprehensive framework and methodology for the report, plus fill in any sections that don’t rely on the data fetch (e.g., company profile, business model, known risks, etc.), and leave placeholders for the financials to be filled once data loads.
- Use an alternate approach: If you have access to another data source or a different ticker format (GOOGL vs GOOG) you want me to try, I can adapt.

If you want me to move ahead with a structured plan while we retry, here is a ready-to-fill outline and a placeholder table you can reuse. I’ll replace placeholders with actual data as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Next steps
- Do you want me to retry data retrieval now, or at a specific time?
- If you’d like, I can proceed with the qualitative framework above and fill in the numerical sections as soon as the data tools come back online.

If you prefer, I can also try running the data fetch again in the next turn or attempt a subset (e.g., insider sentiment alone) to at least provide some momentum signals while we wait for the rest.
