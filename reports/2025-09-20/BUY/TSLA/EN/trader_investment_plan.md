Recommendation: Buy TSLA, but with disciplined risk controls and defined exposure.

Rationale
- Core thesis: TSLA’s software/AI moat, energy/storage opportunities, and scalable vehicle demand create a multi-year earnings runway beyond hardware sales. A growing data flywheel, ongoing margin improvements, and regional ramps (Europe, UAE) support durable cash generation.
- Catalysts and confidence: sustained AI/software cadence, potential upgrades and deliveries momentum, insider conviction, and a durable competitive moat (vertical integration, Supercharger network) add optionality to the upside.
- Risks to manage: valuation is rich, robotaxi monetization timing remains uncertain, regulatory/headline risk around FSD, supply/demand/macroe volatility. These are mitigated by a structured risk framework and diversified exposure.

Actionable plan (entry, sizing, risk, exits)
1) Position sizing
- Core exposure: 2–5% of your equity portfolio as a long TSLA position.
- Optional add-ons: consider a defined-risk option strategy (e.g., near-the-money call spread or calendar spread) to participate in upside with limited downside, if you’re comfortable with options.

2) Entry approach
- Price action entry: target a pullback to a defined support zone aligned with the trend (major moving-average support or a recent consolidation low). Validate with momentum cues (MACD turning positive, RSI not deeply overbought, VWMA support).
- Options approach (if used): vertical call spread or calendar spread to capture upside while capping downside/time decay risk.

3) Risk controls and hedges
- Stops: place a stop below a key support level or use an ATR-based threshold to protect against a break of the uptrend.
- Trailing risk management: implement a stop-trail to lock in gains if the uptrend weakens.
- Hedging: consider protective puts or a collar on core shares to limit downside while preserving upside.
- Diversification guardrail: keep TSLA within a reasonable weight relative to your total portfolio risk budget.

4) Profit targets and exit plan
- Tiered profit-taking:
  - Take partial profits if TSLA advances 15–25% from entry.
  - Consider a second tier at 40–60% gains; reassess risk/reward with macro/news flow.
- If thesis validates (AI/software cadence and regional growth), tighten stops to protect upside and let remaining exposure ride with a higher trailing stop.

5) Monitoring and catalysts
- Key catalysts to track: quarterly deliveries, AI/software cadence updates, regional ramp progress (Europe/UAE), and any regulatory developments around FSD.
- Warning signals: break of major trend support, deteriorating MACD with falling volume, or worsening macro backdrop (rates, subsidies) that could dent growth.

6) Learnings applied
- Don’t rely on a single catalyst (robotaxi timing). The plan emphasizes software/AI monetization and multi-vertical growth.
- Maintain defined risk controls and exit points; be prepared to trim or hedge if live data disappoints.
- Stay disciplined with sizing and trailing exits to navigate high volatility.

Bottom line
- Buy TSLA with disciplined risk management and optionality-aware exposure. The thesis rests on TSLA’s software/data moat and scalable growth across software, energy, and international ramping, which can support upside over the horizon even if robotaxi monetization remains uncertain in the near term.
