I attempted to fetch TSLA Reddit stock news for 2025-09-20, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a backend data source issue. I can try again now, or we can proceed with a best-effort, non-live synthesis using the structure of the report and public context you’ve asked for. How would you like to proceed?

In the meantime, here is a robust plan and a draft structure for the long-form report you want. I’ll fill in live sentiment data and news specifics as soon as the Reddit data source is accessible.

What I will deliver (once data fetch works)
- A comprehensive long report detailing TSLA social media sentiment (especially Reddit), recent company news, and implications for traders/investors.
- Fine-grained analysis with day-by-day sentiment, top themes, and how sentiment aligns with price/action signals.
- Trader-oriented insights: catalysts, risk factors, and scenarios (bullish/bearish/neutral).
- A concluding Makrdown table organizing key points for quick reference.

Proposed report structure
1) Executive Summary
- High-level take on TSLA sentiment trajectory, notable themes, and key implications for traders over the past week leading up to 2025-09-20.
- Quick read on potential near-term catalysts or risk factors.

2) Data & Methodology
- Data sources: Reddit stock boards (with emphasis on r/tsla, r/tesla, etc.), other social media signals, and recent headlines.
- Sentiment metrics: daily sentiment polarity, post volume, top topics/themes, and potential outlier posts.
- Limitations: sampling bias, moderation on subreddits, and news/data latency.

3) Daily Sentiment Breakdown (past 7–14 days around 2025-09-20)
- Day-by-day sentiment polarity (positive/neutral/negative)
- Volume of posts mentioning TSLA
- Notable sentiment drivers (e.g., FSD updates, product launches, price movements)
- Correlation cues with price/volume moves (if data supports)

4) Thematic Analysis: What People Are Talking About
- Core themes: product lineup and demand (Model Y/3/S, Cybertruck), AI/FSD progress, energy products, supply chain, competition, pricing strategies, regulatory/regulatory scrutiny.
- Sentiment by theme (e.g., FSD-related posts more positive when updates are favorable).

5) News & Signals Panel
- Shortlist of recent company news (earnings, product announcements, regulatory filings, partnerships) and their sentiment impact.
- Immediate implications for fundamentals and equity risk (volatility, implied volatility shifts, etc.).

6) Sentiment-Driven Insights for Traders
- Short-term catalysts to watch (dates, events, conferences)
- Signals that typically precede moves (e.g., spike in negative sentiment on a specific theme with rising post volume)
- Risk scenarios and hedging considerations (e.g., logjams in supply chain vs. demand surprises)

7) Implications & Trading Takeaways
- Practical guidance for traders/investors: timing considerations, position sizing, and risk management aligned with sentiment dynamics.
- Potential price action scenarios and what to monitor next.

8) Appendix
- Methodology details (filters, keyword lists, subreddit names)
- Data quality notes and caveats
- Glossary of sentiment terms

Draft content skeleton (with placeholders)
- The current sentiment trajectory shows [positive/neutral/negative] tilt on most days, driven by themes around [FSD progress, demand, price actions, energy products]. 
- Daily post volume has [increased/decreased] over the week, with notable spikes on [date] tied to [topic/event].
- Top sentiment drivers: [FSD update], [price cut/adjustment], [new product announcements], [regulatory news].

Notes on what would make this report highly actionable
- Clear day-by-day sentiment curves with explicit up/down days and their likely drivers.
- A map of sentiment by theme to price/volatility signals (e.g., negative sentiment on supply chain translates to risk of missed production targets).
- A short list of near-term catalysts and risk events with expected timing.

Request to proceed
- If you’d like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, I’ll run the tool again and then deliver the full, data-backed report with the daily sentiment, themes, and news implications.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative synthesis using publicly known context (without live Reddit data) and clearly label it as non-live until the data source is back online.

Makrdown table (to append at the end)
Note: Fill values after you have the live data. This is a structured template you can drop in.

| Section | Key Point (to fill) | Data/Notes | Implications for Traders |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sentiment Trend | Overall weekly sentiment tilt | e.g., Positive/Neutral/Negative | Aligns with near-term price moves? |
| Daily Sentiment Highlights | Major daily drivers | Dates and drivers (FSD, price changes, product news) | Timing of catalysts for entries/exits |

If you want me to proceed with a retry and then generate the full live report, just say “retry” and I’ll kick off another fetch and then compose the detailed analysis with the updated data.
