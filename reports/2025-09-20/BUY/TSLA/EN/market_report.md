I tried to fetch TSLA price data to generate a current-trends report, but the data retrieval failed due to a backend file error (FileNotFoundError) when calling get_YFin_data. I can retry immediately, or proceed with a robust indicator framework and a detailed TSLA trading narrative based on typical TSLA dynamics. Here’s a thorough, ready-to-use indicator setup and analysis framework you can apply as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Proposed 8-indicator set for TSLA (complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Rationale: Helps filter trades by confirming or denying the prevailing trend seen in the daily price.

- close_200_sma
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark and trend stability check (golden/death cross context).
  - Rationale: Adds macro-trend confirmation; reduces whipsaws in volatile periods.

- close_10_ema
  - Role: Short-term momentum and potential entry timing.
  - Rationale: More responsive to quick shifts in price, useful for catching faster moves around the longer-term trend.

- macd
  - Role: Momentum and trend-change signal via EMA differences.
  - Rationale: Crossovers and histogram shifts help identify shifts in tempo, especially when price is moving with high volatility.

- macds
  - Role: MACD signal line (smoothing) crossovers for trade triggers.
  - Rationale: Adds confirmation to MACD cross signals and reduces false entries when used with price/other indicators.

- rsi
  - Role: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold context.
  - Rationale: Helps gauge squeeze points or reversals, with divergence signals offering early tips.

- boll
  - Role: Bollinger middle line (20-period SMA) as a dynamic benchmark.
  - Rationale: Price interaction with the middle line helps assess whether price is centered in a normal range or leaning toward expansion/breakout when combined with other signals.

- vwma
  - Role: Volume-confirmed trend direction via volume-weighted price.
  - Rationale: Confirms that price moves are supported by volume, which is especially important for TSLA given often-spiky volume spikes around events.

How to interpret and combine (practical guidelines for TSLA)
- Trend foundation: 
  - Look for price above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA for a bullish bias; price below them suggests a bearish bias. Crossovers (especially 50_SMA crossing above/below 200_SMA) can be meaningful, but in TSLA’s environment they may be delayed; rely on MACD and VWMA for timing.

- Momentum and timing:
  - MACD crossing above its signal with a positive histogram supports a bullish tilt when price is aligned with the long-term trend.
  - A MACD signal in the same direction as RSI (e.g., RSI rising from oversold toward neutral while MACD turns up) strengthens the case for entry.

- Short-term momentum:
  - The 10_EMA can act as a proxy for intraday/short-term momentum. A bullish setup is reinforced if price trades above the 10_EMA and 50_SMA with a rising VWMA.

- Momentum quality and exhaustion:
  - RSI: avoid over-reliance on a single threshold. In strong trends, RSI can remain overbought/oversold for extended periods; use RSI in conjunction with trend (50/200 SMA) and MACD for confirmation. Look for bullish RSI momentum when price is above major moving averages and VWMA.

- Volatility and range context:
  - Boll middle (boll) serves as a dynamic centerline. Price repeatedly tracing above the boll line indicates bullish pressure; tests of boll line with rejection can imply ongoing range tests or pullbacks that may offer entries on rebounds.

- Volume credibility:
  - VWMA confirms that price moves are supported by volume. A move above/below VWMA with rising VWMA suggests stronger conviction than price action alone.

- Risk setup (conceptual):
  - If price is above all trend lines (50_SMA, 200_SMA, VWMA) and MACD is positive with RSI in a non-extreme range, consider long entries on pullbacks to the boll middle with a favorable MACD cross and rising VWMA.
  - If price drops below these trend lines and MACD turns negative while RSI heads toward oversold, consider short entries on rallies that fail near the boll middle or VWMA resistance, with ATR considerations for stop placement (note: ATR is available as a separate metric you can enable if you want a dedicated volatility stop proxy).

Next steps
- I can re-attempt data retrieval immediately and then generate a current TSLA trend report using the 8 indicators above, plus a concise set of actionable trade signals. If you’d like, I can also add ATR or a Bollinger upper/lower band view for explicit breakout signals (that would require swapping in one of the current indicators to keep to 8 total).

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now? If you prefer, I can proceed with the indicator-based narrative and wait for the data pull to complete before delivering a data-backed trend readout.

Markdown table: key indicators, roles, and signals
| Indicator | Role | What signals to watch for | How it helps TSLA decisions |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50_SMA; price cross above/below as trend shift | Confirms momentum alignment with mid-term trend; guides entry/exit context |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark and cross context | Price above/below 200_SMA; potential golden/death cross with 50_SMA | Macro-trend alignment; reduces chasing in choppy markets |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum and entry timing | Price action relative to 10_EMA; quick shifts in momentum | Helps time entries around trend support/resistance |
| macd | Momentum and trend-change signal | MACD line cross above/below signal; histogram rising/falling | Signals potential trend changes; filters entries with other signals |
| macds | MACD signal smoothing | Crosses with MACD line; aligns with histogram direction | Adds confirmation to MACD-based entries and exits |
| rsi | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold context | RSI near 70+ (overbought) or 30- (oversold); divergence cues | Avoids blindly buying overbought zones; looks for reversals with trend context |
| boll | Bollinger middle as a dynamic benchmark | Price staying above/below boll middle; interaction with band dynamics | Gauges central tendency and breakout/mean-reversion context |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend direction | Price movement in tandem with rising/falling VWMA; volume spikes | Confirms price moves with conviction; reduces reliance on price action alone |

If you’d like, I can proceed with the data fetch as soon as the backend is ready and then deliver a fully data-backed TSLA trend narrative using this exact indicator setup.
