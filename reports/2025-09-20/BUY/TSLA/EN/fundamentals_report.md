Sorry about that—the data fetch attempt failed with a FileNotFoundError across all tools:

- Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')
  Please fix your mistakes.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry all tool calls now
- Wait a moment and retry automatically
- Proceed with a high-level TSLA overview based on prior knowledge (note: may not reflect 2025-09-20 specifics)
- Provide a manual, user-supplied data dump to fill into the report

If you prefer, I can retry immediately. Just say “Retry.”

In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the comprehensive fundamentals report for TSLA (to be filled in with tool data once the fetch works):

Next step options:
- If you want, I can retry the data fetches now. Just say “Retry now.”
- If you’d prefer, you can provide any interim data you have (e.g., latest quarterly numbers or insider notes), and I’ll integrate it into the report template above.
- I can also switch to a manual synthesis mode, describing likely fundamentals for TSLA based on public patterns observed up to the last available data, with clear caveats about potential inaccuracies for 2025-09-20.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.
