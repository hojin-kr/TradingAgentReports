Recommendation: Buy

Rationale in brief
- Bull case reinforced: AAPL’s durable Services-led growth, higher incremental margins from services and AI-enabled monetization, and a strong balance sheet provide downside protection and capital-allocation optionality.
- Risks acknowledged but mitigated: iPhone cycle risk, AI monetization timing, regulatory exposure, and FX remain real, but diversification across services, geographies, and monetization levers cushions hardware-cycle sensitivity.
- Data-driven approach: Benefits from a multi-signal framework (momentum, fundamentals, cash-flow signals) rather than a single catalyst.

Concrete implementation plan (actionable now)
- Core long exposure: Start at approximately 4% of total portfolio equity for a core AAPL position.
- Incremental build: Plan to add up to a total 6–7% core exposure, phased on verifiable bullish momentum and data readouts per the 8-indicator framework (e.g., after a positive data read or confirmed bullish momentum signals).
- Entry cadence: If you are cautious, initiate now with the initial 4% and place a conditional add-on for another 2–3% once the gating indicators align with fundamentals (Services margin progress, AI monetization milestones, free-cash-flow stability).
- Risk controls:
  - Trailing stop: Implement a 15–20% trailing stop on gains or a price-based stop if price breaks below a defined up-trend line.
  - Catalyst hedges: Use a collar or protective puts around upcoming catalysts (earnings, AI milestones, regulatory updates) to limit downside if near-term sentiment sours.
- Catalysts and monitoring:
  - Key near-term signals: iPhone cycle dynamics, Services ARPU/margin trends, AI monetization progress, regulatory/App Store developments, and currency effects.
  - Review cadence: Weekly qualitative checks and monthly quantitative checks using the 8-indicator framework plus fundamental progress (Services margin, cash flow, and AI monetization pace).
- Time horizon: Multi-year upside thesis supported by Services and AI monetization; expect quarterly reviews with a willingness to scale exposure on sustained momentum and to trim on weakness.

Contingent plans
- If data or signals deteriorate:
  - Pause further adds, reassess exposure size, and consider hedging or defensively trimming core.
- If macro or regulatory risk intensifies:
  - Reduce core risk, tilt hedges higher, or trim exposure to preserve capital while maintaining optionality.

Lessons applied
- Use multi-signal confirmation rather than relying on a single catalyst.
- Align with a long-run earnings-growth thesis, not just near-term events.
- Prepare for data gaps with clear gating signals for action.
- Maintain a balanced view by acknowledging bear risks alongside bull thesis.

Two quick, actionable takeaways
- If comfortable with risk, initiate a 4% core AAPL position today, with a plan to add up to 6–7% total on confirmed momentum.
- Have a data-driven follow-up ready: when the 8-indicator framework signals align with fundamentals, scale exposure; otherwise hold steady or reduce if divergences emerge.

Final assessment
- The plan’s core conviction is soundly aligned with a Buy stance, provided you manage risk with defined stops, hedges around catalysts, and disciplined, data-driven scaling.
