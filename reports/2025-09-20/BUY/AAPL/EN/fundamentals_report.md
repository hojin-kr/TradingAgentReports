Thanks for the prompt. I ran into a tooling issue on my end while attempting to pull the latest data for AAPL. Here’s what happened and how we can move forward.

Status update
- Attempts were made to fetch data for AAPL on 2025-09-20 using:
  - Finnhub insider sentiment
  - Finnhub insider transactions
  - SimFin balance sheet (quarterly)
  - SimFin cash flow (quarterly)
  - SimFin income statement (quarterly)
- All tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError: “No such file or directory.” This appears to be an environment/tooling issue rather than a data signal about AAPL.

Proposed next steps
- Option A: Retry data retrieval now
  - I can immediately retry the data pulls. If the environment is momentarily unstable, a retry often succeeds within a short window.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, data-agnostic fundamental framework
  - If you’d like, I can deliver a comprehensive fundamental report that focuses on methodology, drivers, and qualitative interpretations (without specific numbers) and provide a structured template for you to populate once data access is restored.
- Option C: Use alternate data sources (manual) if you want numbers now
  - We can switch to publicly available sources you specify (e.g., SEC filings, company press releases, or a different data provider you have access to) to compile the report in the same structure.

What I can deliver regardless of data retrieval status
- A rigorous, trader-focused framework for AAPL fundamentals, including:
  - Company profile and product/segment overview
  - Revenue drivers and margins (qualitative interpretation)
  - Balance sheet and cash position (qualitative description of liquidity/debt posture)
  - Cash flow characteristics and capital allocation priorities
  - Earnings quality and profit sustainability checks
  - Insider sentiment and insider transaction interpretation (how to read the signals and potential implications)
  - Risk factors and catalysts (product cycles, services growth, competition, supply chain, regulatory)
  - A detailed methodology section explaining how to evaluate these signals week-by-week
- A Markdown table skeleton at the end to organize key points (to be filled with actual data once available)

Proposed outline for the comprehensive report (to be filled with data when the tooling issue is resolved)
- Executive snapshot
  - High-level qualitative view of earnings quality, margin trend, and earnings cadence
- Company profile
  - Core businesses (iPhone, Services, Mac, Wearables/Other), geographic mix, product cycles
- Income statement (qualitative read)
  - Revenue by segment, gross margin trend, operating margin drivers, R&D and SG&A allocation
- Balance sheet (qualitative read)
  - Cash and equivalents, marketable securities, debt levels and maturity, working capital dynamics
- Cash flow (qualitative read)
  - Free cash flow strength, capital allocation (buybacks, dividends, capex), cash conversion cycle
- Financial history and trend interpretation
  - Multi-quarter/annual trajectory of revenue, margins, and profitability
- Insider sentiment (interpretive lens)
  - How sentiment has trended over the last 15 days and its potential relevance to near-term moves
- Insider transactions (interpretive lens)
  - Summary of any notable purchases/sales and what they may imply about management expectations
- Key risks and catalysts
  - Product cycles, competitive dynamics, regulatory environment, macro factors
- Valuation & trading context (qualitative)
  - How fundamentals align with current price action, macro tailwinds/headwinds, and potential scenarios
- Appendix: data table and definitions

Markdown table (skeleton to be filled with actual data)
- You can paste actual values into this table once data is retrieved.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue | Quarterly revenue | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Gross Margin | Gross margin % | N/A | N/A | N/A |

| Key Risks | Top risk factors | N/A | N/A | N/A |

What would you like to do?
- If you want me to proceed immediately, I can retry the data fetch now and then generate the full, data-filled report with all sections and the final Markdown table.
- If you prefer a qualitative, data-agnostic report first, I can deliver that right away using the framework above and placeholders until data comes through.
- If you have an alternate data source you’d like me to use, tell me which one and I’ll structure the report around those figures.

Please tell me which option you’d like, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
