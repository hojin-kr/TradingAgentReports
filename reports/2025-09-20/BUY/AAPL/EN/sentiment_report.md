Sorry — the Reddit stock-info tool failed with a FileNotFoundError and didn’t return data. I can’t fetch the latest social-media/news signals right now.

Here are two ways we can proceed, pick one (or both):

Option A: Retry and fetch data
- I can try the Reddit/news fetch again now (or on a short retry interval) to pull the past week of social-media sentiment and headlines for AAPL, then produce a comprehensive, trader-focused report with granular insights and a final Makrdown table.
- If the tool continues to be unavailable, we’ll switch to Option B.

Option B: Proceed with a framework and manual input
- I’ll deliver a detailed analytical framework and a ready-to-fill report structure. You can provide any data you have (e.g., links, screenshots, or pasted Reddit headlines/tweets) or I can guide you on where to pull them, and I’ll synthesize into:
  - Daily sentiment by day (over the last 7 days)
  - Key news events and their potential impact
  - Thematic buckets from social chatter (e.g., product expectations, supply/demand, services, AI, regulatory/regulatory comments)
  - Implications for traders (short-term catalysts, risk factors, sentiment vs. price action)
  - A concise investment view with potential trades (Buy/Hold/Sell) if data supports it (without making up data)

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A, I’ll retry fetching the data immediately and then deliver the full report with the Makrmarkdown table at the end.

If you’d prefer Option B right away, here’s the structure I’ll fill in once you provide data or allow me to assume a data-less scenario:

Proposed long-form report structure (to be filled with data from social media, news, and sentiment):
- Executive snapshot
  - Current sentiment tone (overall)
  - Key catalysts in the last 7 days
  - Any notable divergence between sentiment and price action
- Daily sentiment breakdown (7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Notable posts or headlines driving spikes
- News & catalysts
  - Brief summaries of top 5-7 news items (earnings, product updates, regulatory, supply chain, macro)
  - Estimated impact on sentiment and volatility
- Social-media themes
  - Top themes (e.g., product demand, AI features, services ecosystem, privacy/security, valuation/speculation)
  - Representative quotes or post-types (without naming individuals unless public)
- Quantitative sentiment signals
  - Volume trends, polarity shifts, notable correlates with intraday price changes
- Risk factors
  - Logs of recurring concerns (expense/margin pressure, supply constraints, regulatory risk, competitive threats)
- Trader implications
  - Short-term catalysts to watch (earnings timing, product launches, keynote events)
  - Potential setups (breakout, mean-reversion, overhangs)
- Makrdown summary table (key takeaways)

Makrmarkdown table example (to fill with data):
- Metric | Last 7 days | Week-over-week delta | Interpretation
- Overall sentiment | [value] | [delta] | What it means for near-term moves
- Top theme(s) | [themes] | [notes] | Potential impact
- News catalysts | [items] | [impact] | Expected market reaction
- Price-action context | [moves] | [volatility] | How sentiment lined up with price

Please tell me which option you prefer, and if you want me to retry the Reddit/news fetch now (Option A) or proceed with Option B and you provide data or authorize a data-less framework (Option B). If you want me to retry, I’ll attempt again and report back with the full, trader-focused analysis as soon as I have data.
