I’m running into a data access issue right now.

What happened
- I attempted to fetch AAPL data with get_YFin_data for 2024-09-20 to 2025-09-20, but the call returned a FileNotFoundError. That means the environment currently can’t load the required CSV data, so I can’t generate live indicator readings or a detailed trend report from actual prices at the moment.

What you can do next
- Retry data retrieval: I can retry fetching the data now or after a short interval to see if the data source comes back online.
- Try a different date range or ticker: If you’d like, I can fetch data for a shorter window (e.g., last 6–12 months) or switch to another ticker to validate the workflow.
- Proceed with a plan (without live readings): I can provide a robust, pre-planned indicator framework for AAPL and explain how to interpret them once data is available, so you’re ready to act as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Proposed indicator framework (up to 8 indicators)
These indicators provide complementary insights (trend, momentum, and volatility) and avoid redundancy. They cover long-, medium-, and short-term perspectives and work well for a large tech stock like AAPL.

- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it tells you: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why useful here: Helps confirm the prevailing trend in a stock with strong price moves like AAPL.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it tells you: Long-term trend benchmark; watch for golden/death crosses.
  - Why useful here: Provides macro-trend context for strategic, higher-timeframe decisions.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it tells you: Responsive short-term momentum; detects quick shifts.
  - Why useful here: Can help spot nimble entry/exit points when paired with longer-term averages.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it tells you: Momentum via MACD line slope relative to zero; trend-change signals.
  - Why useful here: Apple’s price often reacts to momentum shifts around earnings or product cycles; MACD helps catch those shifts.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it tells you: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line trigger signals.
  - Why useful here: Reduces false positives when used with other filters.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it tells you: Momentum strength and early divergence indications.
  - Why useful here: Provides a quick read on the magnitude of momentum changes.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it tells you: Momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions; divergence signals.
  - Why useful here: Useful for catching reversals or confirming breakouts in a strong uptrend.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it tells you: Market volatility level; helps set stops and position sizing.
  - Why useful here: Essential for risk management in a stock with substantial intraday moves like AAPL.

Notes and caveats
- If the data is temporarily unavailable, the indicators themselves are not computed. Once the CSV is loaded, I’ll generate the indicator readings and a detailed, nuanced trends report (as you requested).
- The chosen set avoids redundancy (e.g., RSI is not paired with Stochastic RSI here) while providing a well-rounded view: trend (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum (MACD trio), momentum/price action (RSI), and volatility/risk management (ATR).
- In practice, you’ll want to corroborate signals across multiple indicators (e.g., MACD momentum with price action around the 50/200 SMA and a test of the 10-EMA for entries).

Next steps (please tell me which you want)
- Retry data fetch now.
- Try a different date range (e.g., last 12 months) or a different ticker.
- Proceed with the indicator selection and a framework-only analysis (I’ll fill in live readings as soon as data is available).

Appendix: quick reference table (indicator roles)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend confirmation; golden/death-cross context
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum and quick shifts
- macd: Momentum and potential trend-change signals
- macds: MACD signal line crossovers for trigger events
- macdh: Momentum strength and divergence indications
- rsi: Momentum extremes and potential reversals
- atr: Volatility-aware risk management (stop placement, sizing)

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry now and then run the selected indicators once the data returns. Just say “Retry” and I’ll kick off again, or tell me a different preference (date range or ticker).
