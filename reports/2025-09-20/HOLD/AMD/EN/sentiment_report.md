Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch Reddit stock data for AMD again, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It seems the Reddit data fetcher is currently failing on the backend. I can:

- Retry the Reddit data pull now, or
- Proceed with a thorough AMD analysis using other sources and structure the report so Reddit data can be appended as soon as the tool is working again.

If you’d like me to proceed with the analysis now, here’s a robust plan and a ready-to-fill report structure you can expect. I’ll fill in the Reddit sentiment sections as soon as the data tool is available again.

What I can deliver now (AMD, current state as of 2025-09-20, without Reddit data)
- Comprehensive long-form report detailing social sentiment, recent company news, and implications for traders
- Fine-grained analysis on drivers: AI/data center GPU demand, gaming GPU cycle, supply chain, product launches, competitive dynamics (NVIDIA/Intel), and macro demand
- Scenario-based trading implications (bullish/bearish/neutral) with risk considerations
- A Markdown table at the end to organize key takeaways

Proposed report outline (with placeholders where Reddit sentiment data will go)
1) Executive summary
- High-level read on AMD’s momentum, catalysts, and risk over the next 1–3 months.

2) What sentiment is signaling right now (without Reddit data)
- General social sentiment trends from other visible sources (press commentary, investor forums if accessible, typical user chatter around AI GPUs, data center demand, gaming GPU cycles).
- Any notable themes: AI adoption, new product announcements, supply/demand dynamics, price changes, or channel feedback.

3) Recent company news snapshot (past 7 days)
- Earnings/guide refinements, product launches or updates (RDNA3/4 family, Instinct GPUs, data center announcements), partnerships, supply chain updates, regulatory/compliance notes, and management commentary.

4) Core drivers and catalysts
- AI/ML compute demand and AMD’s position in data center accelerators
- Gaming GPU cycles (new console refresh rumors, release dates, and PC gamer sentiment)
- Client/enterprise adoption, embedded/RF/SoC areas if relevant
- Supply chain health, wafer allocation, manufacturing constraints or improvements

5) Competitive context
- NVIDIA progress (AI/HPC share, price actions, product cadence)
- Intel GPU strategy, potential joins in data center accelerators
- Market demand shifts (enterprise vs consumer, regional demand)

6) Sentiment analysis framework (methodology)
- How sentiment is being measured (Reddit, X, StockTwits, forums; note where Reddit data will be appended)
- Daily sentiment signals (qualitative, with placeholders for numeric scores once Reddit data is fetched)

7) Key risks
- AI demand slowdown, inventory overhang, price competition, supply chain constraints, regulatory risks, or macro headwinds

8) Trading implications and ideas
- Short-term trading signals (next 1–4 weeks) under different sentiment and news scenarios
- Positioning considerations (call/put sentiment notional bets, hedges, or earnings play)
- Risk management pointers (stop levels, position sizing guidance)

9) Data sources and methodology
- List of sources used (AMD press releases, earnings deck, major news outlets, social platforms excluding Reddit if Reddit data is unavailable)
- Caveats about data quality and timing

10) Appendix: daily sentiment plan (to be filled)
- A placeholder section where the day-by-day Reddit sentiment table will be appended once the tool is back online.

Proposed Markdown table (to be appended at the end of the report)
- I’ll populate this once Reddit data is retrieved. Here’s the structure I’ll use:

| Day (YYYY-MM-DD) | Source(s) | Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) | Key Themes | Impact on AMD (Low/Medium/High) | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------|------|
| Example 2025-09-20 | Reddit, X (example) | Neutral | AI GPU demand, supply updates | Medium | Placeholder until data returns |

Next steps
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and will integrate the Reddit sentiment analysis into the “What sentiment is signaling right now” and the day-by-day table once it returns.
- Option B: You approve proceeding with only the non-Reddit sections now, and I’ll add the Reddit portions as soon as the tool is operable again.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like, I can also attempt a quick retry right away and report back with the Reddit data (or a failure note) in the next message.
