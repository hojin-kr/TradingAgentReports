# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
Hold AMD for now. Near-term hurdles exist, but a staged upgrade to Buy could occur if data-center AI bookings, ROCm traction, and margin mix prove durable.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold. Confidence: Moderate. Pathway to Buy if milestones prove durable: two consecutive quarters of credible data-center AI bookings, solid ROCm traction, and improving data-center margins.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- What AMD does in simple terms: AMD makes central processors for servers (EPYC) and high-end graphics processors for AI and data centers (Radeon Instinct), plus software tools. The business spans data centers, game consoles, and consumer gaming.
- Why the stock could rise:
  - Long-run AI and data-center demand are positive trends, supported by AMD’s software and hardware ecosystem.
  - ROCm openness and cross-cloud potential can help AMD win multi-cloud deals and higher-margin AI workloads.
  - Using both CPU and GPU lines together creates higher switching costs for customers over time.
  - A diverse mix (data center, semi-custom, gaming) can help margins stay more resilient.
  - Key catalysts to watch: enterprise AI bookings, ROCm adoption, cross-cloud wins.
- Why the stock could stay cautious:
  - AI capex spending is uneven and tied to macro and cloud vendor cycles.
  - Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem remains a strong competitive headwind.
  - ROCm adoption risk could delay revenue and near-term margin improvement.
  - Macro and export controls could dampen AI spending momentum.
- Upgrade pathway (milestone-driven, three-pillar approach):
  - Pillars to monitor: 
    1) Data-center AI bookings or revenue visibility
    2) ROCm ecosystem traction (developer adoption, cross-cloud deployments)
    3) Data-center mix and margin signals (ASP, gross margin)
  - Upgrade triggers are staged rather than all-at-once:
    - Early trigger: some ROCm traction or enterprise ROCm deployment with ROI signals plus steady margins.
    - Moderate trigger: two quarters of credible data-center bookings plus ROCm momentum and early margin improvement.
    - Full Buy with conviction: two consecutive quarters of credible AI bookings, strong ROCm traction, and a meaningful data-center mix lift that boosts margins.

## Risks To Watch
- AI capex demand can be lumpy and spotty, affected by broader tech cycles and cloud budget shifts.
- Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem remains a major competitive advantage and could limit AMD’s share gains.
- ROCm adoption is not guaranteed to translate into immediate revenue and may keep near-term margins under pressure.
- Macro factors or export controls could slow AI capex momentum.
- Execution risk and valuation concerns could drive near-term volatility even if the long-run thesis stays intact.
