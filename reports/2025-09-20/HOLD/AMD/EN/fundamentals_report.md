Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch AMD data (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, insider sentiment, and insider transactions) for 2025-09-20 using the available tools, but all attempts returned a FileNotFoundError in the environment. That means the data sources or the tool endpoints are temporarily unavailable right now.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval as soon as the tool environment is back up.
- If you’d like, proceed with a thorough qualitative framework now and fill in the numbers later when data access is restored.
- Provide a high-level AMD fundamental overview based on public information up to my knowledge cutoff (note: this may be outdated for 2025 specifics).

Recommended approach (when data access is restored)
1) Core financials (most recent quarterly)
   - Income statement: revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EBITDA, margins.
   - Balance sheet: assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio), leverage.
   - Cash flow: operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow, cash conversion.

2) Financial history and trends
   - Revenue and profitability history (growth rates, margin trends).
   - Cash flow consistency and capex intensity.
   - Debt levels and interest coverage.

3) Company profile and segments
   - AMD’s business segments (e.g., Computing and Graphics, Enterprise, Data Center, Semi-custom) and geographic mix if available.
   - Key product cycles (e.g., new CPU/GPU generations, AI accelerators) and their impact on demand and margins.

4) Insider sentiment and insider transactions
   - Last 15 days’ insider sentiment (views on near-term prospects, risk appetite) and notable insider trades.
   - Any pattern in insider activity that could inform confidence or concern.

5) Trader-focused insights
   - Margin of safety from profitability and cash flow vs. debt.
   - Catalysts (new product launches, AI demand, data center TAM, supply/demand dynamics) and risks (competition, supply chain, cyclicality).
   - Valuation context (multiples vs. peers, historical ranges, and growth expectations) and sensitivity to AI-driven demand.

6) Append a concise executive summary and a decision-ready table (see template below).

What I can provide right now (without the missing data)
- A detailed report structure you can copy-paste and fill in once data is available.
- A ready-to-use Markdown table template at the end to organize key points for quick reference.

Would you like me to:
- Retry fetching the data now and then generate the full comprehensive report, or
- Proceed with the qualitative AMD overview now (no numbers) and fill in the data later when the tools are available?

If you prefer, I can also start with a high-level AMD narrative based on known industry context and AMD’s typical drivers, clearly labeled as a qualitative overview to be updated with exact figures once the data tools come back online.
