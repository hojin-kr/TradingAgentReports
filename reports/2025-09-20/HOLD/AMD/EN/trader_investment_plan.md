Recommendation: Hold AMD now.

Rationale
- The plan’s long-run thesis remains credible: AI/data-center demand is a multi-year tailwind, AMD’s cross-architecture strategy and ROCm ecosystem could yield durable competitive advantages.
- Near-term risks remain meaningful: AI capex is lumpy, Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem sustains a competitive moat, and data-center margins could be pressured by mix changes and input costs. These factors argue against jumping to a Buy today.
- The proposed milestones provide a disciplined upgrade path: two consecutive quarters of verifiable data-center AI bookings with revenue visibility, plus stable or expanding gross margins and ROCm ecosystem traction, would meaningfully validate the bull case and support a Buy upgrade.

Milestones to upgrade to Buy
- Two consecutive quarters of confirmed data-center AI bookings or enterprise AI engagements with verifiable revenue visibility.
- Stable or expanding gross margins driven by a meaningful data-center mix shift, sustained over at least two quarters.
- Tangible ROCm ecosystem traction indicators (developer adoption, cross-cloud deployments, or customer demonstrations) showing SCIENTIFIC progress and multi-cloud wins.

Triggers to downgrade or trim
- Data-center bookings stall for two consecutive quarters, or gross margins show sustained compression without signs of stabilization.
- Clear evidence of intensified CUDA-driven migrations or a major missed AMD product milestone.
- Worsening macro headwinds or regulatory constraints materially impair AI capex momentum.

Risk controls and execution plan
- Position sizing: maintain a core-but-modest exposure (e.g., 1–3% of portfolio) with disciplined stops.
- Stop strategy: use an ATR-based stop (roughly 1.5x–2x the current ATR below entry) and trail as the position moves.
- Diversification: consider hedges or a semiconductor/AI-infrastructure sleeve (e.g., a diversified AI/data-center semiconductor exposure) to reduce single-name risk.
- Review cadence: quarterly review focused on data-center bookings, margin trajectory, ROCm adoption metrics, and any product-cycle updates.

Lessons implemented
- Emphasize milestone-driven decisions over hype; require multi-quarter, verifiable execution.
- Demand evidence across multiple pillars (data-center demand, software ecosystem, and cross-architecture adoption) rather than relying on a single driver.
- Apply strict risk controls to manage volatility and avoid over-allocating to a name with near-term uncertainty.
