I attempted to fetch AMD price data to generate the indicator readings, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError (data source issue). I can retry immediately or wait for you to approve a retry window or a different date range. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators and why they’re suitable for AMD, along with how to use them together once the data is available.

Selected indicators (8 total) and rationale
1) close_10_ema
- What it measures: Short-term momentum via the 10-period EMA.
- Why AMD: AMD tends to exhibit quick moves around earnings and product cycle news. The 10 EMA helps flag rapid momentum shifts and potential entry/exit points in choppy or news-driven periods.
- How to use: Look for crossovers of price above/below the 10 EMA as early momentum signals. Use in conjunction with longer-term trend filters (e.g., 50/200 SMA) to avoid false signals.

2) close_50_sma
- What it measures: Mid-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why AMD: Serves as a reliable anchor for trend direction after earnings-driven moves and during sector rotations.
- How to use: Confirm trend direction; price above 50 SMA suggests bullish bias, below suggests bearish bias. Use with faster indicators for timing.

3) close_200_sma
- What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark.
- Why AMD: Helps identify the macro regime (longer-term bull/bear context) and signals potential golden/death cross setups.
- How to use: Use as a trend filter; trades align with the market’s longer-term trajectory. Be mindful of lag and use additional momentum signals for timing.

4) macd
- What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs (MACD line and signal line dynamics).
- Why AMD: Captures shifts in momentum around major catalysts (earnings, AI/semiconductor cycle news) and can help confirm trend changes.
- How to use: Look for MACD line crossing above/below the signal line, plus color/direction of histogram as momentum strength. Crossovers in conjunction with price/volume confirmation are stronger.

5) macds
- What it measures: MACD Signal (the EMA of the MACD line).
- Why AMD: Helps filter MACD cross signals and reduce false positives in volatile periods.
- How to use: Use MACD vs MACD Signal cross signals as triggers, but require alignment with price action and other indicators.

6) rsi
- What it measures: Momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
- Why AMD: In high-volatility periods (e.g., product launches or supply-demand shifts), RSI can flag overextension or potential reversals.
- How to use: Watch for divergences with price, or crossing thresholds like 70/30 with additional trend confirmation. In strong trends, RSI can stay extended, so rely on trend context.

7) boll
- What it measures: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a volatility-adjusted baseline.
- Why AMD: Useful for spotting breakouts and mean-reversion opportunities around a well-defined middle band during varying volatility regimes.
- How to use: Breakouts above/below the middle line with confirmation from other indicators (e.g., MACD, RSI) add strength. Especially watch how price interacts with the middle line during earnings weeks.

8) atr
- What it measures: Average True Range, a volatility metric.
- Why AMD: Helps calibrate risk and position sizing in a stock with episodic volatility. Useful for setting stop losses and understanding how much price movement to expect.
- How to use: Use ATR to set ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.5x ATR from entry) and to adjust position sizing as volatility changes.

How to use these together (a practical framework)
- Trend filter: Confirm with 50 SMA and 200 SMA. If price is above both and the 10 EMA is above price (or moving up toward the 50 SMA), bias is bullish; if below, bias is bearish.
- Momentum confirmation: Look for MACD/macd signal alignment with the direction of price and the 10 EMA. A bullish crossover with rising histogram supports entries; a bearish crossover supports exits or short entries.
- Momentum health: RSI should confirm the momentum signal but not overrule it in strong trends. For example, a bullish setup with RSI not in overbought territory adds credibility.
- Volatility and risk: Use Bollinger bands to gauge breakout potential and ATR to size stops appropriately. A rising ATR suggests wider stops but potentially bigger moves; a shrinking ATR indicates compression and potential breakout risk.
- Entry/exit cues: Combine a price close above/below the middle Bollinger band with MACD/MS cross signals and a supportive RSI reading. Use ATR-derived stops to manage risk.

Next steps
- I will retry data retrieval to generate the actual indicator values for AMD as of 2025-09-20. If you’d like, I can also adjust the look-back window (e.g., 20-30 days) or the date range to ensure a robust sample.
- Once data is retrieved, I’ll provide:
  - A detailed trend analysis with current readings for each of the 8 indicators.
  - A concise set of actionable signals (e.g., bullish/bearish setups and suggested risk controls).
  - A Markdown table summarizing key points and how to use each indicator together.
