I attempted to fetch NFLX data and the associated indicators, but I’m running into a data I/O error in the environment:

- The data retrieval step (get_YFin_data) and all indicator fetches returned FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory.
- I retried with multiple indicator calls in parallel, and the same error occurred.

Because of this environment issue, I can’t generate the live NFLX indicator readings right now. If you can retry in a few minutes or provide a local CSV with NFLX price history, I can proceed immediately. In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan of what I will do and why these indicators are suitable for NFLX given typical market dynamics, followed by a concise, organized summary table.

What I will deliver once data is available
- Indicators to pull (up to 8, chosen for complementary signals with minimal redundancy):
  1) close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
     - Why: Identifies the medium-term trend and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm trend direction relative to the price.
  2) close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
     - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for identifying major trend regime (bullish/bearish) and for golden/death cross context when paired with shorter averages.
  3) close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
     - Why: Captures short-term momentum shifts and potential early entry/exit signals. More responsive than the 50/200 SMAs.
  4) macd (MACD line)
     - Why: Momentum trend signal via the difference of two EMAs. Crosses around zero are useful trend-change signals when aligned with other filters.
  5) macds (MACD Signal)
     - Why: The smoothing of MACD; crossovers with the MACD line provide more robust entry/exit cues when used with a trend filter.
  6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
     - Why: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence tendencies. Positive/negative histogram changes help gauge momentum acceleration or deceleration.
  7) rsi (Relative Strength Index)
     - Why: Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals, with divergence signals to watch for.
  8) atr (Average True Range)
     - Why: Measures volatility to inform position sizing, stop placement, and risk management. Helps adapt to changing market conditions.

- How I will interpret them together (high-level framework):
  - Trend confirmation: Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA suggests bullish bias; price below both suggests bearish bias. A crossover where the 50SMA crosses the 200SMA (golden/death cross) adds a longer-term signal.
  - Momentum: MACD line above MACD Signal and both above/below zero indicates sustainable momentum direction; MACD Histogram rising suggests strengthening momentum.
  - Short-term timing: 10 EMA movement versus price action can flag quick shifts; look for alignment with MACD for stronger entries.
  - Overbought/oversold context: RSI near or beyond 70/30 thresholds may imply pullbacks or reversals when not strongly supported by trend.
  - Volatility risk: ATR helps assess stop distance and position sizing; rising ATR implies wider stops and potentially larger moves.
  - Trade-off considerations: In high-volatility regimes (high ATR, price far from moving averages, RSI elongated in one direction), prefer confirmations from MACD and price-position relative to longer SMAs rather than chasing trades on a single indicator.

- Potential NFLX-specific nuance I’ll incorporate once data is available:
  - Earnings-driven moves: Check for gaps or fast retracements around earnings history; use ATR to size stops and consider waiting for a pullback to a confluence of MA levels or MACD zero-crosses for entries.
  - Post-market behavior: If NFLX tends to gap and normalize, give extra weight to longer-term trends (50/200 SMA) for bias while using MACD/histogram and RSI for timing.
  - Volume context (optional add-on if available): If I can pull VWMA later, I’d look for price moves on high volume to confirm breakouts or reversals in the context of the above indicators.

What you can do now
- If you can re-run the data fetch later, I’ll immediately compute and present:
  - A detailed trend and momentum narrative for NFLX as of 2025-09-20 (or the latest date available in your data).
  - Clear buy/hold/sell considerations based on the integrated signal confluence.
  - A crisp Markdown table summarizing the key observations and recommended actions.

Proposed indicators table (for quick reference)
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Category: Moving Averages | Rationale: Medium-term trend + dynamic support/resistance
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Category: Moving Averages | Rationale: Long-term trend confirmation
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Category: Moving Averages | Rationale: Short-term momentum capture
- Indicator: macd | Category: MACD Related | Rationale: Momentum trend changes via EMA differences
- Indicator: macds | Category: MACD Related | Rationale: Signal line crossovers for trade triggers
- Indicator: macdh | Category: MACD Related | Rationale: Momentum strength and divergence cues
- Indicator: rsi | Category: Momentum Indicators | Rationale: Overbought/oversold context and divergences
- Indicator: atr | Category: Volatility Indicators | Rationale: Volatility-based risk management and stop placement

Markdown table: Key points (to be filled with actual data once retrieved)
- The final table will summarize:
  - Indicator, Category, Current reading (when available)
  - Trend/momentum interpretation
  - Signals to watch (bullish/bearish/neutral)
  - Suggested action plan (e.g., watch for crossovers, wait for pullback to MA, adjust stops with ATR)

Next steps
- Please retry data retrieval when the environment is ready, or share a CSV with NFLX price data (start date 2023-01-01 to 2025-09-20). Once I have the data, I will produce:
  - A very detailed, point-by-point trend and momentum analysis for NFLX
  - Up to 8 complementary indicators with clear buy/hold/sell signals and risk considerations
  - A final Markdown table organizing the key takeaways for quick reference

If you’d like, I can attempt a smaller, local test (e.g., a single indicator) using a manual sample dataset you provide, just to demonstrate the output format while we wait for the full data pipeline to come back online.
