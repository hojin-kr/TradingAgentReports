Thanks for the ticker. Quick status: I attempted to fetch PLTR data with the requested date range, but the data retrieval backend is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a temporary issue with the data source path. I can retry automatically, or you can specify a narrower window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to see if the backend handles it better. Alternatively, I can proceed with a robust indicator plan now and run once the data fetch succeeds.

Given we can’t fetch the CSV right now, here’s a strong, complementary set of up to 8 indicators I’d run for PLTR to give a well-rounded view (trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context). These selections avoid redundancy and are suitable for a volatile growth name like PLTR.

Recommended indicator set (names exactly as provided)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average to gauge medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average to confirm longer-term trend and potential golden/death-cross context.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average to capture quick momentum shifts and potential entries.
- macd: MACD line to identify momentum changes and trend direction via crossovers/divergence.
- macds: MACD Signal line to trigger trades with MACD crossovers; helps reduce false signals when used with MACD and other filters.
- macdh: MACD Histogram to visualize momentum strength and spot early divergence; useful in fast markets when MACD lines lag.
- rsi: RSI to flag overbought/oversold conditions and watch for bullish/bearish divergences in momentum.
- atr: ATR to gauge volatility regime and inform risk management (stop placement, position sizing) in volatile periods.

Why these are suitable for PLTR
- PLTR tends to exhibit shifting volatility and multi-month trend cycles. The 50/200 SMAs provide a clear framework for trend context; the 10 EMA adds sensitivity to near-term shifts.
- MACD components add depth on momentum and possible trend-change signals; RSI provides momentum-based confirmations and potential reversals.
- ATR adds a critical risk-management lens in a name known for sudden moves, helping size risk and place stops more adaptively.

What I’ll look for once the data is available
- Trend alignment: price above/below 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with potential crossovers indicating regime changes (golden/death cross implications).
- Momentum alignment: MACD line relative to the MACD signal, with MACD histogram strength confirming or warning about momentum exhaustion; RSI confirming momentum rather than simply following it (watch for divergences).
- Volatility regime: ATR trends rising during breakouts or compressing during consolidations; use ATR to size stops dynamically.
- Entry/exit filters: when multiple indicators align (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA, MACD bullish crossover, RSI above 50 but not in extreme overbought territory), consider a longer-horizon entry with ATR-based stop. Conversely, bearish alignment could signal a fade or protective exit.

Proposed approach for PLTR trading decisions (when data is back)
- Trend filter: require price above (or below) both 50 SMA and 200 SMA for entries in the direction of the longer-term trend.
- Momentum confirmation: look for MACD bullish/bearish cross with histogram momentum supporting the move; RSI should align with MACD signals but avoid overbought/oversold extremes without trend confirmation.
- Volatility control: use ATR to set stop distances; higher ATR implies wider stops, lower ATR implies tighter stops, all else equal.
- Position sizing and risk: adjust position size with ATR-based volatility scaling; consider trailing stops as MACD/histogram momentum evolves.

Would you like me to retry fetching the PLTR data now (with the same date range), or should I proceed with a narrower window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to see if the backend responds more reliably? If you prefer, I can also start by running the indicator analysis with the plan above and report back as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Appendix: quick reference table of the planned indicators (for PLTR)
- Indicator: close_50_sma | What it measures: 50-day trend level and dynamic support/resistance | How to use: gauge medium-term trend direction; look for price interaction with the 50 SMA
- Indicator: close_200_sma | What it measures: long-term trend benchmark | How to use: confirm overall trend direction; watch for cross with price and other signals
- Indicator: close_10_ema | What it measures: near-term momentum | How to use: identify quick momentum shifts; use with longer-term filters to reduce noise
- Indicator: macd | What it measures: momentum via EMA differences | How to use: MACD line vs. signal crossovers as momentum change signals
- Indicator: macds | What it measures: MACD signal line momentum | How to use: crossovers with MACD line to trigger entries/exits
- Indicator: macdh | What it measures: MACD histogram momentum strength | How to use: confirm momentum intensity and divergence clues
- Indicator: rsi | What it measures: momentum strength and overbought/oversold | How to use: watch for level breaks and divergences in conjunction with trend
- Indicator: atr | What it measures: market volatility | How to use: set stops and position sizing; interpret rising/falling volatility regimes

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed (retry now, or adjust the date window), and I’ll run the data fetch and the indicator analysis accordingly.
