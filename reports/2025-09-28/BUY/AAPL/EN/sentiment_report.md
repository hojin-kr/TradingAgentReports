Thanks for your patience. I attempted to fetch the daily Reddit sentiment data for AAPL across the past week, but the Reddit data tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can’t retrieve the daily posts/sentiment right now. Here are your options and what I can deliver in each case:

What I can do right now
- Provide a detailed, fully-structured long-form analysis framework for AAPL based on social media sentiment, public sentiment, and recent news, with clearly labeled placeholders for the Reddit metrics once the data tool is available.
- Prepare a comprehensive report template plus a Markdown summary table you can drop numbers into once the data fetch works again.
- If you have any offline data (e.g., a CSV or pasted daily sentiment scores, post summaries, or key threads you’ve extracted), paste it here and I’ll analyze it in depth.

What I can deliver now (without the live Reddit data)
I’ll present a complete, trader-focused report skeleton, including sections, metrics to track, and a sample Markdown table with placeholders. This will be ready to fill in immediately once the Reddit data channel is back.

Proposed report structure (ready to fill in with Reddit data)
- Executive Summary
  - High-level read on sentiment across the past 7 days
  - Key risk and opportunity signals for traders
  - Immediate implications for trading stance (HOLD/BUY/SELL) once data is quantified

- Data Snapshot (to be filled in once Reddit tool works)
  - Daily sentiment index (e.g., -1 to +1 or 0-100)
  - Daily post volume for AAPL on Reddit
  - Top subreddits driving discussion (e.g., r/investing, r/stocks, r/apple)
  - Most upvoted/engaged posts per day
  - Notable themes by day (e.g., product rumors, earnings expectations, supply chain talk, regulatory concerns)

- Weekly Sentiment Trend and Breakdown
  - Overall sentiment trend (weekly trajectory)
  - Day-by-day sentiment deltas with brief rationale (what happened that day)
  - Volatility of sentiment (standard deviation or other metric)

- Top Themes, Narratives, and Risk Signals
  - Product/innovation chatter: new devices, features, or software updates
  - Financial/valuation chatter: multiples, buybacks, guidance
  - Market/sector sentiment: tech rotations, competitors, AI framing
  - Risks mentioned by the community: supply chain, regulatory issues, macro concerns
  - Any notable mispricings or sentiment-contrarian signals

- News and Events Impact (Past Week)
  - Summary of company-wide news, press releases, product events, earnings commentary
  - How these events aligned with Reddit sentiment (positive/negative resonance)

- Comparative Sentiment Context
  - Benchmark against tech sector sentiment (when relevant)
  - Compare AAPL sentiment to a control like MSFT or GOOG if data is available

- Trading Implications and Scenarios
  - If sentiment improves: rationale for near-term upside, potential catalysts
  - If sentiment worsens: potential downside risks, risk controls, hedging ideas
  - Price-action considerations: how sentiment aligns with recent price moves, volume spikes, intraday patterns
  - Suggested tactical approaches: short-term trades, option strategies, or hedges

- Risks and Limitations
  - Data quality caveats (persistence of bot accounts, spam, fake posts)
  - Reddit sentiment vs. broader market sentiment risk
  - Time-lag between Reddit chatter and price impact

- Actionable Takeaways
  - Clear, concise bullets for traders: what to watch this week, levels to monitor, and any potential entry/exit signals

- Appendix (Data Dictionary)
  - Definitions for all metrics used
  - Data sources and weighting methodology (once defined)

Proposed Markdown table (structure to fill with actual data)

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the Reddit data as soon as the tool environment is functioning again. If you’d like, I can keep attempting at intervals and deliver a fully filled report as soon as I can pull the daily figures.
- Alternatively, you can provide any of the following to speed up delivery:
  - A CSV or pasted data for the past 7 days with columns: Date, Sentiment, PostCount, TopSubreddits, KeyThemes, NotablePosts
  - A list of the top Reddit threads/pages you’re tracking
  - Any offline sentiment scores you already have

Would you prefer:
1) I keep retrying the Reddit data fetch now and deliver the full report as soon as it comes back, or
2) I proceed with a high-quality qualitative analysis focusing on recent company news and general social sentiment, plus a detailed framework you can fill in later, or
3) You provide any data you have (CSV/text), and I’ll start the analysis immediately using that data?

I’m ready to proceed with any of these options and can tailor the output to your preferred depth and format.
