I attempted to fetch AAPL data for 2024-09-28 to 2025-09-28 but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a backend/tool issue rather than a user data problem. I can retry, switch to a different date range, or proceed with a robust indicator framework now and fill in the live data later when the feed is available. Below I’ve laid out a concise, well-structured indicator setup (8 indicators) with a detailed, nuanced framework you can use as soon as data is accessible.

Selected indicators (8 total, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction, dynamic support/resistance; helps gauge medium-term trend strength.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend baseline; useful for confirming major trend direction and for golden/death cross awareness.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures short-term momentum shifts; reacts quickly to price changes for timely signals.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum measure based on EMA differences; crossovers help identify potential trend changes.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoothing of MACD; MACD vs MACDS crossovers provide trading signals with reduced noise when used with other filters.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength and potential divergence signal; useful to spot acceleration or weakening momentum.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; watch for divergences and consider trend context.
- atr: ATR. Volatility gauge; informs position sizing, stop placement, and risk management in line with current volatility.

Why these indicators are suitable for AAPL in a typical late-cycle/tech-equity context
- Trend framing (50SMA, 200SMA): AAPL often exhibits clear medium- to long-term trends driven by product cycles and earnings. Having both a medium-term (50SMA) and a long-term (200SMA) view helps confirm the prevailing regime and filter noise.
- Momentum confirmation (MACD family, RSI): MACD crossovers (MACD with MACDS and MACDH) provide a multi-faceted momentum view, while RSI adds a momentum-neutral stance on overbought/oversold zones and potential reversals. Together they help distinguish gravitational pull in either direction from mere consolidations.
- Volatility and risk management (ATR): Apple can experience earnings-driven and macro-driven volatility spikes. ATR helps set break-even/stop levels that adapt to current ranges, mitigating risk during wide price swings.
- Balance of signals: This set avoids overlap between stochastic-like momentum (not selected) and focuses on robust trend/momentum/volatility lenses. It also keeps the indicator count to 8 for practicality and complementary coverage.

Nuanced report framework (how to interpret once you have live data)
- Trend confirmation
  - If price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA and 50SMA is above 200SMA, the horizon is bullish; look for MACD lines crossing above zero and an expanding MACD histogram to add conviction.
  - If price sits below both SMAs or the 50SMA crosses below the 200SMA, view as bearish or transitional; wait for MACD to confirm a momentum shift and RSI to not contradict the trend (e.g., RSI not deeply oversold in a downtrend).
- Momentum nuance
  - MACD crossovers (MACD vs MACDS) signaling a bullish shift should align with a rising MACD histogram (MACDH > 0) and RSI holding above midline (e.g., RSI > 50) for higher probability entries.
  - A rising RSI toward overbought territory (RSI approaching 70) in a strong uptrend requires confirmation from MACD and price staying above key SMAs to avoid overextended pullbacks.
  - If MACD remains negative or the MACD histogram contracts while price edges higher, be cautious of a weakening up-leg; wait for a MACD positive signal and price confirmation.
- Volatility and risk control
  - Rising ATR indicates expanding ranges; tighten risk controls and position sizing accordingly. Use ATR-based stop placement to avoid premature exits on normal volatility spikes.
  - In calmer markets (ATR low), smaller stops and tighter entry criteria can improve risk-reward. Confirm with MACD/RSI to avoid range-bound traps.
- Breakouts and pullbacks
  - Bollinger-like context (via Bollinger Middle in practice) with price trading above the middle line tends to accompany meaningful moves when combined with MACD and RSI alignment.
  - A price pullback toward or just above the 50SMA in a bullish regime, with MACD still positive and RSI holding above 40–50, can present a low-risk entry in an uptrend.
- Caveats and cross-checks
  - In choppy markets, MACD signals may lag or produce false positives. Rely on multiple filters (price above/below SMAs, RSI trend, and ATR signals) before acting.
  - Ensure the overall macro context (earnings timing, sector strength, risk-on/off sentiment) aligns with the signal set to avoid overfitting to micro-movements.

Proposed practical sections for use once data is available
- Trend view: Confirm with price relative to 50SMA/200SMA and the relative order (golden cross or death cross signals).
- Momentum entry/exit: Use MACD/macds/macdh in conjunction with RSI to time entries and exits; avoid trading solely on a single MACD cross.
- Risk management: Use ATR to set initial stops and position sizes; adjust according to current volatility regime.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AAPL | Practical takeaway |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA and 50SMA above 200SMA suggests a bullish regime; consolidation or declines when price is below | Use as a trend filter; prefer long entries when 50SMA supports price from above |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA indicates long-term uptrend bias; below suggests downtrend bias | Use as strategic trend confirmation; golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) strengthens bulls |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick reaction to price changes; can precede longer-term trend changes | Use for timing entries in conjunction with longer SMAs and MACD signals |
| macd | Momentum momentum (MACD line) | Positive MACD above zero with rising histogram indicates bullish momentum; negative and declining indicates weakness | Look for MACD crossing zero and expanding histogram as confirmation |
| macds | MACD Signal (smoothing) | Cross of MACD above MACDS is a bullish signal; below is bearish | Use with MACD for confirmation to reduce false signals |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Positive histogram confirms momentum strength; rising histogram means accelerating momentum | Watch for divergence between price and histogram as a warning sign |
| rsi | Momentum strength and reversal potential | RSI rising toward 70+ supports uptrends; falling toward 30–40 supports reversals | Use with trend context; beware of overbought in strong uptrends |
| atr | Volatility level | Higher ATR means wider price ranges and larger stop buffers; lower ATR means tighter ranges | Align position sizing and stops with ATR to manage risk in varying volatility |

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval as soon as the data tool is back online. If you’d like, I can attempt the fetch again now or switch to a different date range (e.g., a shorter window like 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-28) to ensure we have a dataset to generate the actual indicator values.
- Alternatively, if you prefer immediate actionable guidance, I can proceed with a hypothetical scenario using the above indicators to demonstrate how to interpret signals on AAPL. Let me know which you prefer.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, try a different date range, or proceed with the hypothetical scenario using the indicator framework above?
