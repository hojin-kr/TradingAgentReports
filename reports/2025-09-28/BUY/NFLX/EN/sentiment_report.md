Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock news for NFLX on 2025-09-28, but the tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError). It looks like a system issue with the data tool rather than with the request. I can retry shortly or proceed with a detailed scaffold now and fill in the Reddit data once the tool is functioning again.

Here are two options:
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then deliver a full, data-backed NFLX sentiment report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: I proceed immediately with a comprehensive, data-agnostic analysis framework (methodology, expected signals to watch, and a filled-out report skeleton) so you can review the approach while I re-run the data fetch in the background.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A, I’ll retry the Reddit data call and then produce the full report as soon as data comes back. If you’d prefer Option B, here is a detailed scaffold you can review right away, with placeholders for the data to be filled in once the Reddit tool works.

NFLX Sentiment and News Analysis — Framework and Preliminary Insights (Scaffold)

1) Executive snapshot (what to look for this week)
- Primary driver: Netflix-related sentiment on social platforms (especially Reddit) and any fresh company news (pricing, content strategy, subscriber trends, partnerships).
- Key questions:
  - Are posts focusing on content quality, price hikes, or ad-supported plans?
  - Are there notable shifts in sentiment around upcoming content releases or earnings guidance?
  - Is there heightened chatter around competition (e.g., new streaming entrants, price wars) influencing NFLX sentiment?

2) Methodology overview
- Data sources: Reddit stock/forum posts (primary), plus any ancillary social signals if available (Twitter/X, StockTwits, etc.), and a scan of recent NFLX earnings/press coverage.
- Sentiment scoring: categorize posts into positive/neutral/negative; compute daily sentiment scores (weighted by post engagement where possible).
- Trend granularity: daily sentiment deltas, with rolling 3-7 day windows to identify momentum shifts.
- Event tagging: annotate posts by event type (content release, price change, subscriber milestone, pricing moves, partnerships, regulatory news).
- Risk/volatility lenses: correlate sentiment shifts with price/volume spikes and options activity (where data is available).

3) Daily sentiment analysis (week view)
- Day-by-day sentiment: sentiment score, post volume, top themes, and notable thread tags (e.g., “subscriber growth,” “pricing,” “new releases”).
- Narrative clusters: summarize the dominant narratives driving sentiment on each day (e.g., optimism around upcoming titles vs. concern about price increases).

4) Notable Reddit threads and themes (placeholder structure)
- Thread A: Topic, sentiment tag, engagement metrics (upvotes/comments), and a brief summary of the stance (bullish/bearish/neutral).
- Thread B: Topic, sentiment tag, engagement metrics, and key quotes or claims.
- Thread C: Topic, sentiment tag, engagement metrics, and any consensus or division hints.

5) Recent company news and catalysts (last 1-2 weeks)
- Earnings guidance or results (subscriber numbers, ARPU, churn).
- Pricing strategy updates (new plans, price hikes, regional differences).
- Content strategy developments (major releases, partnerships, international expansion).
- Regulatory or competitive developments affecting the streaming space.

6) Market microstructure signals to watch
- Price action: any sharp moves coinciding with sentiment shifts.
- Volume spikes: unusual volume on negative/positive sentiment days.
- Options skew (if available): tail risk/bet sizing around earnings or key catalysts.
- Implied volatility (where trackable): IV spikes around major content drops or earnings.

7) Implications for traders and investors
- Short-term trading signals:
  - Positive sentiment spike with corroborating news (e.g., new content release) could imply a short-term upside bias.
  - Deteriorating sentiment ahead of or after pricing news might signal risk to near-term price.
- Medium-term considerations:
  - Persistent sentiment divergence from price action may indicate an inflection point (e.g., sentiment improving while price lags, or vice versa).
- Risk factors:
  - Content slate dependence (holidays, blockbuster releases) can be a key swing factor.
  - Competitive pressure and monetization strategy (ads, pricing) remain ongoing catalysts.

8) Makrdown table — key takeaways (to be filled after data retrieval)
- The final report will include a Markdown table with rows like:
  - Date
  - Daily sentiment score
  - Post volume
  - Top themes
  - Notable threads (examples)
  - Related price move
  - News catalyst
  - Trader takeaway

9) What I’ll deliver once data is in
- A fully populated, day-by-day sentiment report for NFLX over the last week (or the exact date range you specify), including:
  - charts or summarized metrics (described in text if charts aren’t embeddable here)
  - a narrative synthesis of the sentiment and news drivers
  - a final table of key takeaways for quick reference

Next steps
- Please choose Option A (retry data fetch now) or Option B (proceed with the scaffold). If you pick A, I’ll retry the Reddit data pull for NFLX on 2025-09-28 and then deliver the full, data-backed report with the Markdown table appended at the end.
- If you’re okay with proceeding right away with the scaffold, I’ll begin drafting the narrative sections and will fill in the data as soon as the Reddit tool returns results.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or should I proceed with the scaffold and fill in data once the tool is back online?
