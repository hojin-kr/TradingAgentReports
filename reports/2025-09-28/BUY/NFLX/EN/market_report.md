I attempted to fetch NFLX data and generate the specified indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError (environment/file issue). I can’t produce a data-backed, trend-by-trend report until the data is accessible. Here’s what I can do right now and the indicator set I recommend monitoring once data becomes available.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for NFLX
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages, short-term momentum)
  - Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Useful for timing within ongoing trends, especially around earnings or product-cycle events where volatility can spike.
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages, mid-term trend)
  - Provides a dynamic view of the intermediate trend and acts as a support/resistance reference. Helps confirm whether the short-term moves align with the intermediate trend.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages, long-term trend)
  - Serves as a long-term trend benchmark. Useful for assessing macro direction and identifying potential “golden cross” or “death cross” style confirmations over a broader horizon.
- macd (MACD momentum)
  - Highlights momentum changes via MACD line crossovers and divergence. Helps identify potential trend changes in conjunction with price action and longer-term indicators.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - The smoothing line for MACD; crossovers with MACD provide clearer entry/exit signals when used with confirmatory indicators.
- rsi (Momentum)
  - Indicates overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Important to watch for divergences against the trend for early warning signals, especially in volatile NFLX moves.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - The 20-period middle band acts as a dynamic baseline for price movement. Useful for detecting breakouts, mean-reversion tendencies, and the context of price riding the band in strong trends.
- atr (Volatility)
  - Quantifies market volatility, guiding risk management (stop levels, position sizing). NFLX often experiences volatility spikes around earnings and product launches; ATR helps adjust risk accordingly.

What I will analyze once data is available (detailed, nuanced trends)
- Trend alignment across timeframes
  - Check if the 10 EMA crosses above/below 50 SMA and whether both are above/below the 200 SMA. Positive alignment (short and mid-term above long-term) would support bullish bias; persistent negative alignment would support bearish bias.
- Momentum signals
  - MACD and MACD Signal crossovers: bullish cross when MACD crosses above its signal line; bearish cross when it crosses below. Look for convergence/divergence with price highs/lows for early trend-change signals.
- Price vs. indicators
  - RSI levels around 70/30 with potential divergences against price action. In a strong uptrend, RSI can stay elevated; look for confirmations from MACD and price structure to avoid false signals.
- Volatility and breakout context
  - Bollinger middle band as a dynamic baseline; price riding the upper/lower bands can indicate persistent momentum or impending reversals when paired with ATR shifts.
  - ATR values to gauge position sizing and stop distances; rising ATR suggests increasing risk, while contracting ATR suggests consolidation.
- Risk-managed entry/exit frameworks
  - Use ATR for stop placement, and combine with MA crossovers and MACD signals to time entries with protective exits in case momentum fades.

Note on next steps
- Once the data retrieval system returns NFLX data, I will generate all eight indicators for the chosen date range (back to at least 2024-01-01) and deliver:
  - A detailed, data-backed trend interpretation
  - Signals and their confidence levels (e.g., which indicators agree/disagree)
  - Optional trading scenarios (entry/exit ideas) with risk considerations
  - A concise, tabular summary of key observations and signals

Markdown table: summary of proposed indicators and roles
| Indicator | Category | Purpose | What to look for (signal notes) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages (short-term) | Momentum short-term, entry timing | Cross above/below price or 50 SMA; quick momentum shifts |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages (mid-term) | Trend confirmation, dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50 SMA; cross with 10 EMA for early signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages (long-term) | Overall trend direction, strategic bias | Price above/below 200 SMA; golden/death cross with shorter MA signals |
| macd | MACD | Momentum shift, trend change signals | MACD line vs. signal line cross; divergence with price highs/lows |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD; confirmation | Crosses with MACD for entry/exit triggers; filter with other indicators |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context, reversals | RSI approaching 70/30; look for divergences and trend alignment |
| boll | Volatility baseline | Breakout/reversion context around middle band | Price interaction with middle/bands; band riding in strong trends |
| atr | Volatility | Risk management, stop placement | Rising ATR implies wider stops; use to adjust position sizing and risk |

Current status
- Data retrieval from the tools is currently failing due to a FileNotFoundError. I’m ready to retry once the data source is available, or you can provide an alternative data window or a specific date to fetch. If you’d like, I can attempt a minimal retry pass or wait for a system fix and then deliver the full, data-backed analysis with the eight indicators above.
