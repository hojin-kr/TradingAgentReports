I attempted to fetch PLTR data and compute the indicators, but the data retrieval failed due to an environment error (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data tool. I can retry fetching the data, or you can approve alternate dates or a shorter window. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a concise plan and a recommended set of indicators you can expect to provide complementary, non-redundant insights for PLTR under typical market conditions.

Recommended indicator set (max 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance. Helps gauge whether price is above/below the mid-term trend.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming the overarching trend and spotting golden/death cross setups with other signals.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum; can flag quick shifts. Best used with longer-term averages to filter noise.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Momentum trend changes via MACD line crossovers; provides a lagged but robust signal when aligned with other filters.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: MACD Signal line; crossovers with MACD line act as clearer entry/exit triggers within the broader MACD framework.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Histogram shows momentum strength and potential divergences; helpful to spot early momentum shifts, especially in sideways markets.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Why: Momentum scale and overbought/oversold signals; watch for divergence with price and confirm with trends.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Why: Measures market volatility; informs risk management, stop placement, and position sizing; helps scale expectations during high/low volatility regimes.

Context notes
- This set covers: trend direction (50/200 SMA), momentum (10EMA, MACD components, RSI), momentum strength (MACD histogram), and risk management (ATR). It provides a balanced view that can adapt to trending vs. range-bound periods often seen with growth/information technology stocks like PLTR.
- If you have a specific trading style (e.g., swing trading vs. longer-term investing) or a preferred time horizon, I can tailor the indicator mix (e.g., replace RSI with Stochastic RSI or include VWMA for volume-confirmed moves).

Next steps
- I will retry fetching the PLTR data and compute the indicators once the data source is accessible. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry with the same window (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-28) or
  - Use a shorter window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to get quicker signals, or
  - Adjust look_back_days (e.g., 20–60 days) to fit a particular trading horizon.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry data fetch with the original date range
- Retry with a shorter date range (e.g., last 6–12 months)
- Retry with a different look_back_days (e.g., 20, 60)
- Or specify a different date range or horizon

Provisional interpretation framework (to apply once data is available)
- Trend alignment: If price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA and 10EMA is above 50SMA, expect bullish bias; cross below can indicate a shift.
- Momentum signals: MACD line crossing above MACD signal (and MACD positive) supports long entries; MACD histogram rising confirms strengthening momentum; RSI near 60–70 suggests room for upside but watch for overbought risk.
- Volatility risk: ATR rising indicates increasing volatility and larger potential stop ranges; adjust position sizing accordingly.
- Signal confirmation: Prefer trades where MACD momentum signals align with price above major moving averages and RSI is not in extreme overbought territory.

| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret signals | Trade signal cue (example) |
|-----------|----------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA → bullish bias; below → bearish bias | Price above 50SMA and 10EMA above 50SMA → potential long setup |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA → long-term uptrend; below → long-term downtrend | Golden cross with 10EMA crossing above 50SMA strengthens bullish case |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; signals can be noisy in choppy markets | 10EMA crossing above 50SMA in uptrend supports entries; cross back below is a warning |
| macd | MACD | Momentum trend changes | MACD line crossing above signal with positive value is bullish; below is bearish | MACD bullish cross + price above major SMAs → consider long entry |
| macds | MACD | MACD signal line | Crosses with MACD line confirm momentum shifts | MACD cross above signal corroborates MACD bullish stance |
| macdh | MACD | Momentum strength and divergence | Increasing histogram implies rising momentum; negative/declining implies weakening momentum | Rising macdh with price above SMAs supports long bias; diverging from price warns risk |
| rsi | Momentum | Relative momentum; overbought/oversold | RSI >70 overbought; <30 oversold; tendency to revert; watch for divergence | RSI rising toward 70 in uptrend supports continuation; bearish divergence warns reversal |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility and risk framework | Higher ATR means wider price swings; informs stop and position sizing | Rising ATR → widen stops; price breakouts with high ATR more volatile but potentially stronger |

Status: Data fetch currently blocked by environment error
- I can retry immediately or after you confirm preferred parameters (dates, horizon, or an alternative data window). Once data is retrieved, I’ll generate a complete, data-driven report with precise indicator readings, trend alignment, and actionable trade implications for PLTR.
