Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based stock sentiment for PLTR over 2025-09-22 to 2025-09-28, but I hit an internal tool error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data pull, or we can proceed with an analysis using other sources in parallel (e.g., other social platforms and recent news). Here’s how I can proceed right now and what I’ll deliver once the data comes through.

What I can do now
- Retry Reddit-based sentiment pulls for PLTR for the requested dates as soon as the tool is available again.
- In parallel, pull and synthesize sentiment and news from alternative sources (e.g., X/Twitter discussions, Stocktwits, major news outlets) if you’d like a broader view while we wait for Reddit data.
- Compile a comprehensive, trader-focused report that triangulates social sentiment, recent company news, and potential price drivers.

Proposed structure of the long-form report (to deliver once data is gathered)
1) Executive Summary
   - High-level sentiment directional read for the past week.
   - Key catalysts and risks likely driving sentiment and price.

2) Social Sentiment Overview
   - Overall tone (positive/neutral/negative) across sources.
   - Volume trends and notable spikes (date-by-date context).
   - Dominant themes and chatter (e.g., AI capabilities, Foundry adoption, government/commercial mix, earnings expectations).

3) Daily Sentiment Analysis (past 7 days)
   - Day-by-day sentiment scores.
   - Top recurring narratives by day.
   - Any converging or diverging signals from different sources.

4) Key Narrative Drivers
   - Palantir Foundry and AI product momentum (customer wins, use cases, retention).
   - Government/defense contracts and public sector growth vs. commercial verticals.
   - Margin trajectory, guidance, and comments from management.
   - Competitive landscape and investor concerns (dilution, capex, capital structure).

5) News & Events (past 7 days)
   - Summary of notable news items (earnings, partnerships, product announcements, regulatory or policy updates).
   - How news aligns with or contradicts sentiment.

6) Risk Assessment
   - What the sentiment is signaling about potential downside/upside risks.
   - Market macro considerations that could amplify or dampen PLTR moves.

7) Trading Implications & Scenarios
   - Bullish, bearish, and neutral scenarios with key triggers.
   - Short-term ideas (e.g., setup-based trades around catalysts) and risk controls.

8) Data Quality & Methodology
   - Sources used, note on data gaps, and any caveats about sentiment signals.

Appendix: Markdown table (to be filled once data is available)
- I’ll append a table like this at the end of the final report to organize key points clearly.

Table (example skeleton; final version will be populated with actual data)
- Date | Source | Sentiment Tone (Positive/Neutral/Negative) | Notable Themes/Narratives | Major News/Events | Potential Market Impact
- 2025-09-22 | Reddit | Positive | Foundry expansion, AI demos | Press release on new client win | Possible upside sentiment push
- 2025-09-23 | Reddit | Neutral | Caution on valuation, growth pace | Analyst notes update | Mixed impact
- 2025-09-24 | Reddit | Negative | Cost concerns, guidance below expectations | Earnings-related chatter | Potential downside risk
- 2025-09-25 | Reddit | Positive | Government contracts resilience | New contract rumor | Upside risk if confirmed
- 2025-09-26 | Reddit | Neutral | Software adoption steady | Product update announced | Neutral-to-slight upside
- 2025-09-27 | Reddit | Positive | AI/ML capabilities garner interest | Management interview clip | Moderate upside
- 2025-09-28 | Reddit | (to be filled) | (to be filled) | (to be filled) | (to be filled)

Next steps
- Tell me if you’d like me to retry the Reddit data pull now, or proceed with an analysis based on available alternative sources (which I can start immediately).
- If you prefer, I can draft a complete report now using a robust framework and placeholders for Reddit data, then replace placeholders once the Reddit feed returns.

Would you like me to:
A) Retry the Reddit data pull for PLTR now, or
B) Proceed with a comprehensive analysis using other sources in the meantime?
