Recommendation: SELL NVDA (with a plan to trim and de-risk, and use hedges until a more favorable setup develops).

Rationale
- Valuation risk remains meaningful. NVDA trades at a premium multiple tied to a long AI cycle; a slower-growth or shorter-than-expected AI capex backdrop could compress multiples and hurt returns.
- Cyclicality and macro sensitivity. IT spending correlates with broader macro cycles; a wobble in IT capex or risk-off episodes can disproportionately impact high-valuation tech names.
- Regulatory/geopolitical tailwinds and headwinds. China exposure and export-control dynamics pose potential demand constraints and supply-chain/friction risks that can reprice earnings power.
- Execution/margin and mix risk. Any data-center mix shift or ramp challenges could pressure margins even if AI adoption remains strong, especially if supply/demand dynamics diverge from expectations.
- The bear catalysts are credible and not purely speculative, and the plan’s emphasis on risk controls remains prudent in a high-valuation, high-beta AI name.

Strategic actions (dos and don’ts)
- Trim to a small sleeve (target ~2–3% of the portfolio, or your predefined risk threshold). Lock in gains and reduce exposure to episodic shocks.
- Implement a defined downside hedge for residual exposure:
  - Long dated protective puts on NVDA to cap downside, or
  - A collar (puts buying vs calls selling) to reduce net cost while limiting upside.
- Reallocate freed capital to diversified AI exposure with lower idiosyncratic risk:
  - Consider broad AI/tech exposure (MSFT, GOOG/Alphabet, CRM/ServiceNow with AI tilt) or AI-focused ETFs to maintain AI exposure without single-name concentration.
- Re-entry triggers for NVDA (if you want to re-engage later):
  - Look for a meaningful drawdown (e.g., 15–25%) plus constructive signals (improving backlog/margin trajectory, technicals showing stabilization above key supports and moving averages).
  - Re-entry should be staged and conditional on multiple signals aligning (momentum backing a sustainable uptrend, improving margins, and visible catalysts).
- Ongoing risk monitoring:
  - Watch data-center demand signals, AI monetization progress, regulatory headlines, and macro IT spending indicators.
  - Be prepared to pivot quickly if catalysts turn negative or if the stock breaks meaningful support on high-volume downside.

Notes
- The plan you provided is aligned with defensive risk management. If you want, I can tailor this further to your exact position size, risk limits, hedging preferences, and time horizon, or run scenarios (e.g., NVDA drop scenarios with hedges and P/L outcomes).
