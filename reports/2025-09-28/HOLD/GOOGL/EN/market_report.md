I attempted to fetch GOOG/GOOGL data and run the requested indicators, but the data retrieval service returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t access price data for GOOG/GOOGL right now to produce a live trend read. If you’d like, I can either retry shortly, or proceed with a robust framework using placeholder data and focusing on how to interpret the indicators once the data is available. Below is a detailed plan with a carefully chosen set of indicators that provide complementary insights for GOOGL, along with how to read them once you have the actual data.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll

Why this combination is suitable for GOOGL today
- Trend confirmation with multiple timeframes: close_50_sma and close_200_sma give medium- and long-term trend context. When price sits above both, the bias is bullish; when below, bearish. The cross of 50 below/above 200 can signal major regime shifts (crossovers like golden/death cross) useful for strategic positioning.
- Responsive momentum and entry timing: close_10_ema captures near-term momentum shifts and can help with faster entry/exit framing in conjunction with longer-term trends.
- Momentum confirmation and signal robustness: macd, macds, and macdh together provide momentum direction, signal timing, and strength. Crossovers of MACD with its signal line, as well as rising/histogram expansion, reinforce or warn against false signals in choppy markets.
- Momentum/overbought-oversold framing: rsI adds a momentum context with clear overbought/oversold thresholds (commonly 70/30) and divergence signals that can precede reversals, especially when aligned with price position relative to the moving averages.
- Volatility/volatility-based envelopes: boll (Bollinger Middle) gives a dynamic baseline plus context for breakouts and reversals when price interacts with upper/lower bands. In high-volatility regimes, Boll bands help filter entries and exits by indicating potential breakouts or mean-reversion zones.
- Practical risk and position sizing companion: Though not strictly a volatility kick-off, the combination with ATR-based sizing would be an excellent follow-on. If you’d like, I can add ATR later when data access is restored.

How to interpret signals when data is available (conceptual guidance)
- Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA with 50/200 cross bullish: suggests a favorable macro/trend regime; look for pullbacks toward the 50SMA or 10EMA as potential entry points if momentum confirms.
- Price below both SMAs with a bearish MACD setup: reinforces downside bias; prefer risk controls and wait for a bullish MACD reversal before taking long exposure.
- MACD cross above signal line (MACD > MACDS) with expanding MACDH (histogram rising): bullish momentum confirmation; ideal to align with price above 10EMA.
- RSI rising from the 30–40 region toward mid-range (or higher) while price breaks above resistance or 50SMA: momentum confirmation; watch for overbought levels near 70; if RSI is diverging from price, insulate with risk management.
- RSI divergence with price: potential reversal signal; confirm with MACD and price position relative to Boll middle and bands.
- Price touching or crossing Boll upper band with MACD/MAS confirming strength can indicate a strong up-move, but may also warn of exhaustion if RSI is overbought or histogram loses momentum.
- Price testing Boll lower band with MACD histogram turning positive and RSI rising: potential mean-reversion setup or a short-term reversal to the upside if confirmed by the 10EMA.
- ATR-driven risk awareness: not listed in the core 8 here, but once data access is restored, pairing ATR with position sizing will help manage stops in volatile moves flagged by Boll bands and MACD dynamics.

What I need from you to complete a live, fully-detailed read
- Restore access to price data for GOOGL/GOOG (or confirm a data source you’d like me to use).
- Once data is available, I’ll fetch the indicators, compute current values, and deliver:
  - A live trend/read of each indicator
  - The current alignment of all eight indicators
  - A granular, step-by-step set of actionable trading ideas (entries, exits, stops, risk management) based on the combined signal confluence
  - A concise, trader-focused narrative describing regime, momentum, volatility, and risk outlook for the next trading window

Proposed final deliverable structure (once data is present)
- Executive snapshot: overall trend, momentum, volatility read
- Indicator-by-indicator notes: what the current value suggests and how it interacts with other indicators
- Trade scenarios: if signals align bullish, bearish, or mixed, with recommended actions and risk controls
- Visual interpretation tips: quick heuristics for quick decision-making in a live session
- Markdown table (summary of indicators and signals)

Markdown table: Key indicators, what they measure, and typical signals
| Indicator | What it measures | Typical signal interpretation (GOOGL context) |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average (mid-term trend) | Price above: bullish bias; price below: bearish bias; use as dynamic support/resistance |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average (long-term trend) | Price above: long-term uptrend; price below: long-term downtrend; golden/death cross relevance for regime shifts |
| close_10_ema | 10-day exponential moving average (short-term momentum) | Price above: short-term bullish momentum; price below: short-term bearish momentum; use for timely entries |
| macd | MACD line (momentum) | Positive/expanding MACD suggests bullish momentum; negative/contracting suggests bearish momentum; cross with MACDS signals entry timing |
| macds | MACD signal line (smoothing) | Crosses with MACD to generate buy/sell signals; confirms MACD-origin momentum shifts |
| macdh | MACD histogram (momentum strength) | Rising histogram: strengthening momentum; falling: weakening momentum; divergence can precede reversals |
| rsi | Relative Strength Index (momentum/overbought-oversold) | >70 overbought, <30 oversold; watch for divergences and cross-check with trend indicators |
| boll | Bollinger Middle (20-SMA baseline for volatility) | Price riding the middle line indicates standard behavior; moves toward/through upper band suggest breakout strength; lower band implies potential mean reversion with context from MACD/RSI |

Next steps
- If you can re-run the data fetch (or provide the data), I’ll generate the live numeric readings for GO OGL/GOOGL, run the eight indicators, and deliver the full trend/trade-orientation report with specifics and a clear action plan.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a simulated-by-design example using representative values to illustrate how the interpretation would look, but please note that it will not reflect the actual current market state.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry data retrieval now and continue with an actual live analysis, or
- Proceed with a hypothetical framework and example signals, or
- Supply your own data for me to analyze.
