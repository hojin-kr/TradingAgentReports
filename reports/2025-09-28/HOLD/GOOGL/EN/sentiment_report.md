Sorry about that — I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment for GOOGL, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the Reddit data fetcher is currently failing on my end.

Here are your options to move forward:
- Retry now: I can try the Reddit sentiment fetch again immediately.
- Proceed without Reddit data for now: I’ll draft a thorough long-form report focusing on other available signals (e.g., recent news coverage, market sentiment from other sources, historical context) and leave placeholders for Reddit sentiment to be filled in once the tool is back.
- Alternative sources: If you have other sources you want me to monitor (e.g., Twitter/X, major news outlets, earnings call quotes), I can incorporate them right away.

What would you prefer? If you’d like, I can retry the Reddit fetch now and start assembling the full report as soon as I have that data.
