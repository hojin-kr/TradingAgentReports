I’m running into an internal tool error trying to fetch Reddit data for QQQ on 2025-09-28. The error is a FileNotFoundError from the Reddit info fetcher. It looks like a backend issue rather than something on your end. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

Options
1) Retry now: I can attempt to fetch the Reddit data again immediately to continue the full social-media/ sentiment + news analysis.
2) Proceed without Reddit data for now: I can build a comprehensive report focusing on other public sentiment signals and recent news that typically drive QQQ (ETF-level macro drivers, tech-sector news, earnings milieu for top-weighted holdings, flows, etc.). I’ll clearly note where Reddit data would have informed the analysis and what I expect to see once the tool is back.
3) Wait and run a broader, two-step analysis: I’ll start with a high-signal, Reddit-agnostic analysis now, then re-run the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is healthy and append the Reddit-specific findings to the report.

What I can deliver now (regardless of Reddit data availability)
- An ETF-focused sentiment and news analysis for QQQ over the past week, highlighting:
  - Macro and market conditions impacting tech-heavy ETFs (rates, macro risk appetite, inflation expectations, geopolitical factors).
  - News affecting the ETF indirectly through its top holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, etc.) and how those stories could influence QQQ’s price action.
  - Typical drivers for QQQ: earnings season cadence, AI/tech hype cycles, regulatory considerations, flows into/ out of U.S. tech ETFs, and options activity context.
  - Risk factors and potential catalysts for the next 1–2 weeks (volatility catalysts, sector leadership shifts, and notable earnings/tech news).

- A detailed, trader-oriented interpretation:
  - How sentiment shifts in tech leaders could translate into ETF moves.
  - What a bullish or bearish Reddit/retail sentiment posture would imply for risk tolerance and positioning in QQQ.
  - Key technical levels to watch on QQQ (support/resistance zones commonly cited by traders, and how macro data could impact those levels).

- A Markdown table at the end that summarizes key points, risk factors, and near-term catalysts (to be filled with concrete Reddit findings once the tool is back).

Proposed next step
- Tell me which option you prefer (retry now, proceed without Reddit data, or wait and run a two-step process). If you’d like, I can start with the Reddit-agnostic analysis immediately and then append Reddit-specific insights as soon as the tool becomes available again.

Would you like me to retry fetching Reddit data now, or should I proceed with the Reddit-agnostic comprehensive analysis in the meantime?
