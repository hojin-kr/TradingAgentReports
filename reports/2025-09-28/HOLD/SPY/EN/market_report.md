I attempted to fetch SPY data for 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-28, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a temporary data access issue on the server side, not a problem with SPY or your date range. I can’t generate the detailed trend report yet until the data service is back online. I can proceed in two ways right now:
- Option A: I proceed with selecting the most relevant indicators (without the trend narrative) and outline how I’d interpret them once data is available. Then I’ll run the full analysis as soon as the data fetch succeeds.
- Option B: You wait and I retry the data fetch now and deliver the full, data-driven report immediately after a successful retrieval.

Below is a robust, complementary 8-indicator setup I would use for SPY in this context, along with why each is suitable. This gives you a ready-to-run framework for when data access is restored.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Why these 8 indicators work well together for SPY
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages, Medium-term trend)
  - Purpose: Identify the main trend direction and dynamic support/resistance over a medium horizon.
  - Why SPY: SPY tends to follow broad market cycles; the 50-day SMA helps filter noise and align with a mid-term trend view.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages, Long-term trend)
  - Purpose: Confirm the overarching market regime (bullish/bearish) and flag long-term trend reversals or confirmations (golden/death cross possibilities).
  - Why SPY: Important for understanding major regime context and for aligning entries with longer-term flows.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages, Short-term momentum)
  - Purpose: Capture quicker shifts in momentum and potential entry points, acting as a fast-responding signal when used with longer MAs.
  - Why SPY: Can help detect early momentum changes around macro announcements or earnings season swings.
- macd (MACD)
  - Purpose: Momentum determination via crossovers of the MACD line and signal line; visualizes changes in trend strength.
  - Why SPY: Widely used for trend-following entries/exits; helpful in confirming the direction suggested by price and other indicators.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Purpose: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with the MACD line to trigger signals.
  - Why SPY: Adds an extra layer to reduce false positives from MACD swings, especially in choppy periods.
- rsi (Momentum)
  - Purpose: Measure momentum and identify potential overbought/oversold conditions (commonly using 70/30 thresholds) and divergence.
  - Why SPY: Useful to spot reversals or fade moves in conjunction with trend signals, though in strong trends RSI can stay extended.
- atr (Volatility)
  - Purpose: Measure current market volatility to guide risk management, position sizing, and stop placement.
  - Why SPY: Volatility often expands around macro news; ATR helps scale risk appropriately and avoid tight stops in volatile regimes.
- vwma (Volume-Based)
  - Purpose: Confirm trends with price action that occurs on higher-than-average volume; validates moves with market participation.
  - Why SPY: Volume-backed confirmation is crucial in a widely traded ETF where price moves can be volume-driven or noise-driven.

How I would interpret these together (when data is available)
- Bullish setup indicators
  - Price trading above 50 and 200 SMAs with 50 cross above 200 (if it occurs), 10-EMA trending higher, MACD above signal, RSI rising but not yet overbought, ATR showing manageable volatility, VWMA rising with price.
- Bearish setup indicators
  - Price below 50 and 200 SMAs, 10-EMA trending down, MACD below signal, RSI drifting toward 30s, ATR rising signaling higher risk, VWMA weakening with price.
- Neutral/transition setups
  - Price oscillating near MAs, MACD lines crossing around zero with modest RSI activity, ATR moderate, VWMA mixed with price, indicating potential range consolidation.

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry the data fetch now (Option A) and deliver a fully data-driven, trend-focused SPY report as soon as it succeeds?
- Or would you prefer I proceed with Option B (retry later and keep you posted), plus provide the full 8-indicator analysis once data is retrieved?
