Recommendation: Hold SPY for now.

Rationale
- The bull case remains plausible on durability of large-cap leadership, but breadth is not broad enough to support a confident full allocation without confirmation. Valuations are elevated relative to rate expectations, and a macro regime with higher-for-longer rates or inflation surprises could compress multiples.
- Technicals are mixed: SPY has shown resilience, but a clear, durable buy signal typically requires broad-based participation and a confirming macro backdrop. Right now, breadth signals and macro data need to align more convincingly before committing to a full overweight.
- Risk controls are prudent: a measured hedging stance helps guard against a regime shift while preserving optionality for a future upgrade if breadth and macro data improve.

Operational plan (today)
- Core exposure posture: Maintain neutral-to-slightly-underweight SPY; avoid aggressive new long allocations without confirmation.
- Hedging: Implement a modest hedge to protect downside:
  - Example: Buy SPY puts 1–3% of portfolio value, 1–2 months out, 5–10% OTM, or use a small VIX hedging sleeve.
  - Position sizing: cap individual hedges to 2–3% of portfolio value.
- Tactical tilt rules (confirmations needed to upgrade to Buy):
  - Price action: SPY above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages.
  - Breadth: a broad-based breadth improvement (e.g., >60% of stocks above their 50-day moving average, rising new highs).
  - Momentum: MACD bullish cross, RSI in constructive range (not overbought).
  - Macro: inflation trending lower and rate path data supportive.
- Entry/exit triggers:
  - Upgrade to Buy: above conditions, with supportive volume and improving breadth.
  - Trim/defensive shift: if SPY breaks below the 50-day on high volume or breadth deteriorates meaningfully, reduce exposure and/or increase hedges; consider defensive sectors or raising cash.
- Monitoring cadence:
  - Weekly quick review focused on breadth, moving-average relationships, and macro data; daily checks for regime-shift signals (volume spikes, VIX movement, breadth deterioration).
- Learning and discipline:
  - Rely on multiple signals (price action, breadth, macro) rather than a single indicator.
  - Maintain clear triggers and keep liquidity for a potential breadth-confirming dip or macro relief rally.

Bottom line
- Hold SPY now with risk controls in place. Be prepared to upgrade to a Buy if breadth and macro signals align and price confirms above key moving averages. If conditions deteriorate, shift toward hedged cash or defensive exposure to preserve capital.
