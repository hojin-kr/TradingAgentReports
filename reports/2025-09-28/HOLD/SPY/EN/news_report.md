Thanks for the prompt. A quick note: I attempted to pull Finnhub data for SPY (2025-09-21 to 2025-09-28) but the Finnhub tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I did obtain a broad Google News feed (dated 2025-09-28) that provides macro-relevant signals and thematic drivers. I’ll synthesize a comprehensive view using the accessible signals and general macro/trading context, and I’ll clearly mark where data is inferred from signals rather than firm price/flow data.

Executive summary
- The week’s narrative for SPY remains data-dependent and risk-sensitive. The signal mix is non-uniform: geopolitical and AI/tech-portfolio themes are prominent, while inflation and growth surprises continue to be the anchor of risk appetite.
- Market drivers appear to be shifting between growth-supportive themes (AI/semis, capex, energy transition) and risk-off pressure from geopolitics and persistent inflation concerns. This is consistent with a market that tolerates gradual risk-on in certain tech/AI names yet remains sensitive to macro surprises and policy cues.
- In this environment, SPY-plateau behavior is likely to hinge on: (1) inflation trajectory and labor market health; (2) Fed communications and policy expectations; (3) global growth signals (China/Europe) and energy/commodity price moves; (4) geopolitical risk sentiment and supply-chain resilience; (5) AI/tech earnings and semiconductor supply/demand dynamics.
- The current signal set leans toward mixed-to-positive risk appetite on tech/AI expectations but with an elevated caution bar due to geopolitical and mineral-supply considerations.

Global macro backdrop (context for SPY)
- Inflation and policy: The ongoing data-dependence regime means any cooler-than-expected inflation print or a softer-than-feared growth print could keep rate-hike expectations anchored at a gradual tightening-to-hold stance, with later-cut potential depending on the trajectory of core inflation and labor market slack.
- Growth and earnings: Broad U.S. earnings resilience, especially from large-cap tech and select consumer-facing names, can support SPY, even as cyclical sectors show more variability. The health of consumer demand and capex will be key to the breadth of a rally beyond defensives.
- Geopolitics and minerals: Signals around critical minerals (energy transition supply chains) and ongoing geopolitical frictions may inject intermittent volatility and a higher risk premium. Positive breakthroughs or resolutions could provide upside, while disorder or sanctions narratives could compress multiples in risk-on trades.
- AI/tech cycle: AI-related capital expenditure and semiconductor supply/demand dynamics remain a major driver for tech leadership within SPY. Positive earnings trends or industrial adoption signals tend to lift the technology-heavy segments of the S&P 500, which in turn helps SPY.

Markets and SPY implications (week-to-week read)
- Risk sentiment: The week’s signals show a tug-of-war between risk-on AI/tech optimism and risk-off geopolitics/mineral-supply concerns. Expect SPY to remain within a range unless a clear macro catalyst (inflation data, Fed messaging, or a geopolitical breakthrough) provides a directional push.
- Sector rotation: If AI/semis and software-driven growth themes stay in focus, expect better performance from tech-equity proxies within the SPY ecosystem (e.g., the tech-heavy end of the S&P 500) and related risk-on vibes for growth-oriented parts of the index. If inflation data remains sticky or geopolitical risks flare, defensives (consumer staples, utilities, healthcare) could outperform.
- Commodities and energy: Energy price moves can meaningfully affect SPY via the energy sector and broader economic signals. A sustained rally in oil could support energy exposure within SPY’s mix but may dampen consumer-spending margins if gasoline/petrol costs rise for households.

US market structure and what traders should watch (granular, actionable)
- Inflation and payrolls: Watch the core inflation series and wage growth. A cooling trend supports multiple rate-path scenarios (pause-to-cut later in 2025); a sticky core could pressure valuations and keep multiples compressed, especially for high-PE tech names within SPY.
- Fed communications: Any nuance around data dependence, balance sheet runoff, or policy accommodation will influence SPY. Markets tend to favor clarity that supports a decelerating path to rate cuts if inflation cools.
- Global growth signals: China and Europe data releases matter for the global growth backdrop, influencing spillovers into U.S. equities. Positive surprises can lift SPY on a risk-on tilt; negative surprises can trigger a risk-off move.
- Geopolitical risk and minerals: Signals on critical minerals and supplier tensions can cause swings in sectoral weights (e.g., materials, industrials) and in the overall SPY composition via earnings revisions and risk premia.

Sector-by-sector implications (high-level, cross-cutting)
- Tech/AI and communication services: Primary beneficiary if the AI investment cycle remains robust and supply chains stabilize. Expect outperformance within SPY’s tech-heavy components if margins stay healthy and capex remains resilient.
- Financials: Sensitive to rates and credit conditions. A constructive rate path supports bank profitability but may be tempered if macro uncertainty rises. Financials typically offer defensive ballast during risk-off phases.
- Consumer discretionary and staples: Discretionary remains tied to household confidence and real income trends; staples can offer relative resilience in choppier environments.
- Industrials and energy: Industrial capex and energy-sector dynamics can drive rotations; a constructive macro backdrop supports cyclicals, while geopolitical or supply constraints can cause volatility in energy and materials stocks.
- Healthcare: Generally more resilient in uncertain macro regimes; could provide ballast if risk appetite weakens.

Key catalysts and risk scenarios (for planning)
- Base case (2–6 week horizon): Inflation cools gradually; Fed maintains data-dependence with a potential rate-hold stance; AI/tech earnings surprise to the upside modestly; geopolitics remain a watchful risk. SPY trends gently higher with a widened but contained range.
- Bull case: Clear signs of sustained inflation retreat, favorable earnings revisions in tech/AI, and a geopolitical détente. SPY breaks out of resistance bands in the tech-heavy sectors, broadening gains across the index.
- Bear case: Sticky inflation, weaker-than-expected growth, or a geopolitical shock raises risk premia. SPY experiences corrective moves, with leadership shifting toward defensives and earnings revisions turning modestly negative in cyclicals.

Trade ideas and risk controls (practical for the week)
- If price action shows resilience in the tech growth subset of SPY, consider tactical overweight to SPY-related tech exposure through sub-portfolio tilts or related sector ETFs within the SPY framework, while using tight stops on breakouts to protect against reversal.
- In a risk-off reaction, focus on downside protection via hedges or defensive tilts (e.g., healthcare/consumer staples proxies) within the SPY exposure, while monitoring macro data for a potential reversion to risk-on.
- Manage macro risk with core risk controls: keep position sizing modest, use volatility filters (e.g., VIX-leaning indicators), and implement stop levels or trailing stops to limit drawdown during geopolitical or data surprise events.
- Data-gaps note: With Finnhub data temporarily unavailable, rely on sentiment proxies (options markets, ETF flows, volatility indices) and macro data releases to guide positioning.

Data gaps and next steps
- Once Finnhub data access is restored, I’ll pull the latest SPY-related headlines and sentiment signals for 2025-09-21 to 2025-09-28 to augment this analysis with a more granular, stock-level news lens (e.g., components of SPY showing the strongest/upward revisions vs. the weakest).
- I’ll also integrate EODHD coverage and any other available macro feeds you prefer to ensure a complete picture of SPY-specific news flows and macro events.

Markdown table: Key takeaways, catalysts, and trade ideas
- Note: The table summarizes the above in a compact view for quick reference.

|---|---|---|---|
| Inflation and policy path | Data-dependent inflation trends with potential for a hold/cut path later in 2025 | If inflation cools, more room for rate cuts; SPY upside supported by multiple expansion on lower discount rates | Build modest long exposure in SPY during confirmed inflation cooling signals; hedge against data shocks with tight stops |
| AI/tech earnings and capex | AI/tech investment cycle remains a growth driver; semis supply/demand dynamics matter | Tech leadership within SPY can lift broad index; keep watch on margins and capex data | Favor tech/AI-leaning components within SPY exposure; rotate into defensives if earnings surprises disappoint |
| Geopolitics and minerals | Mineral supply chains and geopolitical tensions create intermittent volatility | Geopolitical risk premium can cap upside and trigger downside spikes | Use hedges or options to manage tail risk; diversify across sectors to reduce single-name risk |
| Global growth signals | China/Europe data and energy price moves influence SPY via risk sentiment | Positive global growth signals support SPY; negative/uncertain growth hurts | Avoid large directional bets on any single data miss; maintain balanced exposure with risk controls |
| Market structure and flows | Signals from options markets and ETF flows can hint at near-term risk appetite | If volatility remains contained, SPY tends to drift with macro data; if volatility spikes, risk-off likely | Monitor VIX-like indicators and SPY options activity for timing entries/exits; use small- to mid-sized position adjustments |

If you’d like, I can re-run with fresh Finnhub data as soon as the tool is available again and deliver an updated, stock-level SPY news digest alongside the macro synthesis.
