Verdict: HOLD TSLA today.

Rationale
- The provided plan centers on a data-driven Hold due to a lack of live, confirmatory signals across the eight indicators. Given near-term risks (valuation, competition, policy shifts) and no decisive trend confirmation, initiating new long exposure would overweight uncertain upside.
- A Hold stance preserves capital while allowing the thesis (long-run software monetization, energy/scale benefits) to play out only if multi-indicator validation appears.

Actionable steps now
- Immediate stance: Do not add new TSLA exposure today. If already long, consider modestly reducing size or maintaining current allocation with hedging.
- Data-driven confirmation: Await the TSLA eight-indicator readings. Reassess and potentially re-enter on a confirmed bullish setup (e.g., price above key moving averages with constructive MACD/RSI, rising volume).
- Risk controls: Use ATR-based stops for any new long exposure (e.g., 1.5xâ€“2x ATR below entry). Consider progressive trimming or tight stops if price action deteriorates.
- Hedging if already long: Protective put or collar to limit downside while keeping upside optionality.
- Catalysts to monitor: Deliveries, ASP/mix shifts, FSD/subscription uptake, energy deployments, and capacity ramp progress; macro/policy signals affecting EV demand.

Decision framework going forward
- Bullish trigger to Buy: clear, multi-indicator trend confirmation plus tangible monetization progress and margin trajectory support.
- Bearish trigger to Sell/accelerate risk reduction: sustained trend deterioration, weak monetization signals, and deteriorating competitive/policy backdrop.

Conclusion
- The plan emphasizes a disciplined, data-driven upgrade from Hold only when the indicators align and fundamentals validate a durable uptrend. For now, Hold is prudent and aligns with risk controls and the current information set.

Would you prefer I proceed with Option B (hold-ready plan and slot in data when it lands) and I deliver a live verdict as soon as the TSLA indicator data becomes available?

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
