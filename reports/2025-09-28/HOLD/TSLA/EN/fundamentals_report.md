I ran the requested data fetches for TSLA, but the backend tools returned a FileNotFoundError (no such file or directory). It looks like a temporary issue with the data connectors rather than your request. I can try again in a moment, or proceed with an alternative approach.

Options to proceed:
- Retry data retrieval now: I’ll attempt the insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin data (balance sheet, cash flow, income statement) again as soon as the backend is available.
- Proceed with a qualitative/structure-only report: I can deliver a thorough framework and analysis based on publicly known fundamentals up to the present, clearly labeled as not containing the latest tool-fed figures until data retrieval succeeds.
- Use alternative sources: I can pull data from other public sources or summarize what would be expected in each section, with explicit notes on data gaps if you’d like.

What would you prefer?
- Retry now
- Go ahead with a qualitative framework (no tool data yet)
- Combine: I can draft the framework plus a best-effort qualitative overview while I retry fetching the numeric data in the background.

If you want a heads-up on what the final report will include, here’s the structure I’ll deliver (once data is in):
- Company profile and business model (Tesla, Inc.)
- Recent financial snapshot (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) with period-by-period changes
- Trend analysis (revenue, margins, capex, liquidity, leverage) and quarterly/annual context
- Insider sentiment overview (tone, notable holders, directional bias)
- Insider transactions (nascent activity, notable purchases/sales, potential implications)
- Operational highlights (production capacity, model mix, energy/storage segments, price/competition)
- Cash flow quality and capital allocation signals
- Valuation-related context and risk factors
- A concise, reader-friendly Markdown table summarizing key points (metrics, signals, risks, and notes)

If you’d like me to proceed with a retry now, say “Retry now,” and I’ll kick off the data fetches and report back with the full, detailed fundamentals as soon as the data is retrieved.
