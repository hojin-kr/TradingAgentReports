I attempted to fetch TSLA data to compute the indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t generate the actual indicator values right now. If you’d like, I can retry once the data source is available, or proceed with a clear plan and a detailed interpretation framework using the chosen indicators so you’re ready to act as soon as data is retrieved.

Selected indicators for TSLA (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll_ub
- atr

Rationale for TSLA (high-volatility, momentum-driven EV/tech stock)
- Moving averages (close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema): TSLA often trades in dynamic ranges with trend-driven moves. The 50 and 200 SMAs provide medium- to long-term trend context and help identify major support/resistance zones. The 10 EMA adds a responsive view of near-term momentum, useful for catching quick shifts in price direction, especially around product-cycle news, earnings, or capacity/price announcements.
- MACD and MACD Signal (macd, macds): TSLA tends to exhibit momentum-driven moves. MACD crossovers and the MACD histogram can help identify shifts in momentum, particularly when price is near key levels or breaking out of consolidation.
- RSI (rsi): A momentum gauge that flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals or continuations in the presence of strong trends. For TSLA, RSI can stay extended during powerful rallies, so it should be interpreted alongside trend direction from MAs.
- Bollinger Upper Band (boll_ub): Provides a volatility-based gauge of overbought-like conditions and breakout zones. When price tests or rides the upper band during bullish moves, it may indicate strong momentum or potential pullbacks if accompanied by other overbought signals.
- ATR (atr): Measures volatility. Useful for sizing and risk management in a stock known for spikes on news or earnings. A rising ATR can warn of higher stop-loss ranges and wider price swings.

How the indicators would be interpreted for TSLA (once data is available)
- Trend context (50SMA, 200SMA, 10EMA)
  - Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA: bullish trend bias; look for pullbacks to dynamic support, potential entries on favorable momentum signals.
  - Price crossing below or failing to clear 50SMA/200SMA with a bearish cross of 10EMA below longer-term averages: potential trend reversal or consolidation phase; look for confirmation from MACD and RSI.
  - Golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) or death cross (50SMA crossing below 200SMA) would be significant macro-trend cues; use with MACD/RSI for confirmation.
- Momentum (MACD, MACD Signal)
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal line with positive histogram supports upside momentum; corroborate with price staying above short/medium-term MAs.
  - MACD divergence from price (e.g., price makes new highs while MACD makes lower highs) signals waning momentum and potential reversal; use RSI to assess overbought risk.
- Momentum Strength (RSI)
  - RSI trending toward overbought territory (e.g., >70) in a clearly uptrending context could indicate a pullback risk rather than immediate reversal; look for confirmation from MACD/price action.
  - RSI in oversold territory (<30) during a downtrend may indicate a potential bounce, especially if MACD shows positive momentum and price holds above key moving averages.
- Volatility and breakout risk (boll_ub, ATR)
  - Price pressing the Bollinger upper band with rising ATR suggests strong breakout momentum but with elevated risk of a pullback; risk controls warranted.
  - Rising ATR with a breakout above resistance or previous highs can imply more sustained moves, but use stop adjustments to manage larger swings.
- Trade management considerations
  - Use ATR to set initial stop-loss bands that respect current volatility (e.g., a multiple of ATR from entry).
  - Confirm breakouts or trend changes with at least two indicators (e.g., MACD momentum + price above 50SMA + RSI not in extreme overbought territory).

Next steps
- I will re-run the data fetch as soon as the data source is accessible and generate the eight indicators for TSLA. Then I’ll deliver:
  - A concise, data-backed trend verdict (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) with the exact readings and date stamps.
  - A structured entry/exit plan aligned with the indicators (where applicable), including suggested stop-loss and target ideas based on volatility.
  - A brief sensitivity check showing how changes in key indicators could alter the trade setup.

If you’d like me to proceed with a hypothetical example to illustrate how to read these indicators together, I can generate a simulated scenario and walk you through the decision process. Just say the word.

Markdown table: Key points and interpretation framework (to be filled with actual data after retrieval)

| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for TSLA | Action cues (with data) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance | | |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | | |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum signal | | |
| macd | Momentum difference via EMA convergence/divergence | | |
| macds | MACD signal line; smoothing for trigger | | |
| rsi | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold context | | |
| boll_ub | Upper Bollinger Band; breakout/overbought tone | | |
| atr | Market volatility level; risk sizing | | |

Notes
- I will populate the table with concrete readings and actionable signals once the data fetch succeeds.
- If you want me to try an alternate data source or a shorter date range to debug the tool error, I can do that next.
