Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock news for TSLA (2025-09-28) using the dedicated tool, but it returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data backend or a path the tool relies on is temporarily unavailable. I can’t retrieve Reddit-based sentiment data right this moment. I’ll outline exactly how I’ll proceed and what you’ll get as soon as the tool is working again, and I’ve also prepared a concrete plan you can review in the meantime.

What I can do right now (plan)
- Reattempt Reddit data pull for TSLA as soon as the Reddit tool is accessible again.
- Compile a comprehensive, trader-focused report combining:
  - Social sentiment: day-by-day sentiment signals from Reddit posts and threads, key topics, and notable spikes in discussion.
  - News sentiment: high-signal company news and press coverage from the past week that could move sentiment and price.
  - Price/volatility context: overlay of TSLA price action and implied/realized volatility around sentiment shifts.
  - Key themes and drivers: recurring topics (e.g., product updates, production milestones, autopilot/AI, regulatory/news catalysts) and their potential market impact.
  - Trade implications: actionable takeaways for various trading horizons (intraday, swing, momentum), plus risk factors and counterpoints.
- Deliver a structured report with a clear narrative for traders, followed by a Makrdown table that organizes the key points.

What you’ll get in the final report (structure)
- Executive snapshot: TL;DR of sentiment signals, recent news, and potential implications for TSLA’s near-term path.
- Daily sentiment breakdown (past 7 days): sentiment scores by day, notable spikes, and possible catalysts.
- Top Reddit narratives: themes, meme vs. fundamental discussions, influencer posts, and sentiment drivers.
- News scan: a concise tally of notable headlines (product, earnings, deliveries, regulatory, partnerships) and their tone.
- Sentiment vs. price/action analysis: correlation of sentiment shifts with price moves and any lag patterns.
- Catalysts and risks: identified drivers for the next 1–2 weeks and potential downside/upside risks.
- Trader guidance: recommended approaches for different horizons, risk controls, and watchlist signals.
- Appendix: data notes, methodology, and data quality considerations.

Proposed next steps
- I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the backend issue is resolved (please let me know if you want me to keep retrying automatically for a set window, e.g., every 5 minutes for the next hour).
- If you’d prefer, I can also proceed with a parallel analysis using any other public sentiment sources you permit (e.g., Twitter/X, Stocktwits) if you provide access or allow me to fetch them via available tools.

If you’d like me to proceed with a best-effort interim draft using high-level, non-tool-specific insights (without Reddit data), I can draft that now. However, it would be speculative without the tool’s data feed, so the insights would be less precise.

Makrdown table (to be filled with data once the Reddit tool runs)
- I’m including this table as a placeholder to show the exact format I’ll deliver at the end of the full report.

| Section | What to look for | Data sources (to be used) | Potential trader implications |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Executive snapshot | Quick read on sentiment direction and key news tickers | Reddit TFs, company news | Quick risk-adjusted stance for the day |
| Daily sentiment (7d) | Day-by-day sentiment scores, spikes | Reddit posts, comments, upvotes | Identify entry/exit windows, momentum signals |
| Top Reddit narratives | Dominant themes, recurring topics, influencers | Reddit threads, subreddits like r/tesla, r/investing | Gauge conviction and possible mispricings |
| News sentiment | Tone and impact of last week’s headlines | Company press releases, news outlets | Catalysts to watch, timing for trades |
| Price action overlay | Price moves, volume, volatility around sentiment shifts | Price data, IV/VIX, volume | Confirm or refute sentiment with price behavior |
| Catalysts & risks | Upcoming events, regulatory updates, product announcements | News, earnings cadence, calendars | Positioning strategies around catalysts |
| Trader guidance | Recommended horizons and risk controls | Aggregated signals | Actionable trade ideas and risk limits |
| Data notes | Methodology, data quality, limitations | Internal notes | Transparency on confidence levels |

If you’d like me to keep retrying the Reddit data fetch automatically, say “Retry now for TSLA Reddit data,” and I’ll pursue a fresh pull and proceed with the full long-form report immediately once I have the data.

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
- Proceed now with the interim report outline based on known context (and clearly label any gaps due to data access issues)?
