I attempted to fetch NVDA price data for 2024-09-23 to 2025-09-23, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I don’t have an alternate data source loaded right now, so I can’t generate the actual indicator values at this moment. If you’d like, I can retry with a different date window or attempt to fetch from another source if you can provide one. In the meantime, here’s a robust, ready-to-use indicator set for NVDA and a detailed interpretation framework you can apply once the data is available.

Selected indicators (8 total, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these 8 are suitable for NVDA
- Trend confirmation and context: close_50_sma and close_200_sma give medium- and long-term trend context, helping you distinguish between sustained moves and pullbacks.
- Short-term momentum and entry timing: close_10_ema provides a quicker read on momentum shifts and potential entry points, especially useful in fast-moving AI and semiconductor cycles.
- Momentum strength and signals: macd, macds capture momentum crossovers and momentum shifts, which are valuable in a high-volatility stock like NVDA during AI demand cycles.
- Ongoing momentum and protection against false signals: rsi helps identify overbought/oversold tension and potential reversals, but should be filtered with trend analysis to avoid false cues in strong trends.
- Volatility and range: boll (Bollinger Middle) provides a dynamic benchmark around the 20-day baseline; combining with ATR (volatility) helps gauge breakout potential and stop-placement sensitivity.
- Volatility sizing and risk management: atr helps set position sizing and stop levels based on current market volatility, a critical factor for a stock with spikes in news-driven moves.

What to watch once data is available (nuanced framework)
- Trend regime: If NVDA price is above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, the regime is bullish; look for the 50 SMA crossing above the 200 SMA (golden cross) as a longer-term confirmation. If price is below these averages, treat as caution or bearish bias unless proven otherwise by a strong reversal signal.
- Short-term momentum: When the 10 EMA is above price, it can indicate waning short-term momentum (bearish sign). Conversely, 10 EMA crossing above price can signal short-term bullish momentum, especially if MACD is rising and above its signal.
- MACD signals: A MACD line crossing above the MACD signal line is a bullish cue; a cross below is bearish. Confirm within a higher-timeframe trend to reduce whipsaws.
- RSI context: RSI rising toward 70+ can indicate overbought conditions in an uptrend; RSI dipping toward 30+ in a downtrend suggests oversold pressure. Look for bullish/bearish divergences between RSI and price for potential reversals.
- Bollinger framework: Price hugging the Boll middle line suggests continuation; touching the upper band can indicate overextension in strong uptrends, while painting near the lower band indicates potential oversold conditions in downtrends. Confirm with MACD and RSI to avoid false signals.
- ATR-driven risk management: Higher ATR signals elevated volatility—consider widening stops or reducing position size; lower ATR suggests a quieter regime, allowing tighter risk controls.
- Volume considerations (if you add VWMA later): Confirm trends with volume-adjusted moves (price above VWMA with rising volume strengthens a trend; price below VWMA with rising volume can indicate distribution or exhaustion).

Guidance for decision-making (practical)
- In a confirmed uptrend (price above 50 and 200 SMA, MACD bullish, RSI not excessively overbought):
  - Look for pullbacks toward the 50 SMA or the 10 EMA as potential entries, provided MACD remains positive and RSI isn’t rolling over.
  - Use ATR to set a stop a multiple of ATR below recent swing lows; consider targeting prior swing highs or resistance around the upper Bollinger band.
- In range-bound or choppy markets (price oscillating around 50/200 SMA, MACD flat, RSI oscillating):
  - Favor shorter horizons; use the 10 EMA as a dynamic guide to intraday momentum; avoid large-timeframe entries without a clear MACD cross or RSI breakout.
- On breakouts (price closes above upper Bollinger band with rising ATR and increasing VWMA support):
  - Consider entries on a pullback toward the breakout level or the Bollinger middle line, with stops placed below the breakout gap or the ATR-derived volatility band.

Note on next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry fetching NVDA data now or with a different date window and then compute these indicators to provide a data-driven, numbers-backed interpretation. If you can authorize a data source change, I can proceed immediately.

Key points at a glance (table)
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  - What to watch: Price above/below, potential golden/death cross with 200 SMA
  - Signals: Price above and 50 SMA rising → bullish; price crossing below → caution/possible reversal
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark
  - What to watch: Crosses with 50 SMA (golden/death cross)
  - Signals: Above → bullish trend confirmation; below → long-term caution
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - Purpose: Short-term momentum shifts
  - What to watch: Price relative to 10 EMA; crossovers with price or other lines
  - Signals: 10 EMA crossing above price → potential near-term rally; crossing below → near-term weakness
- Indicator: macd
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals
  - What to watch: MACD line vs. signal line, histogram
