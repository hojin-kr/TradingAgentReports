Sorry about that—the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError on my end. It looks like a backend issue with the tool. I can retry fetching the SPY Reddit sentiment now, or if you’d prefer, I can proceed with a structured qualitative analysis and outline and fill in the data as soon as the tool comes back online.

Here are two options:

Option A — Retry now
- I’ll immediately retry get_reddit_stock_info for SPY on 2025-09-23 and then produce a comprehensive, data-backed report with:
  - Day-by-day sentiment trends over the past week
  - Key Reddit themes (e.g., market breadth, Fed expectations, sector rotations, pension/fund flows)
  - Implications for traders (short-term vs. longer-term)
  - A succinct set of risk signals
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing the key points

Option B — Proceed without live Reddit data (outline first)
- I’ll deliver a detailed report outline now (without tool data), and then plug in the Reddit sentiment and news specifics as soon as the tool is available again. This lets you review the structure and requirements ahead of time.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry now), say “Retry now” and I’ll run another fetch and deliver the full report. If you prefer Option B, I’ll provide the full report skeleton and a plan for data integration once the tool is back.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the outline first?
