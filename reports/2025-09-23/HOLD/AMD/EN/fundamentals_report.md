I ran into an internal tool error when trying to fetch AMD’s latest fundamental data. The attempts to call the SimFin and Finnhub endpoints returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the quarterly balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, insider sentiment, or insider transactions to report right now.

Options for moving forward:
- Option A: I retry the data retrieval immediately and, if successful, generate the full comprehensive report with all sections and the final Markdown table.
- Option B: I proceed with a qualitative framework now (without the numbers) and then fill in the data as soon as the tools respond successfully.
- Option C: You specify a preferred time window to retry (e.g., in 30 minutes, or at a specific time) and I’ll attempt again then.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with the plan to retry, I’ll attempt to fetch:
- SimFin quarterly balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow
- Finnhub insider sentiment (past 15 days)
- Finnhub insider transactions (past 15 days)

In the meantime, here is a structured outline of the comprehensive report I will deliver once data is available, along with a placeholder Markdown table to organize key points. You can review this and tell me to proceed with a retry.
