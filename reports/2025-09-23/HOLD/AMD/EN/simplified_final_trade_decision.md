# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD faces uncertain AI spending and Nvidia’s dominance. A durable margin lift and credible design wins could drive gains over time, but near-term risks justify a Hold.

## Investment Decision
Hold — Confidence: Medium

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term risks are credible: AI capex could slow, Nvidia remains a big headwind, and margins may stay pressured during ramp.
- Long-term upside is possible if execution proves durable: multiple design wins, recurring AI bookings, and better cost/margin dynamics could lift earnings power over time.
- The bull case depends on several uncertain milestones, not yet proven in the near term.
- A cautious stance preserves optionality: Hold today with a watchful eye for clear, verifiable progress before increasing exposure.

## Risks To Watch
- AI capex cycle slows or stays choppy; margins don’t improve as ramps unfold.
- Nvidia-led pricing/monster ecosystem continues to challenge AMD’s margin expansion.
- ROCm adoption and multi-architecture strategy fail to gain scale; design wins slow.
- Competitive pressures from Intel and other players limit earnings upside.
- Macro weakness or supply constraints could dampen data-center demand and bookings.
