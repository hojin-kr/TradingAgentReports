I attempted to fetch AMD data and run the 8 indicators you asked for, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. Because I don’t have the actual price/indicator values right now, I can’t produce a data-driven trend report. I can still provide a clear plan: (a) confirm the exact 8 indicators to use (they’re below), (b) explain how to interpret them once data is available, and (c) outline a detailed decision framework you can apply as soon as the data is retrievable. If you want, I can retry fetching data now or after you confirm, or you can provide the data you have.

Selected indicators for AMD (8 total, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these 8 are suitable for AMD in a typical mid-to-long-term trading context
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful to gauge whether AMD is in a recoverable uptrend or a risk-off environment.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm regime (bullish/bearish). Useful for avoiding counter-trend entries and for quality of trend alignment with broader market conditions.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum signal; can signal quick shifts in price pressure. Best used in conjunction with the longer SMAs to filter noise.
- macd: Core momentum indicator; MACD line versus signal line crossovers help identify potential trend changes. Helpful in confirming momentum direction when price is near key levels.
- macds: MACD Signal; the smoothed MACD component to corroborate MACD cross signals and to gauge the strength of momentum via histogram dynamics.
- rsi: Momentum strength and divergence tool; overbought/oversold cues (commonly 70/30) and potential reversals. In strong uptrends RSI can ride high for extended periods, so combine with trend direction.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a baseline for price movement; combined with band behavior, helps identify squeeze, breakouts, or mean-reversion tendencies around the baseline.
- atr: Volatility measure; informs stop-loss placement and position sizing. Reactive but essential for risk management in a stock with potentially sharp moves around earnings or product-cycle events.

How to interpret these indicators once data is available (detailed, scenario-based)
- Trend confirmation (50SMA vs 200SMA)
  - If price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA, and 50SMA is above 200SMA: bullish alignment. Look for further momentum confirmation from MACD, RSI in positive territory, and price holding above the 10 EMA as a near-term trigger.
  - If price is below both SMAs, and 50SMA is below 200SMA: bearish alignment. Seek momentum follow-through from MACD/RSI in bearish territory and watch for potential support near the 50/200 SMA zone.
  - Cross of 50SMA above 200SMA (golden cross) or below (death cross) can provide bigger-picture confirmation or caution. Use with MACD and RSI to avoid late entries.
- Momentum signals (MACD family)
  - MACD crossing above the MACD Signal, with a rising MACD histogram, supports drift into a bullish move, especially if price is above the 50/200 SMAs.
  - MACD crossing below with a falling histogram supports a bearish move; confirm with RSI not diverging positively against price.
  - If MACD signals conflict with price action (e.g., price making new highs but MACD not confirming), rely on RSI and Bollinger bands to filter false positives.
- Short-term momentum and entry timing (10 EMA)
  - A price crossing above the 10 EMA, especially when above the 50SMA, can indicate a kick-off in near-term upside momentum; be mindful of noise in choppy markets; require MACD/RSi confirmation.
  - A price crossing below the 10 EMA in a bullish regime may indicate a pullback; use ATR to ensure the move isn’t just a volatility spike.
- Momentum strength and reversals (RSI)
  - RSI approaching overbought (near 70) in a strong uptrend should be treated cautiously; wait for a MACD/price pullback for a potential entry.
  - RSI near or below 30 with price holding above key support and MACD turning up could signal a potential bottom.
  - Watch for RSI divergences (price making new highs while RSI fails to) as a potential warning of a slowdown in the uptrend.
- Volatility and risk management (ATR)
  - Rising ATR implies increasing volatility; adjust position size and stop distances accordingly.
  - If ATR compresses, a breakout could signal a new move; consider tighter risk controls until volatility expands.
- Volatility-baseline context (Boll)
  - Price interacting with the Bollinger Middle (boll) can indicate mean reversion or continuation depending on pacing. Breakouts beyond the upper/lower bands (boll_ub/boll_lb) typically require confirmation with MACD/RSI for reliability. Since we’re using boll only here, use it as a baseline with price action and other indicators for breakout/reversal confirmation.

Risk and interpretation caveats
- Data quality and timing: All conclusions hinge on up-to-date price data. Once data is retrievable, run the indicators and re-assess.
- AMD-specific event risk: Earnings, product周期 (GPU/CPU launches), supply chain news, and AI market dynamics can cause abrupt moves that may not be fully captured by standard indicators.
- Do not rely on a single indicator: The combination above is chosen to balance trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management. Signals should align across multiple indicators before taking positions.
- Market regime matters: In sideways markets, MACD crossovers and RSI signals can generate false entries. Weight trend indicators (50/200 SMA) more heavily in such environments.

Proposed next steps
- Retry data retrieval for AMD with the same date range, or provide a CSV with price data so I can compute the indicators and produce a precise trend report.
- If you prefer, I can switch to a shorter look-back window (e.g., last 60–90 days) to capture more recent dynamics, or add a volatility-based stop strategy using ATR.
