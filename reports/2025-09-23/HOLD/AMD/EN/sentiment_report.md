Thanks for the update. I ran into an internal issue pulling Reddit data:

- Error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) from get_reddit_stock_info

I can’t complete the Reddit sentiment pull right now due to this tool failure. Here are a few options so we can keep moving:

Option A: Retry later
- I can attempt the Reddit data pull again shortly or as soon as the tool is back online and provide the full, sentiment-driven AMD analysis with day-by-day sentiment and top topics.

Option B: Use alternative sources for the analysis
- I can proceed with a comprehensive AMD analysis focusing on: recent company news, earnings guidance, product cycle context, and sentiment signals from other public sources (e.g., press releases, official statements, major tech outlets, social media outside Reddit). I can still deliver a long-form report with insights, implications for traders, and a detailed end-table.

Option C: Prepare a framework and placeholders
- I can produce a thorough analysis framework now, outlining exactly what I’ll measure, how I’ll interpret it, and the kinds of signals to watch, plus a filled-in Markdown table template. Once Reddit data returns, I’ll plug in the exact figures and finish the report.

If you’d like the quickest path forward, I recommend Option B or C so you still get valuable, actionable insights while we resolve the tool issue.

What I’ll deliver in a full AMD report (regardless of data source):
- Executive snapshot: core sentiment takeaway, key drivers, and probable near-term catalysts.
- Daily sentiment and volume (if available): how mood shifts day by day, what topics dominate, and whether sentiment aligns with any known events.
- Top topics and notable posts: major themes (e.g., GPU demand, supply chain, AI accelerators, gaming console Windows/PC cycles, datacenter demand) and any high-engagement posts.
- Company news & catalysts: earnings, product launches, partnerships, guidance changes, regulatory or macro factors impacting AMD.
- Risks and opportunities: short- and mid-term implications for traders, with scenarios (bullish, bearish, neutral).
- Implications for trading decisions: what signals would push you toward Buy/Hold/Sell in the coming weeks, with a concise rationale.
- Data-driven guidance: what metrics to track (sentiment breadth, engagement quality, topic drift, event-driven spikes, etc.)
- Markdown table: a clear, at-a-glance summary with key points organized for quick reference.

If you want me to proceed now with Option B (alternative sources) or Option C (framework + placeholders), tell me which you prefer. I’ll tailor the report to AMD and the current date window (past 7 days to the present). Once Reddit data is available again, I’ll incorporate it and finalize the full analysis.

Additionally, if you want a preview, I can draft a compact, ready-to-fill template for the final Markdown table right away.
