Recommendation: Hold AMD with a disciplined, risk-managed posture.

Rationale
- Near-term risks (AI capex uncertainty, Nvidia’s dominance, macro headwinds, potential margin pressure) argue against an outright Buy in the current setup.
- Longer-term bull case remains plausible if design wins convert into durable margins and recurring AI bookings. The plan you provided already captures this balance: Hold now to preserve optionality while awaiting clearer evidence of earnings leverage.

Actionable implementation
- Position sizing and risk controls
  - Maintain a modest core position aligned to your risk tolerance.
  - Establish a defined downside framework (e.g., limit per-position drawdown to a fixed percentage or dollar amount).
  - Implement a clear stop framework around catalysts (earnings, guidance updates) and consider a trailing stop to lock in on upside moves.
  - Consider hedging (protective puts or a collar) around key events to cap downside while preserving some upside.

- Data and trigger monitoring (credibles signals)
  - Data-center AI bookings pace and revenue mix shifts (accelerator vs legacy).
  - Gross margin trajectory as volumes ramp; evidence of durable margin inflection.
  - Design-win momentum with hyperscalers/OEMs and ROCm adoption progress.
  - Competitive dynamics: Nvidia’s updates, Intel AI initiatives, and pricing/bundling shifts.

- Conditional path to upgrade (to Buy)
  - Sustained, verifiable margin improvement and durable AI-driven bookings.
  - Multiple confirmed design wins translating into repeatable revenue growth and improved mix.
  - Free-cash-flow durability or accretive capital allocation signaling longer-term upside.

- Conditional path to lower stance (to Sell)
  - AI demand deterioration, persistent margin weakness during ramp, or failure to convert design wins into earnings power.
  - Deterioration in cash flow or cash-usage signals without offsetting catalysts.

Monitoring checklist (tight)
- Data-center AI bookings pace and gross margin trajectory.
- ROCm adoption and enterprise traction.
- Competitive signals from Nvidia/Intel regarding pricing, bundling, and market share.
- Earnings guidance, capital allocation signals, and cash-flow health.

Lessons applied
- Don’t overweight a single megatheme without tangible, durable earnings leverage.
- Require concrete execution milestones (design wins, margin inflection) before shifting stance.
- Use predefined risk controls (stops, hedges, position sizing) to guard against hype-driven moves.
- Rely on credible, verifiable signals rather than sentiment or headlines.
- Stay flexible: ready to upgrade to Buy on clear, durable evidence or downgrade to Sell if the thesis deteriorates.

If you want, I can tailor this into a concrete script with specific price targets, stop levels, and hedging ideas aligned to your portfolio size and risk tolerance.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
