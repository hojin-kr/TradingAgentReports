Recommendation: Hold META now.

Rationale
- The provided investment plan favors Hold: the bull case is plausible over the long run, but near-term signals are murky due to regulatory costs, ad-market cyclicality, and uncertain pacing and profitability of AI monetization and metaverse initiatives.
- Data gaps and macro headwinds raise the risk premium for a near-term Buy, even as AI and enterprise AI potential remain meaningful optional upside.
- A disciplined Hold preserves optionality while awaiting clearer catalysts and verifiable progress (ads ROAS, margin leverage, regulatory clarity, and credible AR/VR monetization signals).

What could shift to Buy
- Material, verifiable acceleration in AI monetization with measurable ROAS uplift and margin expansion.
- Clear regulatory clarity reducing ongoing costs and governance drag.
- A credible, cash-flow-positive metaverse/hardware monetization plan with defined timelines and positive cash flow impact.

What could trigger a downgrade
- Escalating regulatory costs without offsetting margins.
- Stagnation or deterioration in ad demand beyond AIâ€™s offsetting effects.
- AR/VR ROI remaining negative for an extended period without a clear roadmap to profitability.

Practical steps if staying in Hold
- Maintain a balanced core exposure with a controlled sleeve for optionality.
- Use predefined risk controls (stops around trend lines/major moving averages, hedges if overweight).
- Monitor catalysts: ROAS milestones, enterprise/Llama traction, regulatory cost developments, margin trajectory, and any monetization signals from AR/VR.

If you want, I can pull fresh data now to deliver a fully data-backed synthesis (indicators, trend signals, and a refreshed target range) and then reassess the stance with concrete catalysts. For now, the stance remains Hold.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
