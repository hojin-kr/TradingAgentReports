Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch the quarterly SimFin and Finnhub data (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, insider sentiment, insider transactions) for PLTR, but all tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError. That looks like an environment/data access issue rather than an issue with PLTR data itself. I can proceed in a few ways:

- Retry data retrieval now (or after a short delay) to pull the required financial statements and insider data.
- If you prefer, switch to a qualitative, fundamentals-focused overview using public information up to date, clearly marking any numbers as approximate or pending verification.
- Use alternative data sources you specify (e.g., other financial data providers) and then synthesize into a single report.

If you’d like, I can retry immediately. In the meantime, I’ll outline a comprehensive PLTR fundamentals report structure and provide a ready-to-use Markdown table to capture key points once data is retrieved. This will help traders gain a detailed view even if data retrieval is temporarily interrupted.

What I will include (structure you can expect once data is in):
- Company profile and business model
  - Overview of Palantir (PLTR): core products (Foundry, Gotham), customers (government vs commercial), revenue composition, and market positioning.
  - Long-term growth drivers and potential headwinds.
- Financial statements (most recent quarter and trailing year)
  - Income statement: revenue growth, gross margin, R&D/sales/SG&A as % of revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (EPS).
  - Balance sheet: cash and equivalents, debt, working capital, minority interests, intangibles, book value.
  - Cash flow: FCF, OCF, capex, financing activities, free cash flow realization.
- Financial history and trend analysis
  - Revenue trajectory, margin evolution, profitability timeline, leverage, and liquidity trends.
  - Seasonality, contract backlog/visibility, and non-recurring items.
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions
  - Short-term insider sentiment (last 15 days), notable insider buys/sells, potential interpretation for alignment with share price.
- Key risk factors and catalysts
  - Customer concentration, government contract exposure, competitive dynamics, regulatory angles, stock-based compensation impact, and optionality in Foundry adoption.
- Fine-grained trader-oriented insights
  - What would signal a constructive or concerning turn (e.g., sustained FCF positive, accelerating billings, improving gross margins, large insider selling vs. buying, decked-out backlog, use of non-GAAP adjustments).
- Quick-reference table (Markdown) to summarize key data points

Proposed Markdown table to append at the end (fill with actual figures once data is retrieved)

If you want me to proceed right away, tell me to retry the data fetch now. I can also proceed with a qualitative PLTR fundamentals overview (without exact quarterly numbers) and clearly annotate where data would be required to confirm. Let me know your preference:

- Option A: Retry data pulls now and then deliver the full, data-backed report with the Markdown table.
- Option B: Deliver a qualitative, numbers-free fundamentals report with methodology and risk factors, plus a framework you can populate once data is retrieved.
- Option C: Provide a high-level summary based on publicly available context up to date (with explicit caveats about not having the latest quarterly figures).

Would you like me to retry the data fetch immediately (Option A), or proceed with one of the alternatives?
