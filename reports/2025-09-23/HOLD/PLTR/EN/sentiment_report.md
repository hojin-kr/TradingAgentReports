Sorry about thatâ€”the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can try again now, or if you prefer, I can proceed using other sources (e.g., latest PLTR news, official filings, and general sentiment from other social outlets) and prepare the long-form report with those data.

What would you like to do?
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now
- Proceed with an analysis based on alternative sources (no Reddit data)
- Wait for you to provide access or a workaround and then proceed

If you want a quick path forward, I can start with a comprehensive PLTR analysis using available public news and sentiment signals (explicitly noting that Reddit data is pending) and plan to supplement with Reddit once the tool is functioning.
