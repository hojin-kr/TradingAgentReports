I ran into an issue retrieving TSLA data from the data source (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I’m unable to compute the actual indicator values right now, so I can’t generate a live trend report or signal readings. If you’d like, I can retry once the data path is available, or proceed with a detailed, qualitative TSLA analysis based on typical market behavior and the chosen indicator framework. Below is a proposed, well-rounded indicator set (8 indicators) and how they would work together once data is accessible, along with a detailed plan for interpreting TSLA in this framework.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) and rationale for TSLA
- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum, responsive to quick shifts in price.
  - How to use for TSLA: Look for price crossing above/below the 10 EMA for early entry/exit signals; useful to catch momentum changes around earnings or headlines.
  - Caveats: Susceptible to noise in choppy markets; filter with longer averages.

- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: Intermediate trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use for TSLA: Price above the 50 SMA suggests a bullish intermediate trend; a drop below may indicate a pullback or trend pause.
  - Caveats: Lags price; best used with faster signals for timely entries.

- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark.
  - How to use for TSLA: Price above the 200 SMA supports a long-term uptrend bias; weave in crossovers (golden/death cross) for strategic positioning.
  - Caveats: Very lagging; confirm with momentum and volatility signals before committing to large positions.

- macd
  - What it measures: Momentum via the difference of EMAs and the MACD line.
  - How to use for TSLA: Look for MACD line crossovers with the signal line for potential trend changes; magnitude of the histogram (macdh) can indicate momentum strength.
  - Caveats: Crossovers can produce false signals in low-volatility environments; require confirmation from other indicators.

- macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (smoothing of MACD).
  - How to use for TSLA: Use MACD vs MACS crossovers to trigger or confirm trades; good complement to macd cross signals.
  - Caveats: As with macd, rely on multi-indicator confirmation to reduce whipsaws.

- rsi
  - What it measures: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold levels.
  - How to use for TSLA: RSI extremes (e.g., overbought near 70+, oversold near 30-) can warn of mean-reversion opportunities; watch for divergence with price as a confirmation signal.
  - Caveats: In strong trends RSI can remain overbought/oversold for extended periods; combine with trend indicators.

- boll
  - What it measures: Bollinger middle (20-SMA) used as a dynamic benchmark; helps contextualize volatility with price deviation.
  - How to use for TSLA: Price interacting with the middle band can indicate mean-reversion pressure; coupling with upper/lower bands helps spot breakouts and reversals.
  - Caveats: Bands may expand in volatile periods; confirm with other momentum/volume signals.

- atr
  - What it measures: Market volatility (true range average).
  - How to use for TSLA: Use ATR to size positions and place stops adaptively; higher ATR suggests wider stop placement and greater tolerance for price moves.
  - Caveats: Reactive rather than predictive; use for risk management rather than directional signals alone.

Optional but helpful notes
- If you want an additional volume-confirmation dimension, we could substitute or pair in vwma (volume-weighted moving average) to strengthen trend confirmation with price and volume, but I’ve kept to 8 indicators as a balanced, non-redundant set.

What to watch for TSLA in this framework (structured expectations)
- Trend context: Use the 50 SMA and 200 SMA to establish whether TSLA is in a bullish, bearish, or range-bound regime. In a bullish regime, prioritize long-side MACD momentum signals and pullbacks that hold above the 50 SMA and test the 10 EMA as potential entry points.
- Momentum cues: MACD and RSI together help gauge if a move is gaining steam or faltering. A bullish MACD crossover with RSI not yet in overbought territory provides a more sustainable entry signal; a conflict (MACD bullish but RSI overbought) warrants caution.
- Volatility and risk: ATR informs position sizing and stop placement; Boll middle helps gauge if price is reverting to a mean or continuing a breakout when combined with bands.
- Execution cadence: In high-variance periods (earnings, product announcements, macro news), allow for wider stop losses guided by ATR and verify signals with MACD and RSI to reduce whipsaws.

Next steps
- I can retry pulling the data and compute the 8-indicator framework as soon as the data source is accessible. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry data retrieval now and then produce a full, data-backed trend report with a detailed interpretation and a trading plan.
  - Or proceed with a qualitative TSLA analysis based on this framework without live numeric values, then update with exact readings once data is available.

Appendix: Key points in a compact table
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for TSLA | How to act (trading signals) | Caveats |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|---------|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above/below 10 EMA signals quick shifts | Look for cross above price for entries; use with longer trend filters | Noise in choppy markets; confirm with others |
| close_50_sma | Intermediate trend | Price above/below 50 SMA indicates uptrend/downtrend | Favor long ideas when price above; use pullbacks to 50 SMA as potential entries | Lags price; combine with momentum |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Price above 200 SMA suggests bullish macro trend | Use for strategic bias; consider golden/death cross signals | Very lagging; need confirmation |
| macd | Momentum momentum/gap between EMAs | Crosses with signal line indicate trend changes | Use crossovers as signals; confirm with RSI and price action | Susceptible to false signals in quiet markets |
| macds | MACD signal line | Momentum strength indicated by MACD vs signal | Confirm MACD cross with price action and RSI | Similar to MACD; redundancy can exist |
| rsi | Momentum/extremes | Overbought/oversold cues; potential reversals | Use around 30/70 with divergence as reversal clues | Can stay extended in strong trends |
| boll | Bollinger middle (20-SMA) context | Price interactions with middle band indicate mean-reversion or breakout context | Use with bands to spot breakouts or reversals | Bands widen in high volatility environments |
| atr | Volatility level | Higher ATR means bigger price moves; informs risk and stops | Size positions and set stops using ATR multiples | Reactive, not predictive |

If you’d like me to proceed now, I can attempt another data fetch and then produce a fully data-driven 8-indicator report for TSLA. Please tell me whether you want me to retry the data pull immediately or switch to the qualitative framework and fill in live readings later.
