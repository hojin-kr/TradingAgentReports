I’m running into a tool error right now.

What happened
- I attempted to fetch TSLA Reddit stock sentiment for multiple dates (2025-09-17 to 2025-09-23) in parallel, and then with a single call, but the get_reddit_stock_info tool returned FileNotFoundError for all attempts. This looks like a backend/filesystem issue rather than an input error.

What this means for now
- I can’t pull the Reddit sentiment data needed to produce the full long-form, day-by-day sentiment analysis and its implications right this moment.
- I can still outline the report structure and populate it as soon as the Reddit tool is available again.

Options to proceed
1) Wait and auto-retry: I’ll reattempt the Reddit data fetch periodically and continue the analysis as soon as the tool comes back online.
2) Use an alternate data source (if you’re able to authorize): I could incorporate sentiment/news from other sources (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, major news outlets) once you approve switching sources. Note: I don’t have a separate tool in this session to pull those automatically, but I can still synthesize qualitative sentiment if you provide links or summaries.
3) Prepare a robust framework now: I can deliver a detailed report framework with a placeholder data section. Once the Reddit tool returns, I’ll fill in the exact daily sentiment numbers, themes, and tie-ins to TSLA price/news. This lets you review the structure and criteria first.

If you’d like me to proceed with option 3 now, I’ll deliver:
- A comprehensive analysis framework (methodology, data sources, sentiment scoring approach)
- A day-by-day template for 2025-09-17 through 2025-09-23 (sections to fill in with actual sentiment data)
- A list of potential catalysts and risk factors to watch for
- Trader-oriented insights (how sentiment might impact risk/reward, potential entry/exit considerations)
- A Makrdown table at the end organizing key points, metrics, and implications

Please tell me which path you prefer:
- Retry automatically for Reddit data when the tool is back
- Move to an alternative data source (and confirm you’re okay with that)
- Go ahead with the full framework now and fill in data later

Note: There is no FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL (BUY/HOLD/SELL) yet.
