Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the data for GOOGL, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the data source isn’t accessible at the moment, so I can’t run the full indicator analysis on actual recent data yet. I can either retry right away or proceed with a plan and indicator framework you can run once the data pull succeeds. Let me lay out both:

What happened
- Data fetch issue: get_YFin_data returned a FileNotFoundError. This prevents generating the CSV needed for precise, data-driven indicator readings and a detailed trend report.

What I can do now (two options)
Option A — Ready-to-run indicator framework (no data yet)
- I’ll prepare the – up to 8 – indicators that provide complementary insights for GOOGL in a typical AI/tech-ad landscape (trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management). Once you or I retry and the data is successfully retrieved, I’ll generate a detailed, data-backed trend report using these indicators.

Option B — Immediate qualitative guidance (no data pull)
- I’ll provide a detailed, nuanced framework for how to interpret GOOGL once data is available, including interpretation guidance for the selected indicators, plausible scenario outcomes, and decision rules. This can be used right away and then swapped into a data-driven report once the fetch succeeds.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
Rationale: For a large-cap AI/tech leader like Alphabet (GOOGL), you want to capture medium- to long-term trend context, momentum shifts, and volatility/risk controls. The following mix covers trend confirmation, momentum signals, and volatility awareness without overlapping too much.

Selected indicators:
- close_50_sma — Moving Averages (trend direction, dynamic support/resistance)
- close_200_sma — Moving Averages (longer-term trend confirmation, golden/death-cross context)
- close_10_ema — Moving Averages (short-term momentum shifts, potential entries)
- macd — MACD (momentum/trend-change signals via EMA differences)
- macds — MACD Signal (smoothed MACD crossover signal)
- macdh — MACD Histogram (momentum strength and divergence cues)
- rsi — RSI (momentum with overbought/oversold signals and possible divergences)
- atr — ATR (volatility-based risk management and position sizing)

Note: This set emphasizes trend framing (50/200 SMAs and 10 EMA for near-term momentum), momentum confirmation (MACD family and RSI), and volatility/risk management (ATR). If you’d rather include volume confirmation, I could swap in vwma for a volume-weighted trend check, but for a clean, non-redundant eight-indicator setup, the above is well balanced.

What to expect in the full analysis (once data is available)
- Trend frame:
  - 50_sma and 200_sma will indicate the prevailing trend direction and potential support/resistance zones. Crosses like 50 crossing above/below 200 (Golden/Death Cross) will be flagged as longer-term trend inflection cues.
  - 10 ema will capture quicker momentum shifts that can pre-empt longer-term trend moves but may produce false signals in choppy markets; it will be filtered through MACD and RSI.
- Momentum signals:
  - MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram together will show momentum strength, potential crossovers, and divergences. A bullish setup would look for MACD above the signal with a positive histogram expanding; a bearish setup would be the opposite.
  - RSI will provide overbought/oversold context and potential reversals or divergences, especially when price action diverges from RSI trends.
- Volatility/risk checks:
  - ATR will help determine risk controls (e.g., stop placement and position sizing) relative to current price volatility.
- Interpretation guardrails:
  - In high-volatility phases, rely more on MACD/MACD histogram confirmation and RSI only after trend direction is established by the moving averages.
  - In range-bound markets, expect MACD/histogram to swing with the price; use RSI divergences with caution and rely on ATR for risk caps.

Next steps
1) Please confirm if you want me to retry fetching the data now (GOOGL, 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-23) and then generate the full 8-indicator report with detailed trend insights.
2) If you’d prefer, I can proceed with Option B (qualitative framework) right away and then produce the full data-driven report once the data pull succeeds.

Appendix: Indicator summary table (for quick reference)
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  - What to look for: Price above/below 50 SMA; 50 SMA bending with price; potential cross with price as a signal context

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Long-term trend confirmation
  - What to look for: Price above/below 200 SMA; golden/death cross signals with other indicators

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Short-term momentum shifts
  - What to look for: Quick price movements relative to 10 EMA; possible entry/exit foreshadowing

- Indicator: macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals
  - What to look for: MACD line crossing above/below the signal; crossovers with histogram corroboration

- Indicator: macds
  - Category: MACD Related

- Indicator: macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: Momentum strength visualization
  - What to look for: Increasing histogram magnitude confirms momentum; divergences warn of potential reversal

- Indicator: rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Purpose: Overbought/oversold context and potential reversals
  - What to look for: RSI extreme levels (e.g., >70 or <30) and divergences, in conjunction with trend context

  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Purpose: Volatility-based risk management (stop placement, sizing)
  - What to look for: rising ATR signals higher risk; use to tune stops/position size

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed (retry now, or roll with the qualitative framework until data is up). I’ll align immediately and produce the full, data-driven trend report as soon as I can fetch the CSV successfully.
