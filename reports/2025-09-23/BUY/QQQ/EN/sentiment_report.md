Thanks for the prompt. I tried to pull the latest Reddit/stock-news data for QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF) on 2025-09-23, but the data retrieval tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I can’t fetch the Reddit feed in this moment due to that tool hiccup. Here’s how I suggest we proceed and what I can deliver right away, given the constraint.

What I can do right now (without fresh data)
- Provide a rigorous framework for analyzing QQQ sentiment and news over the past week, with clear signals that traders typically monitor.
- Outline the key drivers for a tech-heavy ETF like QQQ, including how social sentiment on mega-cap holdings (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google/Alphabet, Amazon, etc.) tends to move the ETF.
- Supply a structured report plan and a Markdown table template to organize findings once data is available.
- If you’d like, I can retry fetching Reddit/backed sources immediately or on a schedule, and then fill in the specifics.

High-level framework for a comprehensive QQQ sentiment/news analysis (to be populated with data)
- Objective
  - Assess sentiment and news flow around QQQ over the past 7 days and translate into potential trading implications for the ETF and its top-weighted holdings.
- Data sources and signals (with Reddit as a core source when available)
  - Reddit: r/investing, r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets, and related subreddits discussing QQQ and tech mega-caps.
  - News headlines: major tech earnings, AI developments, macro data, Fed commentary, geopolitical news affecting tech demand, supply chain updates.
  - Market microstructure: intraday sentiment swings, options activity skew on QQQ and its top holdings, fund flows (if available).
  - Note: In practice, QQQ’s sentiment is driven by its holdings’ performance and AI/tech narrative more than the ETF itself.
- Key sentiment readouts to produce
  - Overall daily sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative) across the past week.
  - Top themes driving sentiment (AI hype, earnings previews/results, rate expectations, geopolitical risk, supply chain chatter, valuation concerns).
  - Holding-level spillovers: how sentiment on Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and similar megacaps correlates with QQQ sentiment.
  - News catalysts: any recurring events (e.g., AI breakthrough reports, chip pricing, antitrust/regulatory news) that may shift sentiment.
- Potential trading implications
  - Positive sentiment surge tied to AI/tech upside could support QQQ relative outperformance, especially if Nvidia and other mega-caps lead the rally.
  - Deteriorating sentiment around growth/inflation or rate-hike expectations could pressure QQQ on a relative basis, given its growth-tech tilt.
  - The ETF’s risk-on/off sensitivity may spike when the Nasdaq-100 index shows dispersion among top holdings; be mindful of sector rotation.
- Data quality caveats
  - Reddit sentiment is noisy and can overstate hype around single events. Validate with news headlines and broader market context.
  - ETF-level sentiment can diverge from single-stock sentiment if a few names drive most of the index’s performance.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed narrative of sentiment by day for the last 7 days, with:
  - Positive/neutral/negative breakdown.
  - Top themes and quotes (summarized) from posts.
  - Notable posts or threads that imply a directional bias.
- A synthesis of recent news headlines affecting QQQ and its major constituents.
- An implications section with concrete trading takeaways:
  - Short-term (next 1-5 days): expected move drivers and potential setups.
  - Medium-term (next 2-4 weeks): where risk/reward lies given macro/tech narratives.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing: sources, sentiment score, main themes, key catalysts, and suggested actions.

Proposed next steps
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch for 2025-09-23 now (or at a scheduled cadence) and then I’ll populate the full report with concrete sentiment numbers and news items.
- Option B: If you prefer, I can proceed with a data-less but method-heavy report now (framework + best-practice signals + hypothetical scenarios) and you or I can plug in the actual sentiment numbers later.

Please let me know which option you want:
- Retry data fetch now, or
- Proceed with the data-less framework (and I’ll fill in the numbers once the tool is back up)

In the meantime, here is a ready-to-fill Markdown table format you can expect in the final report. You can copy/paste this as a template and I’ll populate it with actual figures once the data comes through.

Markdown table template (to be filled after data retrieval)
- Source | Date | Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) | Main Themes | Key Catalysts | Holdings Impact (mega-cap drivers) | Suggested Action

If you’d like me to proceed with a best-effort qualitative brief right now (without the day-by-day numeric sentiment), I can deliver that as well.
