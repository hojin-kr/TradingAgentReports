I tried to fetch NFLX price data with get_YFin_data, but I’m running into a data-access error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I attempted the call twice more, and the issue persists. I can proceed with a solid indicator plan now and describe how I would interpret NFLX signals once data is available, or I can keep retrying to fetch the data in the background and update you when it succeeds. Let me know which you prefer. In the meantime, here is a concise, aligned indicator setup and a detailed interpretive framework you can use once the data is retrieved.

Selected indicators (8 total) for NFLX
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll

Why these indicators are complementary for NFLX
- close_50_sma: Provides a medium-term trend view to help confirm overall direction (bullish/bearish) and acts as a dynamic support/resistance level. Useful for filtering trades in the noisy post-earnings moves often seen with growth names.
- close_200_sma: Establishes a long-term trend benchmark; helps identify structural regime (above = bullish, below = bearish). Also relevant for potential crossovers with the 50SMA as a longer-term trend confirmation (golden/death cross considerations).
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum proxy that can flag early shifts in price action, potentially signaling entries or brief pullbacks within the broader trend.
- macd, macds, macdh: A complete MACD setup that gives momentum (MACD line), trend strength via the signal line crossovers (MACDS), and momentum magnitude via the histogram (MACDH). Together they help identify changes in momentum, confirm breakouts, and warn of false signals when used with price and other indicators.
- rsi: A momentum oscillator useful for spotting overbought/oversold conditions and potential mean-reversion occasions. For NFLX, RSI trends can diverge from price in strong uptrends, so it’s important to cross-check with trend indicators (SMA/EMA) and MACD.
- boll: Bollinger middle (20SMA) provides a baseline around which price volatility is measured. Price interacting with the middle line (and the implied bands, if you later track boll_ub/boll_lb) helps gauge squeezes, breakouts, or resistance around a dynamic mean. It complements the plain price SMAs by framing volatility context.

How I’d analyze NFLX once data is available (detailed, actionable framework)
1) Trend confirmation framework
- Compare price to 50SMA and 200SMA:
  - If price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA, look for bullish setups; if below, consider bearish bias.
  - Watch for a potential golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) or death cross (50SMA crossing below 200SMA) as longer-cycle confirmations.
- Interpret close_10_ema in relation to price:
  - Price trading above 10 EMA supports near-term bullish momentum; price reversion below 10 EMA can signal early weakness or a pullback within the uptrend.

2) Momentum confirmation (MACD cluster)
- MACD crossing above its signal line (MACD > MACDS) generally supports upside bias; a cross below supports downside bias.
- MACD histogram (MACDH) strengthening (rising positive bars) adds conviction to the move; weakening (rising negative bars) warns of fading momentum.
- Look for MACD crossovers to align with price-position relative to SMAs for higher-probability entries.

3) Momentum-rotations with RSI
- RSI > 70 suggests overbought conditions within an uptrend; RSI < 30 suggests oversold conditions within a downtrend. In strong trends, RSI can stay extended longer, so filter signals with MACD and price position relative to SMAs.
- Watch for RSI divergences (price making higher highs while RSI fails to, or price making lower highs while RSI makes higher highs) as potential reversal signals when combined with MACD trend changes.

4) Volatility and mean reversion context (Bollinger baseline)
- Boll middle (20SMA) provides a dynamic mean to assess how price is moving around a central tendency. If price drifts away from the middle and bands start to tighten, that can precede a volatility squeeze and potential breakout.
- Use the context of the middle line with MACD and RSI: a strong up move away from the Boll middle with positive MACD and rising RSI supports continuation; a move back toward the middle with weakening MACD may indicate a pullback and potential re-entry zone.

5) Composite signal logic (practical approach)
- Bullish scenario: price above 50SMA and 200SMA; 10 EMA above price pullback; MACD line above signal with rising histogram; RSI in neutral to slightly elevated range (40–70) without overextension; price maintains above Boll middle.
- Bearish scenario: price below 50SMA and 200SMA; 10 EMA crossing below price; MACD below signal with negative histogram; RSI trending toward or below 30; price failing to hold above Boll middle or breaking below lower band context (if you later add Boll upper/lower bands).
- Neutral/transition: mixed SMA signals with price oscillating around 50SMA and 10 EMA; MACD near zero or crossing; RSI in the 40–60 range; Boll middle serving as a dynamic pivot.

6) Risk management and context
- For position sizing, consider ATR as a companion metric if/when you gain access to it; use ATR to adapt stop levels to current volatility. Since ATR is not in the current 8-indicator set, keep it in mind as a future enhancement.
- Use VWMA (volume-weighted) in conjunction with price and MACD/RSI to confirm if price moves are supported by volume (helps avoid traps on thin-volume rallies).

Notes, caveats, and expectations
- Data dependency: All of the above analysis hinges on current NFLX price data. The data fetch hiccup means I can't quote live levels or generate an exact recent-crossing interpretation yet.
- NFLX can experience regime shifts driven by earnings, subscriber guidance, macro risk, and tech-sector momentum. Indicator signals should be interpreted with awareness of upcoming catalysts and industry news.
- No single indicator is conclusive; the proposed 8-indicator mix is designed to provide trend, momentum, and volatility context with complementary viewpoints and minimal redundancy.

If you’d like, I can keep retrying the data retrieval in the background and re-run the indicator analysis as soon as the CSV data becomes available. Alternatively, I can proceed with a live-data-free hypothetical scenario and illustrate how to trade NFLX using the 8 indicators using example numbers (synthetic data) to show signal generation logic.

Proposed quick reference (8-indicator setup)
- Indicators: close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macds, macdh, rsi, boll
- Use case: trend confirmation (SMA/EMA), momentum (MACD family + RSI), and volatility/mean reversion context ( Boll middle)

Markdown table: key takeaways and interpretation guide
| Indicator | What it measures | How to read in NFLX context | Practical signal cues |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend baseline | Price above/below 50SMA indicates trending direction; cross with price action informs continuation or reversal risk | Bullish if price > 50SMA and above 200SMA; bearish if price < both; crossovers suggest trend shifts |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms broader regime; cross with 50SMA signals longer-cycle changes | Golden cross (50SMA above 200SMA) vs death cross (50SMA below 200SMA) |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum proxy | Quick read on immediate price momentum; complements longer SMAs | Price above 10EMA signals near-term bullishness; pullbacks to/near 10EMA can offer entry points |
| macd | Momentum and trend strength | MACD line vs signal and histogram tell direction and strength | MACD above signal with rising histogram = bullish; crossing below signals potential reversal or weakness |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoother view of MACD trend changes | Crossover of MACD above MACDS supports moves; cross below indicates potential fade |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum magnitude and acceleration | Rising positive histogram = momentum buildup; negative or shrinking histogram warns of waning momentum |
| rsi | Relative strength (momentum) | Overbought/oversold context with caveats in trending markets | RSI > 70 overbought risk; RSI < 30 oversold risk; divergence with price is a warning sign |
| boll | Bollinger middle line (20SMA) | Dynamic mean reversion and volatility framing | Price staying above middle line supports uptrend; testing/closing near/through middle line can indicate pullback or continuation depending on other signals |

If you want me to proceed with more concrete, data-driven interpretation, please confirm that I should keep retrying the data fetch for NFLX, and I will update you with the latest data-derived insights as soon as I can access the CSV.
