Sorry—the data retrieval attempt for NFLX ran into an internal error (FileNotFoundError) across all the tools I tried. I can’t fetch insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the latest financial statements right now.

Here are your options to move forward:

- Retry now: I can re-attempt to pull the five data sources (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) and then assemble the full report with a detailed, trader-focused analysis and a concluding Markdown table.

- Qualitative analysis in the meantime: I can provide a thorough, trader-oriented narrative about NFLX fundamentals using publicly known themes (business model, competitive positioning, content strategy, cash flow discipline, balance sheet health, and typical risk factors) without pulling exact numbers. I’ll clearly note where data is missing and suggest what to watch when the data comes back.

- Data you provide: If you have recent figures or CSV/summary data from these sources, share them and I’ll turn them into a complete report with insights.

If you’d like, I’ll proceed with option 1 (retry now) and deliver the full report as soon as the data tools respond. Just say “Retry now” or pick an option above.
