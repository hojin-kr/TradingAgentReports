Thanks for the nudge. Quick status and what I can do next:

- I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for NFLX (ticker NFLX) for 2025-09-23, but the tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError). I don’t have a working Reddit stream right now to pull daily sentiment granularity.

What you can do next (choose one):
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data pull now (hope the backend recovers shortly) and then deliver a full, data-driven long report.
- Option B: I proceed with a high-quality, structured long report outline and fill in data as soon as Reddit data becomes available (or if you authorize another data source you’d like me to pull from).
- Option C: I draft the full report now using a robust framework and placeholders for sentiment metrics, then populate them once the data tool comes back online.

In the meantime, here’s a ready-to-use long-report structure for NFLX (past week) and a Markdown table you can drop data into. This will be useful regardless of the data source and helps traders see where the most important signals lie.

  - High-level takeaway on sentiment, news catalysts, and potential implications for traders.

- Daily Sentiment Snapshot (7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment scores (if available) and top topics driving changes.
- Key News & Catalysts (last 7 days)
  - Company announcements (new content deals, product features, pricing, earnings hints, CFO/exec moves).

  - User metrics signals: implied fan sentiment around user growth, engagement, churn (qualitative if hard data isn’t available).
- Sentiment–Catalyst Implications for Traders
  - Short-term vs. mid-term implications; possible vol drivers (content release dates, quarterly cadence, regulatory or policy shifts).

  - Identified risks (e.g., subscriber churn, content cost pressures, regulatory scrutiny) and potential upside catalysts.
- Trader’s Takeaways and Scenarios
  - If sentiment remains positive, potential bullish scenarios; if negative sentiment escalates, potential downside scenarios.

If you want me to proceed right now, I can:
- Go with Option A (retry the Reddit data now and deliver a data-backed long report as soon as it returns).
- Or go with Option B/C (provide the fully structured, analysis-driven report framework now, with placeholders for sentiment metrics to be filled in when data is available).

Tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry immediately, I’ll run another fetch and begin integrating the Reddit sentiment results into the report as soon as the tool responds.
