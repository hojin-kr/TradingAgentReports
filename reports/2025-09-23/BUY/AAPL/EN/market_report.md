Sorry — I tried to fetch AAPL data with get_YFin_data but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (CSV source not found in the environment). I can retry fetching the data now, or we can adjust the date range (e.g., last 12–18 months) or use a shorter window to get a quick read. In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of indicators and how I would use them once we have the data. This plan aims to give you diverse, complementary insights without redundancy (up to 8 indicators).

Selected indicators (8)
1) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- How to use: Look for price above/below the 50 SMA for trend direction; use SMA crossovers with price for potential entries/exits. In conjunction with 200 SMA, it helps confirm secular trends.

2) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify golden/death cross setups.
- How to use: Price above 200 SMA indicates longer-term bullishness; price below indicates bearishness. Crossovers with price or with the 50 SMA provide stronger confirmations when aligned with other signals.

3) close_10_ema
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells: Responsive short-term momentum signal.
- How to use: Use for quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Prone to noise, so it’s best used with longer-term indicators (like the 50/200 SMA) for filtering.

4) macd
- Category: MACD Related
- What it tells: Momentum and trend changes via differences of EMAs.
- How to use: Look for MACD line crossing the signal line, bullish/bearish crossovers, and divergence with price to anticipate trend changes. Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.

5) macds
- Category: MACD Related
- What it tells: MACD signal line dynamics (EMA of MACD).
- How to use: Crossovers of MACD with MACDS to trigger trades; helps reduce false signals from MACD alone.

6) macdh
- Category: MACD Related
- What it tells: Momentum strength via MACD histogram.
- How to use: Rising histogram suggests increasing momentum; shrinking/negative histogram implies weakening momentum. Look for divergences between MACD histogram and price for early warning of reversals.

7) rsi
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- What it tells: Momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
- How to use: Monitor around 70/30 thresholds and look for bullish/bearish divergences with price. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; cross-check with trend analysis and MACD.

8) atr
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it tells: Market volatility level, useful for risk management.
- How to use: Use ATR to set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizing based on current volatility. Rising ATR suggests larger price swings ahead; use with other trend/momentum signals to calibrate entries and exits.

Notes on context for AAPL (based on typical patterns and recent market dynamics):
- In tech and large-cap growth stocks like AAPL, cross-confirmation is crucial. Relying on a single indicator often leads to whipsaws in volatile episodes (e.g., during earnings moves or macro shifts).
- The combination above gives you: trend (50/200 SMA), timely momentum (10 EMA, MACD family), momentum strength (MACD histogram), overbought/oversold context (RSI), and volatility-based risk control (ATR).
- If price consistently trades above both 50 and 200 SMA with MACD bullish cross and rising histogram, you’d expect a sustained uptrend; RSI should generally stay above 50 but not extreme unless supported by macro/momentum drivers. If ATR spikes, prepare for wider swings and adjust stops accordingly.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report describing the current alignment of these indicators for AAPL, including:
  - Trend confirmation or divergence across the 50/200 SMA framework.
  - MACD/macdhs signals and whether they corroborate price action.
  - RSI position and any divergences with price.
  - ATR-driven volatility context and its implications for risk management.
  - Any multi-indicator confirmations or contradictions that suggest entry/exit opportunities, with well-defined scenarios and potential actions.

Next steps for you
- Would you like me to retry fetching the data with the same date range (2024-09-23 to 2025-09-23) or adjust to a shorter window (e.g., last 12 months) to get a quick read?
- If you prefer, specify a date range, and I’ll pull data and generate the full 8-indicator analysis report immediately.

Markdown table: Key indicators and usage (reference)
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret for AAPL | How to act (when signals align) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50 SMA suggests uptrend; price below suggests downtrend | Consider long entries if price holds above 50 SMA and is above 200 SMA; use as smoothing filter for entries |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200 SMA indicates long-term bullishness; below indicates bearishness | Use as higher-timeframe bias; prefer long trades when price is above 200 SMA and aligns with other signals |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick momentum shifts; may generate early entry signals | Use for early entries in conjunction with longer-term trend (50/200 SMA) to filter noise |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum/trend changes via EMAs | Bullish/bearish crossovers signal potential trend changes | Trigger trades when MACD crosses its signal line and confirms with price action and RSI/momentum |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line dynamics | Crossovers with MACD add confirmation to momentum shifts | Use as a secondary confirmation to MACD line crossings from price action |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength | Histogram rising = strengthening momentum; falling = weakening | Use to gauge strength of a move; divergences with price can warn reversals |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum and overbought/oversold | RSI around >70 overbought, <30 oversold; divergences signal reversals | Avoid overtrading in strong trends; use divergences and cross with trend indicators for entries |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level | Higher ATR means larger price swings; lower ATR means steadier moves | Use for stop placement and position sizing; adjust risk management as volatility changes |

If you’d like, I can retry fetch now with the same dates or adjust the window and proceed with generating the full, detailed report as soon as data is retrieved. Please tell me which option you prefer.
