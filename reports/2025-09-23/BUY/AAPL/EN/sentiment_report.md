I’m hitting a tool error right now: the Reddit stock info fetch for AAPL on 2025-09-23 returns FileNotFoundError, so I can’t pull the latest social sentiment data from that source at the moment. I can retry in a bit, or proceed with a structured qualitative plan and a placeholder table so we’re ready to fill in when the data tool is available again.

If you’d like, I can proceed with one of these options:
- Retry now and report back with the Reddit sentiment data when the tool works.
- Move forward with a detailed, data-agnostic analysis framework (sentiment methodology, sources to monitor, potential trader implications) and a Markdown table skeleton to organize key points. This can be filled in as soon as the data feed is live.

Here’s a thorough plan and a ready-to-fill skeleton you can use for the upcoming long report on AAPL, focusing on social media sentiment, recent news, and implications for traders.

Proposed structure for the long report
- Executive summary
  - High-level sentiment direction (positive/negative/mixed) and immediate implications for AAPL price action.
  - Key catalysts or risks to watch over the next 1–7 days.
- Data sources and methodology
  - Social media: Reddit (primary, e.g., r/Apple, r/investing), X/Twitter, StockTwits, YouTube comments.
  - News and blogs: major outlets, press releases, product rumors, regulatory updates.
  - Sentiment scoring approach: counts of positive/negative/neutral posts, engagement-weighted sentiment, topical themes.
  - Time window: last 7 days (and daily breakdowns if data allows).
  - Limitations: data quality, potential trolling, sample bias, API rate limits.
- Daily sentiment and themes (past 7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral) with a concise interpretation.
  - Top themes driving sentiment each day (e.g., product rumors, supply chain, earnings expectations, regulatory news, autonomous/AI-related topics, services growth).
  - Notable spikes linked to specific posts, headlines, or press releases.
- News highlights and their sentiment/impact
  - Summaries of the most impactful news items in the window and the market reaction (if available).
  - Any notable shifts in sentiment after major headlines (e.g., product announcements, regulatory developments, legal news).
- Sentiment drivers and risk factors
  - What’s driving sentiment (product cycle expectations, services expansion, margins, capital returns, geopolitical/regulatory risk).
  - Key risks that could flip sentiment (e.g., weaker iPhone cycle, supply chain news, antitrust/regulatory scrutiny, macro tech sell-offs).
- Trader implications and strategic ideas
  - Short-term (0–5 days): sentiment-driven volatility, potential entry/exit windows, volatility considerations around earnings or product events.
  - Medium-term (weeks): trend confirmation, mean reversion vs. breakout signals depending on sentiment momentum.
  - Risk controls: position sizing ideas, hedging strategies, stop placement guidance in a sentiment-driven regime.
- Data quality, transparency, and next steps
  - How data quality is evaluated and what would cause revisions.
  - Next data pulls, refresh cadence, and how to incorporate new inputs.
