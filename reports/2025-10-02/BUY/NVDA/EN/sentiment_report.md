Thanks for the prompt. I’m running into an error with the Reddit stock info tool right now.

Status:
- Tool: get_reddit_stock_info
- Ticker: NVDA
- Date: 2025-10-02
- Error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory)

What this means:
- I can’t fetch Reddit-based sentiment/news data for NVDA at the moment due to a backend/tool issue. I don’t want to guess or fabricate data.

Options to proceed:
1) Retry now or after a short interval to see if the tool comes back online.
2) Proceed with a best-effort analysis that relies on other sources (e.g., general news headlines, official NVDA releases, and public sentiment signals) if you’re OK with me outlining the framework and placeholders until the Reddit feed is available.
3) If you have another data source/tool I can access for sentiment (besides the Reddit tool), I can bring that in immediately.

What I can deliver right now (even without Reddit data):
- A detailed framework for NVDA sentiment and the implications for traders, covering:
  - Daily sentiment drivers (AI demand news, data center cycle, supply chain updates, regulatory/policy signals).
  - Key recent news themes (product launches, partnerships, earnings cadence, guidance shifts).
  - Potential risk factors (chip supply, competition, augments to AI accelerator demand, geopolitical/regulatory issues).
  - Price/action context (how sentiment tends to map to intraday moves, option activity cues if available).
  - Tactical implications for traders (entry/exit windows, risk controls, sector rotation signals).

If you’d like me to proceed with option 2, I’ll draft the full long-form NVDA sentiment report and append a Markdown table at the end that summarizes the key points (drivers, sentiment direction, news signals, and trading implications). I’ll also structure it so you can drop in the Reddit sentiment data as soon as the tool becomes available again.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry the Reddit tool now
- Proceed with the best-effort framework (no Reddit data yet)
- Provide an alternative data source I should use (if you have one)
