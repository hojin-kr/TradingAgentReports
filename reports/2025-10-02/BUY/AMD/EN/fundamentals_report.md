I ran into a tool error while trying to fetch AMD’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin financials. The environment returned FileNotFoundError for all requested data sources, so I don’t have the latest numbers to compile a full, data-backed fundamental report right now.

Options to proceed
- Option A: Retry data fetch now. I’ll attempt the same tool calls again (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) and then build the full report with the latest figures.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals write-up based on AMD’s public history up to 2025-10-02, clearly noting that I don’t have the latest numeric figures from the data tools. This would include strategic context, business mix, and risk/catalyst considerations, but without precise current-quarter numbers.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like, I can proceed with Option A (retry) right away and report back with a complete data-backed AMD fundamentals report as soon as I can fetch the numbers.

In the meantime, here is a high-level, non-numeric AMD fundamentals outline to inform traders, plus a structure for the report you’ll get once the data pulls succeed.

High-level AMD fundamentals (non-numeric, context-focused)
- Business profile: AMD designs and sells high-performance microprocessors, GPUs, and related technologies for computing, gaming, data centers, and embedded markets. Its product cadence spans CPUs (Zen/EPYC/Ryzen), GPUs (RDNA architectures, Radeon), and accelerators for AI/ML workloads.
- Market positioning: Strong visibility in data-center CPUs/GPUs and AI accelerator demand, with ongoing competition primarily from Nvidia in GPUs and various CPU/SoC vendors in data center and client PC segments. AMD’s success hinges on product cadence, supply constraints, and AI-related compute demand.
- Growth drivers:
  - Data center and AI compute demand: Incremental demand for high-core-count CPUs (EPYC) and accelerators for training/inference workloads.
  - Product mix improvements: Margin impact from a favorable mix of high-end server CPUs and datacenter GPUs.
  - Intel competition dynamics and AMD’s process technology transitions (e.g., leveraging leading-edge manufacturing partners) can shape growth and pricing power.
  - Client PC and gaming cycles: GPU demand tied to new game titles, ray tracing, and performance upgrades in consumer segments.
- Key risk factors:
  - Cyclical capital expenditure in data centers and PC markets can cause revenue fluctuations.
  - Supply chain and wafer/SOC manufacturing constraints; reliance on foundry partners can affect timelines and costs.
  - Competitive dynamics in GPUs, AI accelerators, and server CPUs; pricing pressure in mature segments.
  - Dependence on third-party intellectual property licenses, software ecosystem alignment, and latency to market with next-gen products.
- Valuation considerations (non-numeric): Investors often weigh AMD’s growth runway in data center/AI against competitive threats and near-term demand volatility. The stock tends to react to quarterly AI/enterprise demand signals, product launch cycles, and any commentary about supply/demand balance from management.
- Catalysts to watch:
  - Announcements of new data-center CPUs/GPUs and AI accelerators.
  - Progress updates on manufacturing/program partnerships and yield improvements.
  - Quarterly compute demand signals from data center customers and gaming/consumer demand trends.
  - Any updates on free cash flow generation and capital allocation (share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions).

Report structure you’ll receive (once data is fetched)
- Executive snapshot: one-page overview with key takeaways, current quarter highlights, and a quick risk/benefit assessment.
- Company profile: business segments, markets served, geographic exposure, and competitive positioning.
- Basic financials (latest quarter/annual): revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, and notable margin trends.
- Balance sheet: assets, liabilities, cash & equivalents, debt levels, liquidity metrics.
- Cash flow: operating cash flow, investing activities, financing activities, and free cash flow.
- Income statement detail: revenue by segment (if available), cost of goods sold, SG&A, operating income, non-operating items, taxes.
- Insider sentiment: summary of public sentiment over the past 15 days and notable patterns.
- Insider transactions: summary of insider buys/sells over the past 15 days, with context where available.
- Historical trend analysis: short history of revenue, margins, and cash flow (with caveats about data quality and quarterly volatility).
- Risk and catalyst matrix: bullets on identified threats and potential positive triggers.
- Quantitative snapshot table (Markdown): a concise table of the key figures and metrics.
- Appendices: data sources and definitions, methodology notes.

If you’d like me to proceed, tell me which path you want:
- Retry (Option A): I’ll re-run the data fetch now and then build the complete, data-driven AMD fundamentals report.
- Qualitative (Option B): I’ll deliver a thorough AMD fundamentals write-up with insights and context, clearly marking where numeric data is missing due to tool access issues.

I’m ready to proceed with either option as soon as you confirm.
