I attempted to fetch Reddit stock data for AMD for 2025-10-02, but the tool returned an internal FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data fetch, or proceed using alternative sources (official AMD news, earnings/PRs, mainstream media coverage, and sentiment from other social channels). Please choose one:

Options
- Retry now: I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull for AMD again and then continue with the full long report once I have that data.
- Proceed with alternatives: I’ll compile a comprehensive AMD report using available news and sentiment data from sources other than Reddit (e.g., press releases, earnings calls, Reuters/Bloomberg/CNBC, Twitter/X, StockTwits), and note any data gaps due to the Reddit tool issue. I will still deliver a detailed, trader-oriented analysis with granular insights and a Markdown table at the end.

What I’ll deliver in either case
- A thorough analysis of AMD’s state from the past week, focusing on social sentiment (by day, where data is available), recent company news, and implications for traders and investors.
- Fine-grained insights: drivers of sentiment (AI/gaming/data-center demand, supply constraints, competitive dynamics), potential catalysts, and risk/uncertainty factors.
- Actionable takeaways and a tactical view (if warranted) with a clear risk-reward framing.
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points (sentiment, news, catalysts, risks, and trading implications).

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to proceed with the retry, I’ll run it immediately and then continue with the full report.
