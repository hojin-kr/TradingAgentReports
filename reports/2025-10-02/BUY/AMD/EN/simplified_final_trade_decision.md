# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD could benefit from a multi-year AI compute cycle across CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators, with open software and enterprise traction. A disciplined, staged entry reduces risk while pursuing long-term AI demand.

## Investment Decision
Buy. Confidence: High.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Long-term AI demand: Growing need for AI compute across CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators, supported by an open software ecosystem and enterprise traction.
- Differentiated AMD stack: EPYC servers, MI accelerators, and the ROCm open software stack form a unique combination that can lower total ownership costs and enable mixed workloads, even if Nvidia remains dominant in many large deployments.
- Diversified catalysts reduce risk: A staged, gate-based entry with explicit, independent triggers lowers timing risk and avoids relying on a single event.
- Real demand and deployment potential: Enterprise partnerships and broader AI infrastructure momentum suggest practical use cases and revenue visibility beyond a few hyperscalers.
- Risk controls support upside: Stop-loss levels, staged sizing, hedging, and milestones tied to independent benchmarks and measurable deployments help protect capital while pursuing upside.

## Risks To Watch
- Nvidia’s dominance in large workloads could limit AMD’s share gains.
- Execution risk around Zen 6 interconnect and ROCm adoption; delays could weaken the thesis.
- Macro/AI capex shifts or slower enterprise adoption could dampen revenue growth.
- Dependency on catalysts: if independent benchmarks or enterprise wins are slower to materialize, upside may hinge on timing.
- Foundry diversification progress may slow, impacting perceived risk and growth trajectory.
- Margin and revenue visibility: sustained profitability depends on meaningful data-center demand and favorable mix.
