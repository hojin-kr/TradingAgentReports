I attempted to fetch AMD data with the available tool, but the data retrieval step is currently returning a FileNotFoundError from the environment. I retried with a later date window, but the issue persists. This looks like a tooling environment problem rather than a data issue on your end. Once the data fetch is functioning, I can pull the actual indicators and provide a data-backed, granular review. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen, non-redundant set of indicators (up to 8) that are well-suited for AMD given its market dynamics (semiconductors, AI-driven demand cycles, earnings volatility, and sensitivity to macro news).

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Why these are suitable for AMD (context and rationale)
- Trend and direction (short/medium/long-term): close_10_ema, close_50_sma, close_200_sma provide a layered view of momentum and trend across different horizons. This helps distinguish short-lived moves from more durable directional shifts, which is important in a stock like AMD that often experiences episodic volatility around earnings and product announcements.
- Momentum confirmation: macd and macds capture momentum shifts and potential trend changes via MACD line vs. signal line dynamics. Using both lines helps validate crossovers and reduce false signals in a volatile name like AMD.
- Momentum strength: RSI helps identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals, particularly when price is in a pronounced uptrend or downtrend. In AMD, momentum can extend beyond typical RSI thresholds during high-enthusiasm periods (e.g., AI/CPU/GPU demand cycles), so corroboration with trend indicators is essential.
- Volatility risk management: ATR provides a robust read on current volatility, which is critical for setting stops and sizing positions around AMD’s earnings cadence and AI-driven demand news.
- Volume-supported moves: VWMA adds a volume-filtered perspective to confirm price moves. AMD often experiences volume surges around catalysts (earnings, product launches, AI demand news), so volume-adjusted trends help separate genuine institutional interest from mere price noise.

How to interpret signals once data is available (high level)
- Uptrend with expanding momentum: price above 50/200 SMAs, 10-EMA above price, MACD above signal with rising histogram, RSI in a bullish zone but not overbought, ATR showing elevated but manageable volatility, VWMA confirming with rising volume.
- Momentum divergence or rollover: MACD line crossing below the signal, MACD histogram turning negative, RSI failing to make new highs on an up-price move, potential pullback especially if ATR declines (lower volatility) and VWMA weakens.
- Breakouts or pullbacks in a volatile environment: Use VWMA and ATR together to gauge whether price moves are supported by volume and whether volatility is rising (breakouts) or contracting (potential consolidation). Confirm with MACD and RSI to avoid false breakouts.

Next steps (once data retrieval is functioning)
- I will fetch AMD price data for the requested window and compute the 8 indicators listed above.
- I will then deliver a detailed, trend- and signal-specific write-up, including:
  - Current trend context (short/medium/long-term)
  - Momentum shifts and signal confirmations
  - Volatility and risk management cues
  - Volume-confirmed moves to watch for continuation or reversals
  - A concise actionable takeaway (no hard buy/sell/hold without your direction, but with signal-driven guidance)

Proposed quick-reference interpretation table (conceptual)
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum, recent price velocity
  - How to use: Watch for price crossing above/below for entry/exit hints; use with longer-term trend filters
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend
  - How to use: Price above/below as trend confirmation; use as dynamic support/resistance
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - What it measures: Long-term trend
  - How to use: Golden/death cross signals; strategic trend confirmation
- Indicator: macd
  - What it measures: Momentum shifts via EMA differences
  - How to use: Crossovers and divergence relative to price trend
- Indicator: macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line smoothing
  - How to use: Cross with MACD line to trigger signals; reduce false positives
- Indicator: rsi
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum and overbought/oversold state
  - How to use: Watch for overbought/oversold with trend context; look for divergence
- Indicator: atr
  - What it measures: Market volatility
  - How to use: Position sizing and stop placement; adapt risk to current volatility
- Indicator: vwma
  - What it measures: Price action filtered by traded volume
  - How to use: Confirm price moves with volume; identify genuine breakouts/strength

Markdown table: key points
| Indicator | What it measures | How to use for AMD | Why it’s useful for AMD now |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Look for quick shifts; use with longer-term filters | Captures fast moves around earnings/news in a volatile stock |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Confirm trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Balances short-term swings with a broader trend view |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Confirm overall market direction; watch for crossovers | Helps distinguish cyclical pullbacks from structural trend shifts |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Crossover/divergence signals | Validates momentum shifts in AI/volatility-driven headlines |
| macds | MACD signal line smoothing | Cross with MACD for entries/exits | Reduces false signals in choppy periods |
| rsi | Momentum strength/overbought-oversold | Divergence and zone checks with trend context | Flags potential reversals in strong uptrends |
| atr | Market volatility | Guide stop placement and position sizing | Critical for earnings-driven volatility and risk management |
| vwma | Volume-adjusted price action | Confirm moves with volume; validate breakouts | AMD often moves on catalysts; volume-trend confirmation is valuable |

Important note
- I could not run the data fetch due to the current tool issue. If you’d like, I can retry as soon as the tool environment is back up, or we can proceed with a smaller subset of indicators that don’t require live data for a qualitative view. Once data access is restored, I’ll return a full, data-backed analysis with the exact signals and an actionable take based on AMD’s current setup.
