Recommendation: Buy (with disciplined, staged entry and strict risk controls)

Rationale
- The plan emphasizes multi-year AI tailwinds across CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators, with open software and enterprise traction that could capture workloads where total cost of ownership matters.
- AMD’s differentiated stack (EPYC + MI + ROCm) and near-term product cadence (Zen 6, AFMF3, RDNA5) present credible upside if benchmarks and enterprise deployments validate the anticipated efficiency and performance gains.
- Diversified demand signals (enterprise partnerships, field benchmarks, and potential foundry diversification) support a more resilient growth profile despite near-term execution and supply risks.

Execution plan (tranche-based entry)
- Tranche 1: 25% of target position now.
- Tranche 2: 25% after credible near-term catalyst verification (e.g., independent benchmarks showing material Zen 6/AFMF3 uplift or a verifiable enterprise win with revenue visibility).
- Tranche 3: 50% on confirmed, sustained AI workload deployments and/or a clear step-up in ROCm ecosystem adoption with measurable revenue/margin impact.

Catalysts and signals to act on
- Independent benchmarks and field tests confirming Zen 6 interconnect and RDNA5 gains.
- Verifiable enterprise deployments with disclosed run-rate impact (contracts, pilots, or production deployments).
- Progress on foundry diversification (TSMC dependence easing, credible terms with alternative fabs).
- Security, reliability milestones reducing enterprise risk and boosting adoption.
- Macro/AI capex stability signals (cloud pricing trends, hyperscaler upgrade cycles).

Risk management and exits
- Stop-loss per tranche: 15-20% below each tranche’s entry price.
- Position sizing cap: initial 2-6% of the portfolio for AMD, scalable with catalysts.
- Valuation surveillance: trim exposure if multiple catalysts falter or multiple-quarter results miss expectations.
- Negative catalysts to monitor: delays in Zen 6/AFMF3 benchmarks, absence of credible enterprise deals, or worsening single-foundry constraints.

Time horizon and metrics
- Horizon: 2–5 years to capture AI compute tailwinds.
- Metrics: benchmark validation, mix of data-center vs gaming/PC revenue, enterprise contract counts/run-rate, gross margin impact from MI GPUs and data-center CPU/accelerator sales, and progress on foundry diversification.

Final note
- The plan requires verification of catalysts and disciplined execution with risk controls. If catalysts accelerate or margins show meaningful improvement, consider increasing exposure; if they deteriorate, reassess quickly.
