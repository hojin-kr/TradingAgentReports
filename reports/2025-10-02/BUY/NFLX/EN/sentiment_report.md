Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based stock news for NFLX on 2025-10-02, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal environment issue). It looks like the Reddit data retrieval component is currently failing here.

What I suggest we do next
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch momentarily (the issue may be transient).
- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort, structured analysis using other sources and a framework you can fill in once the Reddit data tool is back online.
- Option C: Wait for the tool to be fixed and I’ll run the full Reddit+news sentiment analysis immediately.

If you’d like me to proceed now with Option B (a robust, structured analysis without the Reddit feed), I can deliver:
- A detailed sentiment and thematic framework for NFLX (Netflix) based on public sentiment signals and recent news up to today, clearly labeled as qualitative when Reddit data is unavailable.
- A plan for converting that into a data-driven report once the Reddit tool is functioning again.
- A Markdown table at the end that summarizes key themes, potential catalysts, and risk signals for traders.

Proposed plan for the report (to be filled with data once available)
- Overview: current sentiment posture (bullish/bearish/mixed) and how it’s evolved over the past week.
- Social media signal analysis:
  - Core themes: pricing/tier changes (ads tier), content slate, international expansion, platform-specific issues (crashs, skips, or DVR features), competition (Disney+/Prime Video, etc.), and AI-driven production discussions.
  - Tone shifts by day: spikes in positive/negative mentions, notable viral posts, influencer chatter.
- News signals (recent company/news coverage):
  - Earnings or guidance notes, content deals, subscriber updates, ad-supported tier performance, regulatory/compliance items, macro factors (ads market, streaming competition).
- Sentiment drivers by day (if available): what drove sentiment on each day (new releases, price changes, earnings hints, regulatory news, etc.).
- Risk and catalyst assessment for traders:
  - Bullish catalysts: stronger than expected ARPU growth, favorable international subscriber momentum, successful ad-supported tier adoption, big content wins.
  - Bearish catalysts: higher churn risk after price changes, disappointing content slate, adverse regulatory/competitive headwinds.
- Quantitative framing (where possible): structure for a sentiment delta, post volume, and notable post mentions, with placeholders if data is pending.
- Takeaways for positioning: potential trade ideas with caveats, risk management flags, and scenarios.

If you want me to proceed with Option B right away, say “Proceed with qualitative NFLX analysis.” If you’d rather wait for the Reddit tool to come back online, I’ll run the full Reddit+news sentiment report as soon as it’s available and deliver the long-form analysis plus a final Markdown table.

Would you like me to proceed with Option B now, or should I wait for the Reddit data tool to be fixed?
