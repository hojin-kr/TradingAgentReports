I attempted to fetch NFLX data with get_YFin_data for 2024-10-02 to 2025-10-02, but the tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I retried, and it failed again. It looks like the data backend isn’t accessible right now. I can:

- Retry immediately, or
- Try a shorter or different date window, or
- Proceed with a plan and prepare the indicator setup so I’m ready to run as soon as data access is restored.

In the meantime, I’ve prepared a concrete plan with the eight most relevant indicators that provide complementary insights for NFLX, along with why they’re suitable. Once the data fetch works, I’ll run these indicators and produce a detailed, nuanced report with trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context.

Selected indicators (up to 8) and rationale for NFLX
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - Purpose: Identify the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance; helps filter short-term noise when evaluating NFLX’s price action.
  - Why NFLX: As a high-variance growth stock, the 50-SMA often aligns with meaningful pullbacks or rallies in a multi-quarter horizon.

- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - Purpose: Establish the long-term trend benchmark and observe golden/death cross tendencies.
  - Why NFLX: Provides a macro view of whether the stock is in a broader uptrend or downtrend, useful for position sizing and risk tolerance.

- close_10_ema (10-period exponential moving average)
  - Purpose: Capture quick momentum shifts and potential near-term entries.
  - Why NFLX: In volatile periods, the 10-EMA reacts faster than older averages and can signal early momentum changes when used with longer-term trends.

- macd (MACD line)
  - Purpose: Momentum indicator showing differences between two EMAs; used for trend-change signals.
  - Why NFLX: Helps identify shifts in velocity of price moves, especially around earnings events or catalysts.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Purpose: Smoothing of the MACD; MACD crossing above/below the signal line generates potential trade signals.
  - Why NFLX: Adds a confirmation layer to MACD-derived entries/exits, reducing false positives in choppy markets.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Purpose: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence between MACD and its signal.
  - Why NFLX: Divergence with price can hint at weakening or strengthening momentum ahead of price reversals.

- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - Purpose: Momentum gauge showing overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals.
  - Why NFLX: Helps flag extreme conditions and potential retracements, especially when aligned with trend indicators (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA).

- vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
  - Purpose: Confirms price action with volume by weighting the price by traded volume.
  - Why NFLX: Volume-driven confirmation is valuable for a stock that often moves on earnings, guidance, or subscriber data; helps distinguish genuine breakouts from low-volume spikes.

Notes on usage and interpretation (when data is available)
- Use a multi-timeframe mindset: confirm signals from the MACD/RSI with the trend direction from the 50 and 200 SMAs.
- Look for:
  - Trend alignment: Price above both 50-SMA and 200-SMA suggests a bullish context; price below both suggests bearish context.
  - Momentum crossovers: MACD crossing the MACD Signal line (and MACD Histogram shifting) can indicate trend acceleration or fading.
  - RSI confirmations: RSI breaking out of overbought/oversold regions in the direction of the trend adds strength to signals; be mindful of RSI remaining extreme in a strong uptrend.
  - Volume validation: VWMA confirming price moves increases conviction; rising price on rising VWMA is stronger than price move on flat/low volume.
- Risk management: If using these indicators to position size, consider ATR (volatility) and/or dynamic position sizing alongside VWMA signals to adjust for changing volatility. Note: ATR is not in the final eight to avoid redundancy, but it can be added later for risk controls if needed.

Next steps (what I will do as soon as data access is restored)
- Retrieve NFLX price data for the requested period.
- Compute the eight indicators listed above.
- Produce a detailed, nuanced report:
  - Summary of current trend alignment across 50/200 SMAs.
  - Momentum analysis from MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram.
  - Short-term momentum from the 10-EMA in relation to price and longer-term trend.
  - RSI positioning and any divergences.
  - Volume confirmation via VWMA.
  - Potential entry/exit signals with rationale and caveats.
  - Risk considerations and suggested stop/position sizing guidance.

If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now, or you can specify a different date window (e.g., the last 6–12 months) or a shorter range to improve the chance of a successful data pull. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.
