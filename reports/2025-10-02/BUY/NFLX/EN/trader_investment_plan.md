Here is a concise, action-ready decision aligned with the proposed plan for NFLX.

Recommendation
- Primary stance: Buy NFLX with a staged, risk-controlled entry.

Rationale
- The bull case rests on durable growth drivers (international ARPU expansion, meaningful ad-tier monetization, and a scalable content flywheel) that can improve top-line growth and unit economics over time.
- Bear risks are addressable through disciplined risk controls: hedge exposure to earnings volatility, implement a staged entry, and deploy capital gradually to avoid full exposure on a single catalyst.
- The eight-indicator framework is a strong conditional guardrail: meaningful conviction rises if data confirms price above the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, MACD positive with widening histogram, constructive RSI, and VWMA volume confirmation on up-days.

Position sizing and risk controls
- Initial core exposure: 2–3% of portfolio.
- Upsize target: Scale to 5–7% total NFLX exposure if catalysts materialize and the eight-indicator read is favorable.
- Downside protection: Use a hedge (collar or protective puts) to cap downside while preserving upside optionality; target cost-efficient protection in line with liquidity and IV.
- Kill-switch: If EBITDA margin does not show improvement within the next two quarters or if ad-tier contributions lag meaningfully, reduce exposure or reassess promptly. Also exit on a strong technical break below the established trend lines or critical moving averages.

Entry framework and data requirements
- Step 1: Initiate or add on a staged basis when price confirms:
  - Price above both 50-day and 200-day SMAs
  - MACD positive with histogram expanding
  - RSI constructive (not overbought)
  - Short-term momentum: price above 10-EMA
  - Volume: VWMA rising on up-days
- Step 2: Validate with catalysts: earnings cadence, ad-tier monetization progress, international subscriber momentum, ARPU trends.
- Step 3: Implement a kill-switch and a formal review cadence (4–8 weeks after data availability) to reassess with updated indicators and guidance.

Catalysts watchlist
- Earnings date and guidance
- Progress on ad-supported tier monetization
- International growth metrics (subscriber momentum, ARPU, churn)
- Licensing/production milestones and regulatory environment

Lessons integrated
- Ground decisions in cash-flow realism and multi-quarter catalysts, not headlines or sentiment alone.
- Use explicit downside scenarios and kill-switches to avoid unbounded risk.
- Tie valuation to durable cash flow/EBITDA trajectories; be prepared for multiple compression if near-term profitability lags.
- Manage data gaps with a disciplined framework and reserve the right to adjust quickly when data flows resume.
- Employ hedges to protect downside while preserving upside participation.

Next steps
- I can run the concrete eight-indicator read as soon as data is available and tailor exact entry levels, stop levels, and hedging parameters to the current price and option-implied volatility.
- If you want, I can also provide a ready-to-deliver debate script with sharp bear rebuttals and a tested sell-side counter-narrative to stress-test the bull thesis.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
