I attempted to fetch SPY data with the tool, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError (no such file or directory) after multiple tries. I can retry the data fetch now, or proceed with a solid indicator framework for SPY using the 8 most complementary indicators. Here’s a detailed, action-oriented plan you can use in either case.

Selected indicators (up to 8, non-redundant and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll_ub
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for SPY
- close_50_sma (50 SMA): Captures medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for evaluating if SPY is in a broader uptrend or downtrend and for timing pullbacks within that trend.
- close_200_sma (200 SMA): Long-term trend benchmark. Helps identify macro regime (golden cross/death cross) and filter entries when the price is far from major long-term support/resistance.
- close_10_ema (10 EMA): A responsive short-term momentum proxy. Helps flag quick shifts in momentum and potential short-term entries or exits, especially in a choppy market when used with longer-term indicators.
- macd: Core momentum/trend signal. Crossovers and divergence can indicate trend changes or rollovers; works best when corroborated by price action and other filters.
- macds: MACD Signal smoothing. Using MACD and its signal line together improves reliability of momentum signals and helps avoid false entries.
- rsi: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold context. Valuable for spotting potential reversals or continuations when used with the trend context from the SMAs.
- boll_ub (Bollinger Upper Band): Signals potential overbought conditions or breakout zones, especially in a rising market. Useful to gauge how far price is pushing against volatility bands in conjunction with other signals.
- atr: Volatility gauge. Helps with risk management (position sizing, stop placement) and understanding breakout strength (rising ATR can accompany breakouts; contracting ATR can warn of consolidation).

Nuanced interpretation framework (how these indicators interact for SPY)
- Trend context: If SPY is trading above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, the longer-term trend is bullish. A price pullback toward the 50 SMA with a MACD bullish signal (MACD line crossing above MACD signal) and RSI not yet overbought can offer a favorable dip-buy setup. Conversely, if price is below both SMAs, look for MACD bearish signals and RSI to confirm downside momentum before considering shorts or hedges.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and MACD Signal should align with price action. A bullish MACD cross above the signal line, in tandem with price staying above the 50 SMA (and ideally above the 200 SMA) strengthens a long entry case. A bearish MACD cross, particularly if RSI is trending toward oversold but price remains weak, lends weight to exit or risk-off decisions.
- Volatility and risk controls: Rising ATR indicates growing volatility, which warrants wider stops but potentially larger targets. In high volatility, prefer signals that are confirmed by multiple indicators (e.g., price above 50 SMA, MACD bullish, RSI not yet overbought, and ATR rising) to justify entries. If ATR contracts while price tests key support, consider reducing size or awaiting a breakout confirmation.
- Mean reversion vs. breakout risk: RSI can signal overbought (above ~70) or oversold (below ~30). Use RSI in the context of the Bollinger band (boll_ub) as a cross-check: hitting boll_ub with RSI not extreme may indicate a stronger breakout setup rather than a mere pullback in an overbought market.
- Entry/exit discipline: Combine signals rather than rely on a single indicator. For example:
  - Long setup: Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA, MACD > 0 with MACD line crossing above signal, RSI around 50–65 (not overbought), price testing or slightly reclaiming above boll_ub with ATR rising.
  - Short setup: Price below SMAs, MACD < 0 with MACD line crossing below signal, RSI trending toward overbought (in a downtrend, avoid getting caught in a rally) and price respecting boll_lb with ATR rising.

Operational notes
- Since I’m currently facing a data retrieval issue for SPY, I can reattempt the data fetch now, or proceed with the indicator-driven plan and have the data populated once the fetch succeeds.
- If you want me to retry immediately, say “retry now” and I’ll kick off another fetch attempt. If you prefer to move forward with analysis plans right away, I’ll provide more granular signal rules and a template checklist you can apply during live trading.

Proposed signal checklist (quick-start template)
- Check trend: SPY above/below 50 SMA and 200 SMA.
- Confirm momentum: MACD and MACDS signals align with trend direction.
- Assess strength: RSI position relative to 50 and to overbought/oversold thresholds.
- Gauge volatility: ATR level vs. recent baseline; adjust stops/position size accordingly.
- Evaluate breakout potential: price near/at boll_ub with supportive MACD/RSI signals.
- Decide risk controls: position sizing based on ATR and own risk tolerance.

Appendix: Key points table
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Practical use: Confirm trend and identify pullback levels | Signals to watch: Price above/below 50 SMA; price reaction at this level
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark | Practical use: Confirm macro regime; watch for golden/death cross | Signals to watch: Price above 200 SMA in uptrend; cross with 50 SMA
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Purpose: Short-term momentum shifts | Practical use: Timely entry/exit signals | Signals to watch: Price cross above/below 10 EMA
- Indicator: macd | Purpose: Momentum/trend changes | Practical use: Trend-change triggers | Signals to watch: MACD cross and divergence with price
- Indicator: macds | Purpose: MACD signal smoothing | Practical use: Crossovers with MACD line for trades | Signals to watch: MACD > MACDS and MACD crossing above MACDS
- Indicator: rsi | Purpose: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | Practical use: Reversal or continuation cues | Signals to watch: RSI rising toward 60–70 in uptrends; divergence considerations
- Indicator: boll_ub | Purpose: Upper volatility band/overbought zone | Practical use: Breakout potential and overextension checks | Signals to watch: Price near or above boll_ub with corroboration
- Indicator: atr | Purpose: Volatility measure | Practical use: Risk management and stop placement | Signals to watch: Rising ATR with valid breakout signals; contraction signals risk-off context

Would you like me to retry the data fetch for SPY now, or proceed with this indicator framework and I’ll populate and analyze once data returns? If you prefer, I can also add one or two more indicators (e.g., boll or atr interplay) for additional perspective, up to your choice.
