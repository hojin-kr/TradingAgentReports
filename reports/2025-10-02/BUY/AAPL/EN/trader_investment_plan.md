Short answer: Buy.

Rationale (concise)
- The plan’s core thesis holds: Apple’s Services engine and high-margin ecosystem, combined with durable cash flow and AI-enabled engagement, offer multi-year upside even if near-term headwinds appear. Valuation is high, but the optionality from Services, AI monetization, and capital allocation provides a favorable risk-reward with disciplined risk controls.
- Bear risks (valuation, AI monetization durability, AR/VR ROI, macro/regulatory/china exposure) are real but manageable with staged entries and hedging. The strategy explicitly addresses these risks rather than hoping for a straight-line rally.

Concrete execution plan (actionable steps)
1) Staged entry (primary recommendation)
- Initiate with 1/3 of the intended AAPL exposure now.
- Add a second tranche over the next 4–8 weeks if:
  - Services growth signals remain robust or improve,
  - iPhone ASP/mix indicators hold steady or improve,
  - No material negative regulatory or geopolitical headlines.
- Complete the final tranche in 8–12 weeks if momentum persists and catalysts stay intact.
2) Risk controls and hedging
- Position sizing: cap single-stock exposure to a modest portion of equity capital and maintain diversification; tailor the accelerator/tranche sizes to match your risk tolerance.
- Stop/volatility protection: apply an ATR-based trailing stop to adapt to volatility; avoid rigid fixed-price stops.
- Hedging: consider a collar around near-term catalysts (earnings, major product updates) to limit downside while preserving upside. Alternatively, buy protective puts to shield against a sharp drawdown if a key risk materializes; finance with a short-dated call if you’re comfortable with limited upside in the hedge.
3) Catalyst monitoring
- Near-term catalysts: next earnings release, Services growth trajectory, iPhone mix/ASP signals, and any measurable AI monetization milestones (feature adoption, subscriber metrics).
- Ongoing metrics: Services gross margin, Services revenue growth rate, iPhone mix/ASP trends, buyback cadence, and any regulatory/China headlines. Vision Pro remains a longer-horizon signal.
4) Post-catalyst plan
- After each earnings or major data point, reassess:
  - Is Services growth accelerating, stabilizing, or decelerating?
  - Is cash flow remaining robust and capable of supporting buybacks and investments?
  - Is the iPhone cycle holding up?
- If momentum weakens materially or gross margins deteriorate, be prepared to pause additional buys, tighten risk controls, or trim exposure even if the longer-term thesis remains intact.
5) Learning and risk mitigation
- Use a multi-factor lens (Services momentum, iPhone monetization, AI uplift, cash generation, capital allocation) and quantify bear scenarios with downside ranges to avoid overconfidence.
- Maintain hedging discipline; don’t let a headline-driven selloff force an uncontrolled exit.

Notes on practicality
- This plan is designed for a multi-quarter to multi-year horizon. It accepts near-term volatility as a feature, not a bug, provided risk controls stay in place.
- If AI monetization starts to show clear, durable upside in Services or if cash generation strengthens meaningfully, consider a measured increase in exposure in subsequent tranches.

Final decision
- Final stance: Buy with a disciplined, staged entry and hedging framework.
