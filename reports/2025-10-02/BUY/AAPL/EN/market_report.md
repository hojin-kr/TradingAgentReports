I attempted to fetch AAPL data and compute the selected indicators, but the data layer returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) for Yahoo Finance data. All parallel indicator requests failed for the same reason. In short: I don’t currently have access to the underlying CSV data needed to compute the indicators in this session. I can retry, or you can provide the data file (CSV), or we can switch to an alternative data source if available.

What I can do now (plan)
- Retry data retrieval now and then compute the indicators if the data source is restored.
- If you can provide a CSV file for AAPL (date, open, high, low, close, volume), I can proceed immediately with the analysis.
- If you prefer, I can lay out a complete indicator framework using the eight most informative signals (without actual numeric outputs until data is loaded).

Selected indicators (up to 8) for AAPL and why they are complementary
1) close_50_sma
- Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why useful: Helps identify the prevailing trend and rough pullback levels; lags price but provides reliable context when used with faster signals.

2) close_200_sma
- Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and potential golden/death-cross context.
- Why useful: Confirms the dominant regime (bullish/bearish) and guards against thinking a short-term bounce is a durable trend.

3) close_10_ema
- Purpose: Short-term momentum and potential early entry points.
- Why useful: Responds quickly to price moves; best when used with longer-term averages to filter noise.

4) macd
- Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signal via EMA differences.
- Why useful: Crossovers and divergences often precede meaningful shifts; works well in conjunction with trend context from SAs.

5) macds
- Purpose: MACD signal line overlay (trigger for crossovers).
- Why useful: Helps confirm MACD-driven entries/exits; reduces false signals if used with other filters.

6) macdh
- Purpose: MACD histogram to gauge momentum strength and divergence intensity.
- Why useful: Visualizes momentum acceleration/deceleration; useful for early warning when MACD lines are converging/diverging.

7) rsi
- Purpose: Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions.
- Why useful: Complements trend signals; watch for divergence and confirm with trend/momentum context.

8) atr
- Purpose: Volatility measure to inform risk management and position sizing.
- Why useful: Helps set dynamic stops and adjust risk as market volatility changes; not a directional signal but essential for risk control.

What to watch for once data is available (nuanced framing)
- Trend context: Compare close_50_sma vs close_200_sma to determine whether AAPL is in a bullish or bearish regime. A rising 50 over a rising 200 generally supports long-only tilt; a cross of the two can signal regime changes.
- Momentum sequencing: Use macd/macds/macdh in tandem with close_10_ema. A bullish cross on MACD with price above the 50/200 SMA and a rising RSI toward but not into extreme overbought zones can indicate a higher-probability long setup; vice versa for bearish conditions.
- Momentum health vs. price extremes: RSI should be interpreted with the trend in mind. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for long periods; use MACD and price position relative to the SMAs to avoid chasing overbought prints.
- Volatility regime and risk: ATR will tell you when to widen/narrow stops and adjust position sizes. A rising ATR signals higher risk per trade; consider tighter stops or reducing exposure in those moments.
- Confirmation layering: The combination of (50_SMA/200_SMA) trend direction + MACD momentum + RSI condition + ATR volatility creates a robust decision framework that reduces reliance on any single indicator.

Proposed next steps
- Option A: I retry data retrieval now and, if successful, generate an integrated 8-indicator report with a detailed trend read and a table of actionable observations.
- Option B: You provide the AAPL CSV (date, open, high, low, close, volume). I will run the indicators immediately and deliver the full, granular report.
- Option C: If you want a quick hypothetical framework without current data, I can generate a scenario-based interpretation (e.g., “bullish breakout with rising RSI and strong MACD histogram”) but it would not reflect real-time data.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer to upload the CSV file or switch to an alternate data source? 

Key indicators summary (for quick reference)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum
- macd: Momentum/trend change
- macds: MACD signal
- macdh: MACD histogram (momentum strength)
- rsi: Overbought/oversold momentum
- atr: Volatility/risk management

Table: Key points to watch (once data is available)
| Indicator | Purpose | What to look for (example signals) | Caveats |
|-----------|---------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| close_50_sma | Trend direction / support | Price above/below 50SMA; cross with price | Lagging indicator; use with faster signals |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend / regime | Price above/below 200SMA; golden/death cross signals | Very slow; best for strategic view |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crosses above/below 10EMA; confirms with other signals | Prone to whipsaws in choppy markets |
| macd | Momentum / trend change | MACD line crossing, divergences | Needs corroboration in low-volatility regimes |
| macds | MACD signal | MACD signal line cross with MACD | Part of broader filter; avoid standalone signals |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction | Can be volatile in fast moves |
| rsi | Overbought/oversold | RSI >70 or <30; divergences | In strong trends, may remain extreme; use trend context |
| atr | Volatility / risk | Rising ATR → wider stops; falling ATR → tighter risk | Reactive measure; use with position sizing rules |

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry now, or you can provide an input (CSV or alternative data path) and I’ll deliver the full, detailed indicator report immediately.
