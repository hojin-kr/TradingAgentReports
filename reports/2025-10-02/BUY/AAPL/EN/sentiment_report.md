Sorry about that—the Reddit stock info tool is returning a FileNotFoundError on my end. I can retry shortly, or I can switch to delivering an actionable outline now and fill in the data once the tool responds. Here are two options:

Option A: Retry now
- I’ll attempt the data fetch again for AAPL on 2025-10-02 and then deliver a full, data-backed long report with sentiment trends, daily themes, and news highlights, plus a final table of key points.

Option B: Provide a detailed outline now
- I’ll produce a comprehensive framework for the report (sections, data you’ll want to capture, and how to interpret it) so you can supply or verify data as soon as the tool is available again.

If you’d like, I can also proceed with both in parallel: retry now while presenting the outline so you have something to review immediately.

What would you prefer? In the meantime, here’s the structure I’ll aim to deliver (and what data would be collected if the tool were available):
