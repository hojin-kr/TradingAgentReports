Recommendation: Buy, but with a disciplined, staged entry and explicit risk controls.

Action plan (staged entry and risk management)
- Stage 1 (now): Deploy 40% of the total target META exposure to capture the core bull thesis from AI-enabled monetization and data moat. This initiates exposure to the upside while keeping capital risk modest.
- Stage 2 (around credible catalyst): Add 20–30% of the target exposure once there is clear progress on catalysts (e.g., AI rollout metrics, ROAS improvements from targeting/creative optimization, or a tangible milestone from CoreWeave/Rivos). This leverages incremental proof of monetization and cost-reduction benefits.
- Stage 3 (post-milestone validation): Complete the remaining 20–40% after a verified uplift in monetization metrics or a material cost-savings milestone from compute initiatives, ensuring the thesis is still intact.

Hedging and risk controls
- Build a modest hedge to protect against near-term event risk: consider protective puts or a collar around the staged entries to cap downside while preserving upside in a rising scenario.
- Hard stop risk controls: implement a predefined drawdown limit (e.g., 15–20% from the entry level for the META position) to trigger reassessment, especially if catalysts disappoint or regulatory risks escalate.
- Flexibility: be prepared to pause or trim if near-term monetization progress stalls or if ad-market demand weakens meaningfully.

Key catalysts and milestones to watch
- Near-term monetization metrics: ROAS uplift from AI targeting, CPM dynamics, Reels monetization traction, cross-platform shopping uptake.
- AI compute milestones: CoreWeave utilization and cost per compute unit, early margin signals from in-house compute (Rivos roadmap milestones).
- Diversification traction: Ad-free subscriptions, Ray-Ban AR hardware monetization, and other non-ads revenue signs.
- Regulatory trajectory: Any material policy shifts or rulings in major markets affecting data usage or ad targeting.

Monitoring KPI checklist
- Monetization health: ROAS, ARPU, monetization rate by product/module (ads, subscriptions, hardware).
- Cost structure: marginal compute cost, gross margin progression, operating margin, and free cash flow progression as capex ramps.
- Catalyst progress: documented milestones and quarterly updates on AI rollout, monetization diversification, and hardware monetization.
- Risk signals: regulatory developments, ad-market demand shifts, and execution milestones.

Exit/adjustment framework
- If catalysts hit and monetization improves sustainably: scale exposure via the staged plan, potentially lifting the final tranche.
- If milestones slip or margins fail to improve despite AI investments: trim exposure, tighten hedges, or reassess the thesis toward Hold or Sell if evidence deteriorates.
- If regulatory action accelerates or ad demand deteriorates materially: promptly tighten risk controls and consider reducing exposure.

Rationale
- The bull thesis presents a multi-layer growth path: AI-driven monetization, optionality from subscriptions and hardware, and a meaningful compute-cost reduction story via in-house and partner compute. The plan accounts for regulatory risks and capex cadence with staged exposure and hedges, aiming for asymmetric upside while controlling downside.

Final takeaway
- Buy, but with a disciplined, catalyst-driven, staged approach and explicit risk controls to manage downside while chasing upside.
