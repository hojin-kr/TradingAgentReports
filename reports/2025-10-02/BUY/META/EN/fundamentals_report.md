I tried to pull the latest fundamental data for META (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) but encountered a file-not-found error from the data tools:

- get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment: FileNotFoundError
- get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions: FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_balance_sheet: FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_income_stmt: FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_cashflow: FileNotFoundError

What this means: I can’t fetch the latest data right this moment. I can retry automatically, or we can proceed with a structured qualitative analysis and a data-collection template you can reuse once the data tools are back online. Here are the two paths:

Option A – Retry now (recommended)
- I’ll retry the data pulls for META with the same parameters (quarterly cadence, curr_date 2025-10-02, 15-day insider window for sentiment/transactions).
- If successful, I’ll assemble a comprehensive fundamental report with the exact figures and granular insights you asked for (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and a detailed trader-focused interpretation).

Option B – Proceed with a structured qualitative report (no live data)
- I’ll provide a thorough framework and interpretation guidance that you can apply immediately, plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table template. Once the data tools are operational again, you or I can populate the numbers and finalize the report.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A now, I’ll try the data pulls again right away. If you prefer Option B, I’ll deliver the qualitative report framework and the Markdown table template below.

If you want Option A, I’ll attempt the data retrieval again immediately and report back with the full, data-backed report as soon as the tools return healthy.
