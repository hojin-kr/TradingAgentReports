Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch data and run the requested indicators, but I’m hitting a tool-side error right now (FileNotFoundError). The environment reports missing files when trying to retrieve Yahoo Finance data and the indicator analyses. I can retry immediately, or, if you prefer, I can lay out a detailed framework and wait for data to come through. Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here is a thorough plan and a concrete set of indicators I would use for META, along with how I’d interpret them.

Indicator selection (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify whether META is in a broader uptrend or downtrend and acts as a baseline for pullbacks.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful to confirm the overall market regime (bullish if price stays above; bearish if below) and to watch for golden/death cross contexts with other signals.
- close_10_ema: Quick momentum proxy. Captures near-term shifts and potential entry points, especially when price breaks above/below the 10 EMA in conjunction with other filters.
- macd: Momentum signal. MACD crossovers help identify changes in impulse and can align with trend direction when corroborated by price action and other indicators.
- macds: MACD Signal. The MACD line crossing the MACD signal line adds a corroboration layer to MACD-derived signals, reducing false positives in choppiness.
- rsi: Momentum/overbought-oversold insights. Highlights potential reversals or pullbacks when diverging from price action or when price reaches extreme levels (e.g., overbought in uptrends, oversold in downtrends).
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA). Acts as a volatility-aware benchmark for price positioning; helps identify baseline, breakouts, and mean-reversion tendencies when combined with bands.
- atr: Volatility-based risk context. Guides position sizing and stop placement; useful to adjust expectations during periods of elevated or contracting volatility.

Rationale and how to trade META with these indicators
- Trend framing (50SMA, 200SMA): Use the 50SMA/200SMA relationship to gauge whether META is in a bullish regime (price above both, with 50SMA above or near 200SMA) or a bearish regime (price below, or potential death/cross patterns). This helps avoid choppy long entries in a down-trending market and improves signal quality in an uptrend.
- Short-term momentum filters (10 EMA, MACD, MACD Signal): When price action is aligned with the trend, use a positive MACD cross above its signal as a momentum confirmation for entries. If MACD is diverging (price making new highs while MACD fails to confirm), treat as a potential warning sign to wait or tighten risk.
- RSI as a supplementary momentum check: In an uptrend, an RSI reaching overbought levels may indicate a pullback risk; in a downtrend, oversold readings can imply a relief rally. Use RSI with trend context rather than in isolation to avoid chasing counter-trend bounces.
- Volatility and price positioning (Bollinger Middle, ATR): Boll middle helps set expectations for mean-reversion vs breakout themes. When price trades outside the Boll bands with rising ATR, expect stronger momentum and potential continuation; when price returns inside the bands with fading ATR, anticipate consolidation.
- Practical usage pattern:
  - Bullish setup: Price above 50SMA and 200SMA, 10 EMA above price pullback, MACD line above MACD signal, RSI not in extreme overbought territory, price touching or holding above Boll middle with ATR not spiking excessively.
  - Bearish setup: Price below 50SMA and 200SMA, 10 EMA failing to maintain above price or turning down, MACD line below MACD signal with declining momentum, RSI drifting toward oversold but with price continuing to press lower, price testing or breaking below Boll middle as ATR spikes indicating widening volatility.
  - Neutral/adaptive approach: In ranges, rely more on MACD crossovers and RSI divergence in combination with Boll middle and ATR trends to avoid premature entries.

Current data status and next steps
- I’m currently unable to fetch META data and the associated indicator analyses due to a tool/file error in the environment.
- If you’d like me to proceed, I can:
  1) Retry the data fetch and indicator calculations immediately.
  2) Alternatively, you can provide a CSV or share the latest price data, and I’ll compute the indicators and deliver a full, detailed trend report with actionable signals.
- Let me know which path you prefer. If you want me to retry now, I’ll attempt the data fetch and then generate the full report with the 8 indicators listed above.

Proposed report structure (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: Summary of the current trend context for META (long-term, medium-term, and momentum).
- Indicator-by-indicator analysis:
  - close_50_sma: current position relative to price, slope, recent interactions (bounces/crosses).
  - close_200_sma: regime confirmation, golden/death cross status.
  - close_10_ema: recent momentum shifts and proximity to price action.
  - macd and macds: momentum signal, crossovers, histogram trends.
  - rsi: current level, trend-divergence observations, overbought/oversold context.
  - boll: position relative to Boll middle and bands, breakout or reversion signals.
  - atr: current volatility regime, implications for stops and position sizing.
- Integrated view: alignment or divergence among indicators, probability-weighted scenarios (bullish, neutral, bearish) with key triggers.
- Trade guidelines: entry/exit levels, stop placement, and risk management notes tailored to META given the current signal constellation.
- Quick-reference table: a compact checklist of signals and actions.

Markdown table (key points to organize once data is available)
- Indicator
- What it measures
- Interpretation in META context
- Preferred signal/favorable condition
- Trade note and risk consideration

Table (example layout)
| Indicator | What it measures | META interpretation context | Favorable signal | Trade note / Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction | Aligns with price for trend confidence | Price above 50SMA and rising | Use as trend filter; avoid entries when price is below |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms regime (bullish vs bearish) | Price above 200SMA | Consider long-exposure bias; watch for cross near resistance |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; entry timing | Price above 10EMA with cross | Use for pullback entries in uptrends |
| macd | Momentum impulse | Crosses indicate momentum changes | MACD above signal and rising | Confirm with price action; avoid in range markets |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoothing signal; corroboration | MACD crossing above MACD signal | Adds confidence; trim risk if diverging from price |
| rsi | Momentum strength | Overbought/oversold context | RSI rising but not overbought in uptrend | Watch for weakening momentum near highs |
| boll | Volatility and price positioning | Mean-reversion vs breakout tendencies | Price holds above Boll middle with bands expanding | Breakouts possible; use with stop rules |
| atr | Volatility level | Stops and sizing based on volatility | ATR rising with price move | Increase stops or position size cautiously in high vol |

If you’d like, I can attempt the data fetch again now and then deliver the full, detailed report with the 8 indicators and the final table. Please tell me which path you prefer.
