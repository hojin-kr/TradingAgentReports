Thanks for the quick follow-up. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for TSLA (date 2025-10-02), but the tool responded with a FileNotFoundError, indicating an internal issue with the data source right now. I’ll outline how we can move forward and offer options so we can continue delivering value.

Options to proceed
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now
- I can re-run the Reddit-stock-info tool immediately if you’d like me to try again. If the underlying issue persists, I’ll switch to option 2 automatically.

2) Proceed with a best-effort TSLA sentiment/news analysis (no Reddit feed)
- I can deliver a thorough qualitative analysis of TSLA’s sentiment and news outlook for the past week using alternative public sources (press releases, traditional news outlets, regulatory updates, earnings commentary, social media signals beyond Reddit, etc.). I’ll clearly note when data is inferred or not sourced from the failed feed and highlight key themes, catalysts, and risks for traders.

3) Wait for the tool to be restored and then deliver a full, data-backed report
- I’ll monitor and re-run the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available and then compile the long-form report with the sentiment timeline, notable posts, and news synthesis, followed by actionable implications for traders.

What I can deliver right now (without the Reddit data)
- A structured, comprehensive framework for the TSLA report, outlining sentiment and news drivers to watch, with guidance on how to interpret signals for trading decisions.
- A clear list of catalysts and risks to monitor in the coming days/weeks (e.g., product cycle updates, regulatory developments, production guidance, earnings cadence, competition in EV/robotaxi spaces, etc.).
- A Markdown table at the end to organize key points (to be filled with actual data once the data source is back online).

Proposed structure of the TSLA report (to be filled with data once available)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment posture, critical drivers, and near-term catalysts.
- Social sentiment analysis (past 7 days): tone distribution, notable shifts, and major sentiment inflection points.
- News flow synthesis: summarize significant company announcements, press coverage, regulatory updates, and major market-moving events.
- Topic-level deep dives: AI/robotaxi developments, energy/solar sentiment, supply chain, production/price actions, and consumer demand signals.
- Risk/uncertainty assessment: regulatory risks, macro sensitivities, competitive dynamics, and execution risks.
- Trading implications: short-, medium-, and long-term scenarios, and suggested risk controls.
- Data appendix: sources, methodology notes, and any data caveats.

Draft Markdown table (structure only)
| Key Theme | Summary (Past Week) | Notable Posts / Angles | Sentiment Trend | Catalyst / Event | Implications for Traders |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Theme A (e.g., AI/robotaxi) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Theme B (e.g., EV demand/pricing) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Theme C (e.g., regulation) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Theme D (e.g., production) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Next steps
- Let me know which option you want:
  - Retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
  - Proceed with option 2 (best-effort analysis without the Reddit feed), or
  - Wait for the tool to be restored and deliver the full data-backed report.

If you’d like me to proceed with option 2 right away, I’ll deliver a thorough qualitative TSLA sentiment and news analysis for the past week, clearly labeled with any data gaps and assumptions, followed by the structured Markdown table with placeholder labels that we’ll fill once the data source is back.
