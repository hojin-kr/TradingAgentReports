I attempted to retrieve PLTR data and run the requested indicators, but the data-access tool failed with a FileNotFoundError. I don’t have the current price series or computed indicator values to quote precise readings right now. If you’d like, I can retry as soon as the data tool is back online, or proceed with a robust indicator framework you can act on once the data is available.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8 indicators) for PLTR (Palantir) given typical growth-stock characteristics and current market volatility
- Why this set: PLTR often exhibits mid- to high-variance moves with a blend of trend and momentum signals. The chosen indicators give you a balanced view of trend direction (short, medium, and long), momentum strength/divergence, and risk management through volatility.

1) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it provides: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why it’s suitable for PLTR: Helps identify the prevailing trend while smoothing out short-term noise; useful to confirm trend with other signals.

2) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it provides: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major trend context (golden/death cross tendencies).
- Why it’s suitable for PLTR: Gives macro-trend orientation; important for framing entries/exits in a volatile growth name.

3) close_10_ema
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it provides: Short-term momentum/weighting; quick shifts in price.
- Why it’s suitable for PLTR: Captures more immediate price dynamics to complement the slower SMAs; helps with early entry/exit cues when used with longer averages.

4) macd
- Category: MACD Related
- What it provides: Momentum shifts via MACD line vs. signal line; convergence/divergence signals.
- Why it’s suitable for PLTR: Useful for catching trend changes in a stock known for momentum-driven moves; works best when corroborated with other indicators.

5) macds
- Category: MACD Related
- What it provides: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD) smoothing; crossovers with MACD line generate signals.
- Why it’s suitable for PLTR: Adds a smoother confirmation layer to MACD crossovers, reducing false signals in choppy markets.

6) macdh
- Category: MACD Related
- What it provides: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence visualized.
- Why it’s suitable for PLTR: Quickly shows changes in momentum magnitude; helps detect weakening/strengthening trends early.

7) rsi
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- What it provides: Relative momentum and overbought/oversold levels; potential divergences.
- Why it’s suitable for PLTR: Helps gauge whether price moves are overextended or can revert, especially after strong runs. Use with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.

8) atr
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it provides: Average true range; baseline for volatility and risk management (position sizing, stop placement).
- Why it’s suitable for PLTR: PLTR can exhibit outsized moves; ATR supports adaptive risk controls and helps set sensible stops.

Notes on interpretation and integration (once data is available)
- Use the 50/200 SMA to define the broad trend: If price sits above both and 50-SMA is above 200-SMA, lean to trend-following entries; if price is below both, be cautious with long entries.
- Use 10-EMA for timing within the established trend: When price trades above 10-EMA in uptrends (and the MACD line crosses above its signal), it can signal momentum-backed entries; in downtrends, price below 10-EMA can reinforce caution.
- MACD family (macd, macds, macdh) provides a layered momentum view: look for MACD line crossing above MACD signal as a bullish cue; confirm with MACD histogram turning positive and rising. Divergences between price and MACD histogram can warn of potential reversals.
- RSI adds perspective on overbought/oversold conditions: In neutral/trending markets, RSI around mid-range supports ongoing moves; in overbought conditions, wait for confirmation from MACD/price action to avoid premature entries.
- ATR supports risk controls: Use ATR-based stop distances to adapt to current volatility; consider widening stops during higher-volatility bursts and tightening in calmer regimes.

Plan if data retrieval is restored
- I will fetch PLTR price data for a clean window (e.g., last 1–2 years up to today) and compute the eight indicators above.
- I’ll deliver a trend assessment (tilt direction, momentum strength, volatility context) and provide actionable signals (entry/exit ideas with caveats).
- I’ll also attach a concise risk note with suggested stop levels based on ATR and a recommended position-sizing approach.

Markdown table: key points summary
- Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for PLTR | Rationale for PLTR
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Use with long-term trend filters to confirm entries | Balances lag with timely trend signals
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend context | Determine macro trend (uptrend/downtrend) | Essential for strategic positioning
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Watch for quick momentum shifts within the trend | Helps with timely entries/exits
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum vs. trend via MACD line | Bullish signal when MACD crosses above signal; verify with price action | Core momentum reader
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line smoothing | Crossovers with MACD for trade triggers | Reduces false positives
- macdh | MACD Related | MACD histogram magnitude | Increasing histogram supports momentum; watch for divergence | Early momentum signals
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold | Use with trend context; watch for divergences | Complements price and MACD signals
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility (risk/stop levels) | Set stops/position size to ATR-based ranges | Critical for risk management in a volatile stock

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now and then generate a full, numbers-backed report with the eight indicators, including a trend tilt, signal flags, and risk guidance.
- Alternatively, tell me to proceed with a different indicator mix (e.g., include/replace Bollinger bands or VWMA) based on your preferred emphasis (trend vs. volatility vs. volume).
