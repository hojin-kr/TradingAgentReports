I attempted to fetch PLTR data, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can still move forward with a solid, actionable indicator setup and a detailed interpretive framework. If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now or use this framework and fill in specific readings once the data fetch succeeds.

Recommended 8 indicators for PLTR (diverse, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average)
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Look for price staying above the 50 SMA for a bullish tone; a pullback to or slightly below the 50 SMA can offer a potential entry if other momentum signals align.
  - Why it’s suitable: Smooths noise and helps confirm ongoing trend direction in a volatile stock like PLTR.

- close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average)
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark and major dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Price above the 200 SMA and a bullish relation (50 SMA above 200 SMA) supports a constructive, longer-term stance; a death cross or golden cross can signal regime shifts.
  - Why it’s suitable: Provides strategic context beyond short-term moves.

- close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average)
  - What it measures: Quick momentum shift and near-term price dynamics.
  - How to use: Price crossing above/below the 10 EMA can flag short-term entry/exit points, especially when aligned with longer-term trend signals.
  - Why it’s suitable: Offers timely read on momentum in a stock known for rapid swings.

- macd (MACD line)
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; trend changes.
  - How to use: Bullish signals when MACD crosses above its signal line; bearish when it crosses below. Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or choppy markets.
  - Why it’s suitable: Classic momentum confirmation that complements trend indicators.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: Smoother signal of MACD; helps confirm crossovers.
  - How to use: Crossovers of MACD line and MACD Signal provide more robust trade triggers when paired with price action and RSI.
  - Why it’s suitable: Reduces false positives from MACD alone.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: Momentum strength and divergence via gap between MACD and its signal.
  - How to use: Increasing positive histogram supports a strengthening uptrend; shrinking or negative histogram hints at momentum loss; look for divergences with price.
  - Why it’s suitable: Early visualization of momentum changes, useful for timing when other signals are ambiguous.

- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - What it measures: Momentum magnitude and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: Look for RSI moving toward 30–40 on dips (potentially oversold) or 60–70 on rallies (approaching overbought). Divergences with price can warn of reversals.
  - Why it’s suitable: Provides a momentum context and helps gauge impulsive moves; best when used with trend signals.

- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it measures: Market volatility.
  - How to use: Use ATR to set dynamic position sizing and stop-loss levels; rising ATR suggests wider stops and higher risk, while shrinking ATR implies tighter risk control.
  - Why it’s suitable: Important for risk management in a stock with potentially explosive moves like PLTR.

Notes on how to interpret signals in PLTR’s context
- Trend detection: Rely on the 50 SMA and 200 SMA to establish the regime (bullish if price is above both and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA; bearish if the opposite). In a choppy/sideways context, expect more whipsaws on short-term indicators like MACD and RSI.
- Momentum confirmation: Use MACD (macd with macds and macdh) together with RSI to distinguish true momentum shifts from short-term noise. E.g., a MACD bullish crossover accompanied by rising histogram and RSI moving off oversold levels strengthens a potential entry.
- Volatility and risk management: Use ATR to calibrate stop losses and position sizing. If ATR spikes, consider widening stops or reducing risk; if ATR contracts, look for tighter stops and possibly smaller positions.
- Volume/price interplay: While VWMA isn’t in the current 8 indicators list, you can optionally monitor it to confirm price moves with volume. If price advances on increasing volume, the move is more credible; if volume diverges, be cautious.

Trade/trend framework (decision aids)
- Long setup candidate: Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA with 50 SMA above 200 SMA; MACD bullish crossover, MACD histogram rising, RSI climbing from mid-range, ATR not expanding dramatically.
- Short setup candidate: Price below 50 SMA and 200 SMA with 50 SMA below 200 SMA; MACD bearish crossover, RSI turning down from overbought levels, MACD histogram negative, ATR rising (risk management considerations).
- Neutral/transition: Conflicting signals across MACD, RSI, and price relative to moving averages; tighten risk management and wait for clearer confirmation.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching PLTR data now to generate an actual, data-driven readout (trends, support/resistance levels, and indicator values). Please let me know if you’d like me to attempt another data pull immediately or proceed with this framework and fill in readings once data is available.
- If you want, I can also run the stockstats indicators report for PLTR (using the same 8 indicators) once data access is restored, and then provide a more precise, data-backed narrative with a table of signals.

Markdown table: Key indicators, role, and what to look for
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Category: Moving Averages | Role: Trend direction and dynamic support | What to look for: Price above 50 SMA with a bullish slope; pullbacks to the 50 SMA offering potential entries if other signals align.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Category: Moving Averages | Role: Long-term trend benchmark | What to look for: Price above 200 SMA and 50 SMA above 200 SMA for bullish regime; golden cross signals long-term uptrend.
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Category: Moving Averages | Role: Short-term momentum | What to look for: Price crossing above/below 10 EMA; corroborate with longer-term trend for timely entries.
- Indicator: macd | Category: MACD Related | Role: Momentum and trend change signals | What to look for: MACD line crossing above/below MACD Signal; rising/falling magnitude with histogram as confirmation.
- Indicator: macds | Category: MACD Related | Role: Smoothing and confirmation | What to look for: MACD vs MACD Signal cross strength; align with price action for robust entries/exits.
- Indicator: macdh | Category: MACD Related | Role: Momentum strength | What to look for: Histogram expanding positive values (bullish momentum) or expanding negative values (bearish momentum); watch for divergences with price.
- Indicator: rsi | Category: Momentum Indicators | Role: Momentum magnitude and overbought/oversold cues | What to look for: RSI moving toward 30–40 from oversold or 60–70 from overbought; divergences with price add warning signals.
- Indicator: atr | Category: Volatility Indicators | Role: Volatility and risk management | What to look for: Rising ATR signals higher stop risk; adjust position sizes; use for stop placement and stop distances.

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retrial of the data fetch now and then deliver a detailed, data-backed trend report for PLTR, including exact indicator readings and a filled-in table. Just say “retry data fetch” and I’ll run it as soon as the tool is available.
