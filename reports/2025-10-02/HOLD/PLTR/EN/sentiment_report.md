I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock news for PLTR on 2025-10-02, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t proceed with that data source right now.

Options moving forward:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch (I can attempt again in a moment).
- Proceed with a comprehensive analysis using alternative sources (e.g., other social platforms, recent company news, sentiment summaries from public sources) and clearly note that Reddit data is unavailable for this pass.
- If you have specific sources or a preferred time window to include, share them and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.

If you’d like me to proceed now without Reddit data, here’s what I’ll deliver in a complete report (and I’ll append a Markdown table at the end for key takeaways):
- Summary of sentiment: daily tone (positive/negative/neutral) across the last week from available sources, with any notable sentiment shifts (e.g., reactions to earnings hints, product announcements, or regulatory news).
- News overview: digest of notable PLTR news in the past week (product updates, partnerships, government contracts, regulatory issues, leadership moves) and potential implications for short-term trading.
- Social chatter themes: top topics driving discussion (e.g., data/AI capabilities, competitive position, valuation concerns, risk factors) and any recurring bullish/bearish arguments.
- Price/volume context: any known near-term price action or volume spikes correlated with news or sentiment surges.
- Sentiment-to-price implications: short-form insights on how current sentiment and news might translate into near-term moves, including potential catalysts and risk factors.
- Trader takeaways: actionable ideas (e.g., scenarios where PLTR could outperform or underperform, suggested hedges or entry/exit considerations) with caveats.
- Risk factors: what could invalidate the read (data lags, sentiment misreads, macro shocks, regulatory changes).
- Visual/structured summary: a concise bullet list of the most impactful signals and a Markdown table (as requested) organizing key points.

If you prefer, I can also draft the full report now with placeholders where Reddit-specific insights would go, and fill them in once the Reddit data is available.

Please tell me which path you want:
1) Retry Reddit data fetch now
2) Proceed with non-Reddit sources only
3) Provide any preferred sources/time window and I’ll align the report accordingly
