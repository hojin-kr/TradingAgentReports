Recommendation: HOLD PLTR.

Rationale
- Near-term uncertainties remain material: government-cycle timing, slower non-government commercial ramp, and near-term profitability timing keep the risk-reward skewed to caution.
- Data gaps limit precise timing and risk controls. Until concrete bookings, renewals, ARR mix shifts, and margin progress show up, adding exposure could be mistimed.
- Long-run bull case (Foundry/Gotham moat, AI governance, international expansion) remains plausible, but milestones are not guaranteed in the near term.

Key considerations supporting Hold
- Bear risk: government procurement timing, slower commercial ramp, potential margin pressure from R&D/S&M spend, and elevated valuation could compress if growth slows.
- Bull signal: platform moat and cross-sell potential could drive healthier ARR mix and margin leverage over time, especially with AI-enabled deployments.

Near-term catalysts to monitor
- Bookings cadence and renewal velocity: stabilization or acceleration in recurring revenue share.
- Cross-sell/upsell momentum outside government: meaningful ARR per account gains in non-government sectors.
- International traction: pilots or multi-year deals in Europe/UK reducing US government concentration.
- AI-driven deployments: measurable ROI from governance-focused AI features and deployments.
- Margin trajectory: sustained gross-margin improvement and evidence of operating leverage.

Risk management framework
- Position sizing: keep exposure modest until data-backed signals confirm a favorable setup.
- Stops/hedges: use ATR-based stops; consider risk-defined options hedges around earnings or major contract milestones.
- Scenario triggers:
  - Base/Hold: data inconclusive; no clear trend change.
  - Bull upgrade: clear non-government ARR growth, better renewals, and improving margins with constructive data readings.
  - Bear trigger: bookings/renewals weaken, cross-sell stalls, or margin deterioration; be prepared to prune or hedge.

Upgrade/downgrade plan
- Upgrade to BUY if, within the next couple of quarters, we see: sustained non-government ARR growth, stronger renewal metrics, and a clear margin uptrend supported by data readings.
- Downgrade to SELL if: non-government growth stalls, renewals deteriorate, or gross margins fail to improve alongside negative data signals.

Next steps
- Data action: perform the urgent data fetch to produce quantitative readings (indicator suite and momentum context) to anchor timing.
- Reassessment cadence: align to next earnings release or major contract milestone with explicit criteria for moving to Buy or Sell.

Bottom line
- While the long-term thesis for PLTR is intact, the prudent stance today is to hold and await concrete, data-backed progress across bookings, non-government penetration, and margin leverage before adding exposure.
