Reasoned recommendation: HOLD

Summary
- The plan you shared already nails the current posture: the bullish AI/tech tailwinds exist, but concentration risk, macro sensitivity, and potential AI monetization uncertainties justify a cautious, risk-controlled stance rather than a bold Buy.

What I’m advising now
- Keep QQQ exposure at a modest level and maintain disciplined risk controls. Do not chase strength here; wait for clear, data-backed improvements to earnings visibility and macro stability before upgrading to Buy.
- Maintain hedges or hedging-ready structures to limit downside in the event of a macro shock or megacap disappointment.
- If you’re not currently exposed, prefer a staged, pullback-driven entry rather than buying at current highs.

Key practical steps (today)
- Position sizing: cap QQQ exposure at roughly 2–3% of the equity sleeve (or the equivalent risk budget in your model). Consider tranche entries on confirmed pullbacks rather than a single lump-sum add.
- Risk controls:
  - ATR-based stops on QQQ with trailing stops as the position moves in your favor.
  - Use VWMA confirmations (20- or 50-day) to validate new entries or to hold existing exposure; break of VWMA on high volume signals reassessment.
  - Consider cost-efficient downside protection (protective puts or a collar) to preserve upside while limiting downside risk.
- Monitoring triggers (upgrade/downgrade):
  - Upgrade to Buy if, over a rolling 6–8 week window, you see:
    - Clear AI-driven monetization translating into durable revenue growth and margin expansion across mega-caps.
    - Macro data showing sustained inflation cooling and favorable rate expectations.
    - Mega-cap earnings guidance that meets/exceeds expectations with credible, achievable guidance.
    - Technically, QQQ sustains a breakout above a defined resistance with healthy volume and positive momentum.
  - Downgrade toward Sell if you observe:
    - Deterioration in mega-cap earnings guidance or AI monetization milestones stalling.
    - Macro shock (unexpected inflation uptick, stronger dollar, regulatory/regime shifts) causing rapid multiple compression.
    - Technical leadership faltering (momentum waning, rising ATR/divergences, weak follow-through on rallies).

Operational considerations
- If already long: tighten incremental stops, trim on strength, and keep hedges in place or ready to deploy.
- If not exposed: implement a staged entry plan tied to trend and volume signals; avoid loading up at current highs.
- Diversification: ensure other positions help dampen QQQ-specific concentration risk (broad market exposure, value tilts, or non-tech hedges).
- Review cadence: weekly risk checks on macro indicators and mega-cap guidance; monthly reassessment with clear upgrade/downgrade criteria and a time-bound log of triggers.

Bottom line
- The current data support a cautious Hold with hedges and clear, disciplined triggers for upgrading or downgrading. The upside requires durableAi-driven monetization and favorable macro conditions; the downside is real if mega-cap earnings falter or macro shocks hit.

If you want, I can tailor exact threshold numbers (price levels, moving-average crossovers, RSI/MACD readings, ATR bands) to fit your capital, risk tolerance, and time horizon, and draft a ready-to-use script for decision discussions.
