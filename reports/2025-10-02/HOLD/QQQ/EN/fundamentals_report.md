Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the data across all requested tools, but I’m hitting a tool-side error right now.

What happened
- Parallel tool run returned FileNotFoundError for all five data requests (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement).
- An individual attempt to fetch insider sentiment for QQQ also failed with the same FileNotFoundError.

Notes on scope
- QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index. Insider sentiment/transactions data are typically published for individual companies, not for ETFs. Even if the tool returns data for the ETF ticker, it may be empty or not meaningful because there aren’t “insiders” in the ETF in the same way as a single company.
- The SimFin data feeds (balance sheet, cash flow, income statement) are designed for individual companies. An ETF’s fundamental statements won’t be meaningful in the same way, though we can analyze the ETF’s structural metrics (AUM, expense ratio, holdings, turnover, tracking error) rather than a corporate income statement.

What I can do next (your call)
Option A — Retry data fetch now
- I’ll retry the same data fetches as soon as the tool service is available again and report back with the results.

Option B — Switch to ETF-focused fundamentals (recommended for QQQ)
- I’ll build a comprehensive ETF-focused fundamental analysis of QQQ, including:
  - Fund profile: issuer, inception date, objective, replication method.
  - Key metrics: assets under management (AUM), expense ratio, distribution yield, turnover, tracking error.
  - Holdings snapshot: top holdings (likely the largest tech names), sector allocation, and concentration risk.
  - Liquidity and trading metrics: average daily volume, bid-ask spread considerations, liquidity profile.
  - Historical context: performance vs. benchmark, typical correlations with tech/digital economy cycles, and notable periods of tracking error.
  - Practical trader insights: how macro tech cycles, interest rate regime, and market risk sentiment might impact QQQ.
  - Limitations: what can and cannot be inferred from ETF-level data versus underlying components.
- Note: I’ll clearly label where the data is derived from and indicate if some numbers are trailing/approximate.

Option C — Analyze underlying constituents (deep dive)
- If you’d prefer, I can pull data on the top holdings (e.g., MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, etc.) and provide:
  - Individual company fundamentals (as available), insider sentiment/transactions (if applicable to those firms), and how those pieces feed into the ETF’s overall exposure.
  - A synthesized view of how the fundamental picture of the top holdings affects QQQ’s risk/return profile.

Please tell me which option you’d like. If you choose Option B (ETF-focused fundamentals), I’ll proceed as soon as tool access resumes and deliver a thorough report with the requested Markdown table at the end. In the meantime, here’s a recommended Markdown table skeleton I’ll fill in later:

- Proposed final table (to be appended at end of the report)
  - Item | Detail / Key Figures | Source / Notes
  - Fund profile | Invesco QQQ Trust, Nasdaq-100 tracking, inception date, replication method | issuer materials
  - AUM / AUM trend | [current AUM], recent change, liquidity profile | fund facts
  - Expense ratio | [expense ratio], comparison to peers | fund facts
  - Yield / distributions | [SEC yield or distribution yield], payout history | fund facts
  - Top holdings (illustrative) | Top 5 holdings and their weights | fund holdings
  - Sector allocation | Weight by sector, concentration risk | fund holdings
  - Tracking error / performance vs. benchmark | 1-, 3-, 5-year tracking error, NAV vs. index | fund performance
  - Liquidity metrics | Avg daily volume, bid-ask spread, liquidity bands | market data
  - Risk considerations | Key risks (tech tilt, concentration, macro risk) | analysis
  - Insider data note | Not typically applicable at ETF level; if underlying company data used, note sources | caveats

If you prefer, you can also specify a date range or target underlying tickers (e.g., top 10 holdings) for a more granular view.
