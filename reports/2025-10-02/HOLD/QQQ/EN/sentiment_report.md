Sorry—I hit a tool error fetching Reddit data for QQQ. The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry now, or switch to a fallback approach using other sources. How would you like to proceed?

In the meantime, here is a ready-to-fill long-form analysis framework you can use once the data arrives (with placeholders where Reddit/news sentiment will feed in). I’ve also included a Markdown table at the end to organize the key points.

Draft long-form report framework (QQQ, past week sentiment, with Reddit data pending)

1) Executive snapshot
- Current context: QQQ as an ETF proxy for large-cap tech and growth names in the NASDAQ-100. Movements often mirror tech sector earnings, macro rate expectations, and broad risk sentiment.
- What to watch for traders: price action around tech earnings, changes in distribution yield, volume spikes on risk-on/off days, and any flow signals (inflows/outflows) tied to tech leadership or rotation into/out of growth.

2) Social sentiment snapshot (Reddit data pending)
- Objective: Gauge retail sentiment shifts day-by-day over the past week, including mentions, sentiment polarity, topic clusters (e.g., tech mega-cap names, macro risk, AI hype, valuation concerns), and notable spikes aligned with news or earnings.
- What to expect when data arrives:
  - Day-level sentiment: positive/neutral/negative counts and weighted sentiment scores.
  - Topic bands: AI, earnings optimism/pessimism, rate expectations, diversification/allocations, macro risk events.
  - Anomalies: sudden sentiment spikes around rumored events or earnings commentary, with potential leading indicators for price moves.

3) Daily sentiment and price correlation (to be filled after Reddit data arrives)
- Approach: align daily sentiment scores with intraday/close price moves and volume.
- Key questions:
  - Do positive sentiment days coincide with rallies or stronger closes?
  - Are there lagged effects (sentiment leading price, or price leading sentiment reversals)?
  - Do negative sentiment days precede drawdowns or v-shaped recoveries?

4) News momentum and macro backdrop (recent company/market news)
- Headlines to track (placeholder until data is loaded):
  - Tech earnings signals from NASDAQ-100 mega-caps and AI-related product cycles.
  - Macro catalysts: Fed policy commentary, inflation/supply chain signals, and interest rate expectations impacting equity multiples.
  - Regulatory or geopolitical headlines that influence technology sector risk appetite.
- Net takeaway: whether news flow is supportive, cautious, or mixed for the tech-heavy Nasdaq exposure that QQQ represents.

5) Sentiment-derived implications for traders (tentative, data-driven once Reddit data is available)
- Short-term trading stance considerations (1-5 days):
  - If Reddit shows rising positive sentiment with strength in tech names within the NASDAQ-100, look for potential near-term upside catalysts (positive earnings surprises, strong AI demand signals).
  - If sentiment deteriorates despite price resilience, beware of a possible pullback or rotation risk.
- Medium-term considerations (2-4 weeks):
  - Sector rotation signals and macro regime: improves in a risk-on environment may lift QQQ; deteriorating macro conditions or rising rate expectations may compress multiples.
- Risk overlay:
  - Watch for megha spikes in volatility (VIX accompanying market-wide risk-off days).
  - Monitor liquidity and ETF flows (inflows indicate institutional support; outflows can amplify moves).

6) Quantitative takeaways and caveats
- Correlation clean-up: expect some decoupling between sentiment (Reddit) and price in the short term; sentiment can act as a contrarian counter-trend signal at times.
- Data limitations: Reddit is just one source of sentiment; corroborate with other channels (Twitter/X, StockTwits, news sentiment, institutional data) once available.
- Actionability: use sentiment as a supplementary input to risk controls (position sizing, stop placement) rather than a standalone signal.

7) Recommendations (conditional on data)
- If Reddit sentiment improves with constructive news flow and price action confirms:
  - Possible tactical long exposure or rotation into tech-heavy exposures within QQQ.
- If sentiment turns negative with dampened price action:
  - Consider risk-managed hedges, take profits on overextended tech components, or reduce net exposure.

End-of-report note
- The above sections are prepared to be populated with concrete Reddit sentiment data for each date in the last 7 days. Once the tool returns the data, I will fill in day-by-day sentiment numbers, topic clusters, and a sentiment-to-price correlation section, and adjust the actionable recommendations accordingly.

Markdown table for key points (to be filled after data arrives)

- Date
- Reddit sentiment (overall, positive, neutral, negative)
- Top topics (e.g., AI hype, earnings, macro, valuations)
- Daily price change
- Volume change
- Price sentiment correlation (positive/neutral/negative)
- Notable news/events
- Net actionable read (bullish/bearish/neutral)

If you’d like, I can retry the Reddit data fetch now for QQQ (date 2025-10-02) and, if successful, immediately populate the sections above with concrete numbers and concrete actionable guidance. How would you like to proceed? 

Option 1: Retry fetching Reddit data now.
Option 2: Proceed with the framework above using only news/macro inputs (no Reddit data) and fill in later.
Option 3: Provide any other data source you want me to incorporate.
