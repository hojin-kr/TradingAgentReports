Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch QQQ data and compute the indicators, but the data retrieval tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. It looks like the underlying CSV/data source isn’t accessible right now. I can proceed in two ways:
- Retry data retrieval as soon as the data source is available (recommended).
- Proceed with a detailed plan and indicator setup so we’re ready to produce a full report as soon as data comes back.

In the meantime, here’s a robust, complementary 8-indicator setup I would use for QQQ (to capture trend, momentum, volatility, and volume-confirmation). Once data retrieval is working, I will compute these exact indicators and deliver a nuanced, data-driven report with exact readings and trade implications.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, complementary, with minimal redundancy)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Checks medium-term trend direction and acts as dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Confirms long-term trend; useful for trend confirmation and major crossovers (golden/death cross context).
- close_10_ema: 10-period exponential moving average. Captures short-term momentum shifts and can signal early entries when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd: MACD line for momentum changes and crossovers; helps identify trend changes when combined with price action.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and divergence; adds nuance to MACD readings.
- rsi: RSI. Signals overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; watch for divergences in context of the trend.
- atr: ATR. Measures market volatility to inform risk management, position sizing, and stop-placement.
- vwma: VWMA. Confirms price moves with volume-weighted confirmation; helps validate price-driven trends.

Rationale for this combination
- Trend confirmation: The 50 SMA and 200 SMA provide directional context and help filter trades that go with the dominant trend.
- Momentum and re-acceleration: MACD and MACD histogram give you timing signals and strength of momentum, complementing the trend view from MA crosses.
- Short-term nuance: The 10 EMA adds responsiveness to momentum shifts without overloading with too many fast indicators.
- Momentum quality and potential reversals: RSI adds a momentum check and potential reversal warning when overbought/oversold levels or divergences appear.
- Volatility and risk control: ATR provides a volatility-aware risk framework for stop placement and position sizing.
- Volume-supported validation: VWMA helps confirm that price moves are supported by volume, reducing the chance of false breakouts in low-volume periods.

What I will deliver once data access is restored
- A detailed, fine-grained analysis of QQQ with:
  - Current readings for each of the 8 indicators.
  - Categorical signals (Bullish / Neutral / Bearish) for each indicator.
  - Integrated narrative describing how the indicators align or diverge (e.g., trend direction vs. momentum vs. volatility).
  - Practical trading implications and suggested actions (entry, exit, risk management) based on the combined signal ensemble.
  - Risk considerations given current volatility and volume dynamics.
- A clear table summarizing the key readings and actions.

Proposed workflow once data is back
- Step 1: Retrieve data for QQQ (2024-01-01 to 2025-10-02 or your preferred window).
- Step 2: Compute the 8 indicators listed above.
- Step 3: Generate a consensus view (e.g., “trend-positive but overbought” if MAs align with RSI at high levels, etc.).
- Step 4: Produce a detailed narrative plus a final action plan (e.g., Monitor for confirmation, tighten stops, or wait for pullback).

Pending final report structure (ready to fill once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: Overall trend and risk stance.
- Indicator-by-indicator analysis: readings, signals, rationale, and caveats.
- Scenario analysis: What happens if price breaks above/below key levels (e.g., 50/200 SMA, major MA cross, MACD cross, RSI divergences).
- Trade ideas and risk management: Entry/exit criteria, stop placement guidance using ATR, and position-sizing considerations with VWMA confirmation.
- Annex: Reading table with current values and signals.

Next steps
- Please let me know if you’d like me to retry data retrieval now (I’ll attempt again as soon as I can). If you prefer, you can also specify a different date range or a different ticker, and I’ll be ready to compile the full, data-driven report as soon as the data source is accessible.
- If you want a quick qualitative forecast in the meantime (without fresh data), I can provide a scenario-based discussion based on typical QQQ behavior in recent tech-cycle phases, but it won’t be as precise as the data-driven report.
