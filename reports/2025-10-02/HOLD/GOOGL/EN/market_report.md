I attempted to fetch GO OGL data using the Yahoo Finance tool (get_YFin_data), but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like a backend issue with the data fetch. I can retry shortly or proceed with a solid, data-agnostic framework you can rely on once the data comes through. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a focused, non-redundant set of indicators and an approach tailored to GO OGL (Alphabet) given its typical growth/tech-advertising context.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale
- close_50_sma
  Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to see if GO OGL is trading above or below a key trend line and to filter entries when price interacts with this level.
- close_200_sma
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm the overarching market regime (bullish vs bearish) and supports strategic decisions like position bias (trend-following vs mean-reversion).
- close_10_ema
  Why: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts in price action to flag potential entries or exits when aligned with longer-term trend.
- macd
  Why: Core momentum/trend-change signal. Crossovers, histogram behavior, and divergence provide context on whether momentum is accelerating or fading.
- macds
  Why: MACD signal line adds a smoothing filter for triggering trades. Crossovers with macd are commonly used entry/exit cues when other signals agree.
- macdh
  Why: Momentum strength and divergence visualization. Helps identify waning momentum even if MACD lines look favorable, reducing false signals in choppy markets.
- rsi
  Why: Momentum with overbought/oversold context. Good for spotting potential reversals or continuations when used with trend direction.
- boll_ub
  Why: Upper Bollinger Band signals potential overbought conditions and near-term breakout zones. Useful when momentum indicators align with price touching or crossing the upper band.

How to interpret these signals for GO OGL (once data is available)
- Trend framework
  - If price is above the 50-SMA and 200-SMA with a bullish cross (50-SMA above 200-SMA) and the 10-EMA trending higher, think bullish posture; look for pullbacks to the 50-SMA as potential entries only if MACD and RSI support upside.
  - If price is below the 200-SMA or the 50-SMA is crossing below the 200-SMA, be cautious on long entries; prefer higher-confirmation setups (MACD turning positive with RSI not in extreme overbought territory).
- Momentum filtering
  - MACD: positive cross or MACD above zero supports upside tempo; negative cross or MACD below zero supports downside tempo.
  - MACDS (signal): cross above MACD line adds confirmatory strength to long signals; cross below adds strength to short signals.
  - MACDH: rising histogram supports ongoing momentum; shrinking/negative histogram warns of fading momentum despite other signals.
  - RSI: readings above 70 suggest overbought risk (watch for divergences or failure to push price higher); readings below 30 suggest oversold risk (watch for reversals unless downtrend remains strong).
- Volatility/entry zones
  - boll_ub: approach or touch of the upper band can indicate overbought conditions or a breakout zone; use in combination with MACD/RSI to avoid chasing premature breakouts.
  - If price rides the upper band with strong MACD momentum and RSI not overbought, it could imply a durable up move; if RSI is overbought and MACD weakens, be cautious about continued upside.
- Risk management
  - Use ATR-based sizing and stop placement to account for current volatility; higher ATR suggests wider stops, lower ATR allows tighter risk controls.
  - In GAAP-high-volatility periods (e.g., earnings or AI-driven news), favor signals that align across multiple indicators (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA, MACD positive, RSI not overbought, and price near but not beyond boll_ub).

Next steps
- I will retry fetching GO OGL data as soon as I can access the data source. If you’d like, I can attempt the fetch again now, or proceed with a guardrail-based plan (e.g., monitor for a few days and alert on multi-indicator convergence).
- If you prefer, I can also run a parallel quick-check for a couple of indicators (e.g., RSI and MACD overlap) to get a more immediate sense of current momentum once the data is retrieved.

Markdown table: Key points to monitor (once data is available)

- Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for GO OGL
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend with dynamic support/resistance | Price above suggests trend bullish; pullbacks to 50-SMA are potential entries if MACD/Rsi align
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend direction | Cross above 200-SMA indicates bullish regime; cross below may imply macro downside risk
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; use for early entry/exit timing when aligned with longer trend
- macd | Momentum/trend-change via EMA differences | Positive cross and rising MACD support upside; negative cross supports downside
- macds | MACD signal line (smoothed trigger) | Crosses with MACD provide trading signals with added confirmation
- macdh | MACD histogram (momentum strength) | Rising histogram = strengthening momentum; shrinking/negative = weakening momentum
- rsi | Momentum with overbought/oversold context | >70 indicates overbought risk; <30 indicates oversold risk; use divergence with trend for reversals
- boll_ub | Bollinger Upper Band level | Upper-band touch/creak signals potential overbought breakout zones; confirm with MACD/Rsi

Note: I’ll proceed with data retrieval and fill in actionable insights as soon as the data fetch succeeds. If you want me to retry the data fetch now, I can issue another call to get_YFin_data for GOOGL with the same date window.
