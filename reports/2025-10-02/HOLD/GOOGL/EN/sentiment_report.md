I’m running into an internal tool error fetching Reddit data for GOOGL on 2025-10-02 (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). It seems the Reddit data source is unavailable in this environment right now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again momentarily if you’d like.
- Switch sources: I can proceed with a comprehensive long-form report using available news, public sentiment signals, and general social-media chatter (excluding Reddit-specific data) for the past week.
- Outline first: I can draft the full report structure and a Markdown table skeleton now, then fill in details as soon as the Reddit tool becomes available.

If you’d like me to proceed now, I can start with a thorough framework focusing on GOOGL (Alphabet) over the past week, covering:
- Social sentiment overview: daily sentiment trend, notable spikes, and possible driver events (e.g., product announcements, regulatory news, earnings hints).
- Key channels beyond Reddit: Twitter/X, financial news outlets, forums, YouTube commentary, and influential analyst/commentator chatter.
- News signal synthesis: major headlines, earnings-related or regulatory developments, competitive dynamics (AI, Cloud, ads), and any material corporate actions.
- Potential market implications: how sentiment and news might influence short-term moves in GOOGL, risk factors, and scenarios.
- Trade considerations: sentiment-driven setups, volatility context, and what catalysts to watch for next.

I can also provide a MakrMarkdown table at the end summing up:
- Daily sentiment
- Key headlines
- Sentiment drivers
- Estimated impact on price/volatility
- Trade implications and considerations

Which path would you prefer? Retry Reddit data now, or proceed with the broader-source analysis (and I’ll include the Markdown table as requested)?
