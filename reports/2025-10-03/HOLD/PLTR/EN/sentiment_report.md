Sorry — the Reddit/stock-info data fetch tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError) when I tried to retrieve PLTR data for 2025-10-03. I can’t pull the latest Reddit sentiment and related social/news signals right now.

You have a few options:
- Option A: I retry the data fetch now if you’d like me to give it another shot and then deliver the full long-form analysis with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: I proceed with a manual, best-effort long report based on publicly available information and general sentiment patterns up to today (without the live Reddit feed). I’ll clearly note where data is missing or assumed.
- Option C: You provide alternative data sources (e.g., another feed or set of links) and I’ll synthesize from those.

If you want me to proceed immediately with Option B (manual analysis), here is the plan I’ll follow and the kind of insights you’ll get:

What I’ll cover
- Snapshot: Short current-state read on Palantir (PLTR) with recent catalysts and risks.
- Social sentiment lens (qualitative, with caveats): What themes have dominated discussion in the last week (AI capabilities, government contracts, data privacy, competitive positioning, leadership commentary).
- News flow and catalysts: Any notable company announcements, earnings timing, partnerships, product updates, regulatory or policy developments that could move the stock.
- Day-by-day sentiment rough sketch: I’ll outline probable sentiment arcs for the last 7 days (positive, negative, neutral) and key event drivers if known, plus notable spikes in chatter.
- Trading implications: What the sentiment and news signals could imply for
  - Short-term moves (intraday/1–2 week window)
  - Medium-term thesis (1–3 months)
  - Risk factors to monitor (contracts, government exposure, AI regulatory environment, competitive landscape)
- Key takeaways and watchpoints: Where sentiment and fundamentals align or diverge, and what would trigger a re-rating (e.g., new contract wins, updated product capabilities, earnings surprise).
- Quick-glance table (Markdown) at the end to summarize what matters most.

What the final report will include (structure)
- Executive snapshot
- Social sentiment synthesis (week in focus)
- News catalysts and risk factors
- Scenario-based implications (bullish, neutral, bearish)
- Trader’s checklist and risk controls
- Makrdown table of key points (as requested)

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll attempt another data pull for PLTR on 2025-10-03 and then deliver the full report with the Markdown table at the end. Which option would you prefer?
