PLTR data request issue:
- I attempted to fetch Yahoo Finance data for PLTR (2024-01-01 to 2025-10-03) and also requested indicator reports, but the data retrieval layer is returning a FileNotFoundError. I can’t generate the full indicator analysis without the price data. I can retry the data fetch now, or you can provide a different date range. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) that will give you complementary insights once the data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators) for PLTR
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming trend direction when paired with faster momentum signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming overarching market regime (bullish/bearish) and for golden/death cross context with the 50-sma.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures quick momentum shifts and potential early entry/exit signals. Best used with longer-term averages to filter noise.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum indicator that highlights trend changes via EMA differences and can signal bullish/bearish momentum shifts.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line provide potential trade signals when combined with price action.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and divergence opportunities; useful for spotting shifts ahead of MACD crossovers.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; watch for divergences and cross-check with trend signals.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility; informs risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and helps interpret signal robustness in volatile periods.

Why these are suitable for PLTR’s context
- PLTR often experiences volatile moves with multi-faceted drivers (growth prospects, demand-cycle shifts, and macro risk). The combination above provides:
  - Trend context (50/200 sma) plus a responsive momentum lens (10 ema, MACD family, RSI).
  - Momentum strength and potential reversals (macd, macds, macdh, rsi).
  - Volatility awareness for risk management (atr).
- This mix avoids redundancy (e.g., not overloading with multiple oscillators) while delivering a well-rounded view: trend direction, momentum changes, and risk controls.

What to expect once data is available
- A cohesive report that integrates price structure with the selected indicators.
- Signals to watch for example:
  - Price trading above/below 50/200 sma for trend stance, with 50 crossing above/below 200 as a longer-term signal.
  - MACD crossovers indicating momentum shifts, with MACD histogram confirming strength or weakening.
  - RSI movement relative to 50, 70, and 30 levels to gauge momentum and potential reversals.
  - ATR-based context for stop placement and position sizing in current volatility regime.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now. If you prefer, specify:
  - Any preferred date range (e.g., last 12–24 months, or a recent quarter).
  - Whether you want weekly or daily data granularity (default is daily for these indicators).
- Once data is retrieved, I will generate the eight-indicator report and provide a detailed, nuanced trend analysis with actionable takeaways.
