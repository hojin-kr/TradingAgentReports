I attempted to pull the latest insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the newest quarterly financial statements for PLTR, but the data layer returned a FileNotFoundError across all requested feeds. I can proceed with a best-effort analysis using general fundamentals and provide a clear plan to re-run the data pulls as soon as the backend issue is resolved. Below is a comprehensive PLTR fundamentals-focused report, plus a placeholder table to organize key points once the data comes back.

Executive summary
- Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a data analytics and software unicorn focused on large-scale data integration (Foundry) and mission-critical operating systems (Gotham). The company serves government agencies and commercial customers, with a preference for multi-year contracts and expanding commercial footprint.
- The current week’s insider sentiment and insider transaction data could provide near-term directional signals on management conviction, but those data points are not available right now due to tool errors.
- Core financial picture (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) could reveal the company’s trajectory on profitability, liquidity, and cash generation, which are critical for evaluating growth vs. profitability tradeoffs in a high-SaaS/enterprise software model.

What PLTR is and how it earns
- Business model: PLTR sells software platforms (Foundry for enterprise data integration and Gotham for government/defense) with a mix of subscription revenue and professional services.
- Customer base: A mix of government contracts (notably U.S. and allied government agencies) and enterprise customers in diverse sectors (manufacturing, energy, healthcare, finance). Government exposure provides stable, long-duration contracts; commercial exposure drives top-line growth and net-new business velocity.
- Growth dynamic: Historically, PLTR has pursued large, multi-year contracts with significant expansion opportunities within existing accounts (land-and-expand), while also trying to scale commercial adoption of Foundry to balance government-dominated revenue.

Key fundamentals to watch (data pending)
- Revenue growth: Look for a path to durable top-line expansion, with gross margins improving as the mix shifts toward higher-margin software and away from high-services intensity.
- Profitability: Monitor operating margin and net income. Palantir’s path to GAAP profitability has evolved over time; the main drivers are revenue scale, mix shift to software, and operating expense management (R&D vs. SG&A).
- Cash flow: Free cash flow (FCF) trajectory is crucial for evaluating the company’s ability to self-fund growth, especially given customer lifecycle investments and potential working capital fluctuations.
- Balance sheet liquidity: Cash, equivalents, and any short/long-term debt position; working capital dynamics; and any debt repayment obligations or refinancing risk.
- Cash burn vs. cash generation: As a growth software company, PLTR is scrutinized on whether operating cash flow offers a clear path to sustain growth without excessive external funding.

Insider sentiment and insider transactions (pending data)
- Insider sentiment (buy/sell mood) and insider transactions provide a micro-signal about management confidence and ownership stakes. With the data currently unavailable, I can’t quote the latest 15-day sentiment or insider trading activity. Once the feeds return, I will summarize:
  - Are insiders net buyers or net sellers?
  - Are buys concentrated around key executives or board members?
  - Do the transactions align with existing equity compensation and liquidity needs?
- Traders often view sustained insider buying as a positive signal and insider selling with declines in stock price or risk considerations as cautionary signals. It’s important to contextualize any signal against overall company performance and macro conditions.

Balance sheet snapshot (pending data)
- Liquidity: Cash and equivalents vs. short-term liabilities; current ratio; any material debt maturities in the near term.
- Leverage: Total debt levels, interest coverage, and any off-balance-sheet commitments.
- Working capital: Accounts receivable/payable dynamics, especially given enterprise sales cycles and government contracting timelines.

Income statement snapshot (pending data)
- Revenue: Composition by segment (government vs. commercial) and by contract type (subscription vs. services).
- Margins: Gross margin, operating margin, and any trend in R&D intensity as a percent of revenue.
- Non-operating items: Any unusual or non-recurring gains/losses that affect bottom-line profitability.
- Tax rate: Effective tax rate and any jurisdictional effects on profitability.

Cash flow snapshot (pending data)
- Operating cash flow: Core driver of sustainability for growth investments.
- Investing cash flow: Capex intensity and any capitalized software development or strategic investments.
- Financing cash flow: Any debt issuance/repayment, equity raises, or share repurchases.

Catalysts and risks (contextual, not data-dependent)
- Catalysts:
  - Accelerating adoption of Foundry in enterprise verticals, cross-sell into existing customers, and renewal rate improvements.
  - Government contract wins or extensions, especially for mission-critical data platforms.
  - AI and data analytics demand tailwinds, with customers seeking scalable, secure data platforms.
- Risks:
  - Customer concentration in government work and large enterprise accounts, which can lead to revenue volatility.
  - Competitive pressure from cloud/AI incumbents (e.g., AWS, Microsoft, Snowflake) and potential pricing/contracting pressures.
  - Regulatory and geopolitical risks affecting government contracting and international expansion plans.
  - Macro sensitivities impacting CAPEX cycles, IT budgets, and currency exposure for international customers.

Interpretation guidance for traders
- Growth vs. profitability balance: If the company can convert revenue growth into meaningful, positive operating cash flow and eventually GAAP profitability, the stock could be a multi-year value driver; otherwise, expect continued use of cash reserves or external funding to support growth.
- Margin trajectory: A sustained expansion in gross margins and a compression in operating expenses relative to revenue would be a positive signal for scaling profitability.
- Insider signals: Positive insider sentiment and purchases, if supported by improving financial metrics, could reinforce the case for holding or buying. Conversely, heavy insider selling without clear profitability progress may warrant caution.

Next steps (how I can proceed once data is available)
- Re-run the five data pulls:
  - Insider sentiment (Finnhub) – past 15 days
  - Insider transactions (Finnhub) – past 15 days
  - SimFin balance sheet (quarterly) – latest period
  - SimFin income statement (quarterly) – latest period
  - SimFin cash flow (quarterly) – latest period
- Compile the data into a final, data-backed sectioned report with exact figures, trend lines, and a refreshed set of ratios (gross margin, operating margin, FCF yield, debt/EBITDA, current ratio, etc.).
- Append an updated Markdown table with concrete numbers and signals.

Proposed next steps for you
- Would you like me to retry the data pulls now or wait until the backend issue is resolved? If you prefer, you can proceed by providing any specific dates or quarters you want prioritized (e.g., most recent quarterly results, or a focus on the government vs. commercial mix).
- If you have alternative data sources (or a snapshot you’ve already pulled), share them and I’ll integrate them into the report.
