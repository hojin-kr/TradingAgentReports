Recommendation: Hold (PLTR)

Rationale
- Core thesis remains intact: Palantir’s Foundry/Gotham platform and government exposure offer a durable moat and long-duration revenue. A path to higher margins exists if the software mix widens and scale efficiencies materialize.
- Near-term concerns persist: valuation remains premium without concrete, visible progress on margin expansion and free cash flow. Execution risk around Foundry commercialization and commercial diversification weighs on the speed of multiple re-rating.
- Data and signal limitations add uncertainty: near-term signals for ARR growth, renewals, and cash-flow progression are not yet decisive enough to justify a Buy at current levels.

Catalysts that could justify upgrading to Buy
- Margin improvement: clear gross margin expansion driven by software mix and reduced services intensity.
- Free cash flow or credible path to positive operating cash flow in coming quarters.
- Foundry/Commercial ramp: tangible ARR growth outside government, improving net-dollar retention, and lower churn.
- Diversification progress: reduced revenue concentration from a few large programs, with more mid-size commercial deals across multiple verticals.
- Stable renewal backdrop: backlog visibility improving with healthier renewal rates.

Position guidance
- If you already hold PLTR, maintain a core position but avoid adding aggressively at current levels.
- If under-allocated, avoid incremental buys until catalysts materialize. Consider staged exposure only after concrete cash-flow and margin milestones are reported.
- Consider small hedges if trading tactically: defined-risk options or short-dated hedges around known catalyst dates to limit downside while staying invested.

What to watch (operational/macro signals)
- ARR by segment (government vs. commercial), gross margin progression, operating cash flow, and free cash flow trajectory.
- Backlog renewals and renewal-rate trends; visibility into longer-tail government contracts.
- New commercial deals, onboarding velocity for Foundry, customer time-to-value, and net expansion per account.

Risk controls
- Maintain liquidity; avoid forced exits on macro headlines that aren’t supported by fundamentals.
- Use capped, risk-limited tactical exposures if you must stay exposed around catalysts.

Learning note
- No past decision history available to learn from here. Apply a disciplined framework: require tangible progress on margins, cash flow, and diversification before reclassifying to Buy.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
