I ran into a backend data fetch error trying to pull NVDA data (FileNotFoundError from get_YFin_data and from the stockstats indicators calls). I can retry fetching now, or proceed with a qualitative, framework-based analysis using the planned indicator lineup. Please tell me if you’d like me to retry immediately.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for NVDA (as of 2025-10-03 context) along with why they’re suitable:

Selected indicators and rationale
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction; helps identify dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming the broader trend suggested by longer-term indicators.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm the overall direction and catch golden/death-cross dynamics when combined with the 50-SMA.
- macd (MACD)
  - Why: Momentum-based trend-change signals via the MACD line crossovers; useful to spot shifts in acceleration not visible from price alone.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Why: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with the MACD line provide more robust entry/exit cues and help reduce false signals in volatile periods.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Why: Visualizes momentum strength and can hint at divergence early; adds a sense of momentum buildup or fading that complements MACD line signals.
- rsi (RSI)
  - Why: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold context and potential reversals; helpful for spotting extreme conditions within an existing trend when used with trend filters.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - Why: 20-period baseline to gauge price relative to a dynamic baseline; useful with bands to identify breakouts or reversals and to contextualize volatility.
- atr (ATR)
  - Why: Measures current volatility; aids in risk management by informing stop placement and position sizing aligned with market tempo.

What to watch when NVDA data is available
- Trend versus momentum alignment: If price remains above the 50 and 200 SMAs, look for MACD bullish cross and RSI staying below overbought extremes to time entries in uptrends. If price trades below these SMAs, require stronger negative momentum (MACD negative, RSI below 50, etc.) before considering shorts or hedges.
- Momentum vs volatility: A rising MACD histogram with rising ATR suggests momentum is picking up in a volatile environment—potential for larger moves but higher risk. A shrinking ATR with a positive MACD could signal consolidating momentum and possible range trading.
- Reversals and breakouts: RSI divergences paired with MACD crossovers near resistance or support (and Bollinger middle interactions with the price’s relation to the bands) can signal potential reversals or breakouts.
- Risk management: Use ATR to set wider or tighter stops based on current volatility; NVDA’s often wide price swings in tech/semis make ATR-driven sizing prudent.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data and compute the 8 indicators above, then produce a detailed, data-driven trend report with supporting observations, timestamps, and signal interpretations.
- If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-agnostic analysis based on typical NVDA behavior in recent market conditions while we resolve the data fetch issue.
