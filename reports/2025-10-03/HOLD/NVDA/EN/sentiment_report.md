I’m running into an issue pulling Reddit sentiment data right now due to an internal error from the Reddit information tool (FileNotFoundError). I can retry in a moment, but I don’t want to block you. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll proceed and what I can deliver, plus a plan for you to approve so we can move quickly once the data source is back up.

What I can deliver right now (without live Reddit data)
- A clear methodology you can rely on once the data tool is working again.
- A structured analysis framework for NVDA (NVIDIA) covering social sentiment, recent news impact, and implications for traders.
- A provisional reporting scaffold you can review and approve, so we only need to plug in the real data when available.
- A Markdown table layout (to append to the final report) that organizes key points for quick reading.

Plan and methodology (ready to execute once data access is restored)
1) Data collection
   - Source: Reddit stock-focused threads and any other social data accessible via the tool for the last 7 days (today and prior 6 days).
   - Granularity: Daily sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative) and top themes per day.
   - Context: Note retweets/comments with potential outsized influence (e.g., posts from high-rep users or moderators).

2) Sentiment analysis approach
   - Compute daily average sentiment score and sentiment distribution.
   - Extract recurring themes (e.g., data center demand, AI cycle, product announcements, supply chain, guidance, margins, competition).
   - Flag sentiment spikes and correlate with any notable company news or macro events.

3) News and events overlay
   - Track notable NVDA-related news in the past week (product news, earnings guidance, supply chain updates, regulatory developments, AI demand signals).
   - Assess whether sentiment shifts align with substantive news vs. noise.

4) Interpretation and trader-oriented insights
   - Identify whether sentiment is leaning bullish, bearish, or mixed, and whether the tone is accelerating or fading.
   - Link sentiment signals to potential trading implications:
     - Bullish sentiment spike with constructive news could imply upside continuation risk.
     - Bearish sentiment with negative news or driving concerns around margins/regulatory constraints could imply near-term pressure.
     - Plateauing or mixed sentiment may suggest a wait-and-see stance, especially ahead of any major catalysts.

5) Output artifacts
   - A comprehensive narrative with day-by-day sentiment trends, key themes, and implications for NVDA.
   - A concise risk/opportunity checklist for traders.
   - A final Markdown table summarizing the day-by-day insights (to be appended at the end of the full report).

What I will deliver when the tool comes back
- A full week-long NVDA social sentiment analysis with daily granularity.
- A synthesis of top themes driving sentiment.
- A tie-in with any recent company news to explain sentiment movements.
- A trader-focused implications section with concrete takeaways and risk factors.
- A Makrdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference.

Proposed quick-start table structure (you’ll see this filled with data once available)
- Date
- Source (Reddit thread/specific subreddit)
- Sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
- Daily Sentiment Score (e.g., -1 to 1 or +1 to -1 scale)
- Top Theme(s)
- Related News/Catalyst
- Signal Implication for NVDA
- Suggested Trader Action (if any)

Example placeholders (for review)
- 2025-10-03 | Reddit NVDA thread | Positive | 0.25 | Data center demand, AI cycle optimism | None detected beyond typical demand narrative | Upward drift if momentum continues | Consider watchlist + bullish tilt on breakout potential
- 2025-10-02 | Reddit NVDA thread | Negative | -0.12 | Supply chain concerns, pricing pressure rumors | Company guidance hints or macro noise not confirmed | Mixed signal; risk-off tilt in tech sector | Monitor for clarification in next earnings/updates
- 2025-10-01 | Reddit NVDA thread | Neutral | 0.05 | Broad AI sentiment moderating | Market-wide cooling after rally | Low activity; waits for catalysts | Hold; prepare for catalysts

Next steps
- I can retry pulling the Reddit data immediately or on your cue. If you’d like, I’ll attempt again and then deliver the full week-long NVDA sentiment report with the Markdown table appended.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with an alternate data set (e.g., other social platforms or public news sentiment) in parallel and stitch it into the same report structure.

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or would you like me to proceed with the framework and deliver the report once the data tool is back?
- If you’d like, I can also start assembling the news-overlay and a structured trader’s implications section using public sources I can access without the Reddit tool, and then integrate the Reddit data as soon as it’s available.
