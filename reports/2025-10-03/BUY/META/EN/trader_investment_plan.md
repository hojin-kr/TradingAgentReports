Decision: Proceed with a data-refresh attempt now to validate the plan with live META feeds and sentiment, while maintaining a Buy stance and a staged-entry approach.

Recommendation
- Buy META. Implement a disciplined, milestone-driven entry rather than full exposure today.

Rationale (condensed)
- Asymmetric upside from AI-enabled monetization and improved ad targeting could lift ARPU and margins over time, supported by CoreWeave compute advantages.
- Regional growth optionality (e.g., India) can provide decoupled growth from mature markets, helping diversify risk.
- META’s balance sheet and cash flow enable continued investment and selective buybacks, creating optionality even if near-term headwinds persist.
- Near-term risks (regulatory headwinds in Europe, front-loaded AI spend, metaverse uncertainty) are acknowledged but are expected to be manageable within a multi-year horizon if AI-driven monetization proves durable.

Strategic Actions (tiered-entry plan)
- Phase 1 now: Initiate a modest starter position representing 25-40% of the intended total META exposure, calibrated to your portfolio size and risk tolerance.
- Phase 2 on catalysts: Add 20-30% more if credible progress is seen on AI ROI metrics (cost-per-impression improvements, ARPU uplift) and early regional monetization traction (notably in high-growth markets).
- Phase 3 on validation: If CoreWeave milestones translate into tangible cost savings and faster AI-driven experimentation with measurable monetization impact, complete the remaining exposure.
- Position sizing: Align tranche sizes with your risk tolerance. More risk-averse investors should cap Phase 1 lower; more aggressive entrants can size Phase 1 larger but maintain clear stop rules.
- Risk controls and hedges:
  - Stop-loss: hard stop if downside exceeds 15-20% from entry on the current leg or if a key trend line is broken.
  - Catalyst hedges: consider modest put protections or a collar around earnings windows or EU regulatory milestones to cap downside while preserving upside.
  - Cost-efficient upside capture: consider a core long position with a modest protective option overlay (e.g., a calendar spread or a small protective put) to limit downside without sacrificing upside participation.
- Catalysts and monitoring (live watchlist):
  - AI ROI milestones: observed ad targeting improvements, CPM/ARPU lift tied to AI features, disclosures on CoreWeave-related cost savings.
  - Regional monetization progress: credible pilots translating into revenue lift in India or similar markets.
  - Regulatory timing: clarity on DSA/privacy developments and potential monetization impact in Europe.
  - CoreWeave milestones: deployment progress, real-world cost-per-impression reductions, and any profitability signals linked to AI workloads.
  - Earnings cadence: quarterly results showing resilience outside Europe and progress on monetization initiatives.
- Data hygiene and decision cadence:
  - Re-run quantitative checks as soon as data feeds return. If data gaps persist, rely on qualitative assessment and avoid over-committing capital.
  - Use a three-scenario framework (base/bull/bear) with probability weights to guide sizing and risk controls. Adjust exposure promptly if the base case deteriorates.

Post-data-refresh plan and learning loop
- If fresh data confirms AI ROI gains, regional traction, and manageable regulatory risk, scale into the plan per Phase 2/3.
- If data weakens the thesis, trim exposure or shift hedges accordingly and revisit the thesis with updated assumptions.
- Maintain discipline: separate near-term noise from long-run monetization drivers; define explicit risk controls and milestones before adjusting exposure.

Next step requested
- I will proceed with the data-refresh attempt now to fetch missing META feeds and Reddit sentiment, then revalidate the plan against live numbers. If you prefer, you can confirm and I’ll pause the refresh until you’re ready.

Final note
- If live data confirms progress on AI monetization and regional monetization milestones, the staged-entry plan should offer an asymmetric upside with controlled risk. If not, we can reassess quickly and adjust exposure.
