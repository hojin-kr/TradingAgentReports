I’m running into a data retrieval issue on the META request right now.

What happened
- The get_YFin_data tool returned a FileNotFoundError when trying to fetch META price data. It looks like the environment cannot access or locate the required CSV/data source for Yahoo Finance data at the moment. I can’t generate the full indicator outputs or the detailed trend report without that data.

What I can do now
- Propose a robust set of indicators (up to 8) that will give complementary insights once data access is restored.
- Provide a detailed framework for the report and a ready-to-use Markdown table of the chosen indicators. When data retrieval succeeds, I’ll fill in the live readings, trend nuances, and concrete trade implications.

Recommended 8 indicators for META (complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Identifies the medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helpful for gauging whether META is in a bullish or bearish phase on a monthly/weekly perspective.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful to confirm overall market direction and to spot golden/death cross setups when combined with shorter-term indicators.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  Why: Captures quick momentum shifts and potential near-term entry points. Helps filter signals from the slower SMAs.

- macd (MACD Related)
  Why: Core momentum indicator; crossovers and divergence can signal trend changes. Provides insight into whether price movement is gaining or losing breadth.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line offer more reliable trade triggers when used with other filters.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  Why: Highlights momentum strength and potential divergences early; useful for spotting momentum acceleration or deceleration.

- rsi (Momentum Indicators)
  Why: Identifies overbought/oversold conditions and divergences; helps anticipate reversals when aligned with trend signals.

- atr (Volatility Indicators)
  Why: Measures current volatility to inform risk management: stop placement, position sizing, and adaptability of entries/exits in changing volatility regimes.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A very detailed, nuanced report on META’s trend and momentum, including:
  - The alignment (or misalignment) of short-, medium-, and long-term trend signals.
  - Momentum confirmation or divergence clues from MACD-related lines and histogram.
  - RSI interpretations in the context of prevailing trend strength.
  - Volatility considerations from ATR to adjust risk controls.
  - Practical trade implications (entry, exit, stop placement) informed by the combination of these indicators.
  - Any notable divergences between price action and the indicators (e.g., price making new highs while RSI or MACD diverges).

Next steps
- If you’d like me to proceed, I can retry fetching META data now, or you can provide a CSV/Data file (or allow me to use an alternative data source) and I’ll run the indicators and complete the full report.
- Alternatively, I can continue with a qualitative overview based on typical behavior of META in recent periods, but the precise, data-backed insights will be provided once the data fetch succeeds.

Markdown table: Selected indicators and purpose

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now, say “retry META data fetch,” or provide an alternative data source, and I’ll proceed immediately.
