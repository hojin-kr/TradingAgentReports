I’m running into a tool error fetching Reddit stock news for META on 2025-10-03—the Reddit stock info tool is returning a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the backend data source for that function is currently unavailable. I can’t pull the live Reddit feed right now, but I can still move the analysis forward in a couple of ways. Here’s how we can proceed and what I’ll deliver:

What I can do now
- Provide a structured, high-signal framework for META’s sentiment and news analysis that you can use immediately, once data comes back online.
- Outline the key drivers, likely themes this week, and potential trading implications based on META’s business context (ads market, AI integrations, user engagement, regulatory risk, hardware/AR efforts).
- Prepare a ready-to-fill long-form report template and a Markdown summary table you can copy-paste when data is available.

What I propose next
- Retry data pull as soon as the Reddit stock-info tool is available again (I can trigger another fetch immediately if you’d like me to retry now or in a few minutes).
- If you have alternative sources you trust (X/Twitter sentiment, public threads, newswire blasts, Meta earnings/PR coverage), I can incorporate those manually and still deliver a thorough qualitative and quantitative-style view.
- Deliver a comprehensive META sentiment/news report with:
  - Daily sentiment sweep (last 7 days) plus a 3-day rolling average
  - Top themes driving sentiment (AI updates, ad market dynamics, user growth/engagement, regulatory/regulatory tech, metaverse/Reality Labs progress)
  - News pulse (sum up the week’s most impactful headlines)
  - Trading implications and risk flags
  - A concise, trader-focused takeaway

Proposed report structure (ready to fill once data arrives)
1) Executive snapshot
- Quick read on sentiment trend, notable events, and immediate implications.

2) Social sentiment analysis
- Daily sentiment counts (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
- Top keywords/themes per day
- Sentiment heat map across key topics (ads, AI, user engagement, privacy/regulatory)

3) News and catalysts (past week)
- Summary of major headlines
- Impact ranking (High/Medium/Low) and likely market impact
- Any gaps between news tone and stock price movement

4) Contextual drivers
- Industry: digital advertising cycle, AI adoption, competition (e.g., TikTok, other social platforms)
- Platform-specific factors: Reels monetization, AI features, privacy changes, developer ecosystem
- Regulatory/regulatory-tech considerations

5) Trading implications
- Short-term catalysts to watch
- Potential risk factors (policy changes, ad spend volatility, platform shifts)
- Scenarios and probability-weighted outcomes

6) Key risks and caveats
- Data limitations
- Sentiment vs. price action divergence risks
- Macro considerations (ad budgets, tech sector rotation)

7) Summary takeaways
- Bull/bear tilt and confidence level
- Quick-action ideas (entry/exit levels or hedges if you’re actively trading)

Sample starter points you can expect (high-level, non-data-specific)
- META’s sentiment often hinges on ad revenue trajectory and Meta’s AI feature rollout (which can buoy sentiment if perceived as revenue accelerant, or dampen it if users/advertisers push back).
- Regulatory risk tends to weigh on sentiment during any new scrutiny/legislation news, especially around data privacy and antitrust concerns.
- Developments in metaverse/Reality Labs and hardware partnerships can create sentiment swings if there’s tangible progress, or disappointment if timelines slip.
- Competitor dynamics (e.g., short-term shifts in ad share to competitors or changes in platform policy) can drive daily sentiment fluctuations.

Markdown table (ready to populate once data is in)
- I’ll append this at the end of the final report with filled values:
- Columns: Day, Sentiment (P/N/U), Key Themes, Top News Headline, Market Impact (Low/Med/High), Notes

Example entry scaffold:
- Day: 2025-09-XX
  - Sentiment: Positive
  - Key Themes: AI integration, stronger ad demand
  - Top News Headline: "Meta announces new AI-powered ad targeting features"
  - Market Impact: Medium
  - Notes: Early reactions priced in, watch next data point for confirmation

Would you like me to retry fetching the Reddit stock info now, or would you prefer I proceed with the plan to assemble the full report skeleton and wait for data to come back? If you have alternative sources you want included (e.g., specific X threads, Reddit subreddits, or news outlets), tell me which ones to prioritize and I’ll incorporate them as soon as possible.
