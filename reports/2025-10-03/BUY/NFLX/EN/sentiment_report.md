I ran into an internal error retrieving Reddit stock data for NFLX on 2025-10-03 (FileNotFoundError). I can try again, but I don’t want to spin wheels if the data source is temporarily unavailable. Here are two paths and I’ll follow the one you prefer:

- Path A (preferred if you want Reddit-specific social sentiment): I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then proceed with a full, minutely-detailed analysis of social sentiment, recent news, and implications for traders. If the tool still fails, I’ll switch to best-available public signals and clearly label them as non-Reddit sources.
- Path B (quick, robust without Reddit tool): I proceed with a comprehensive analysis using other public signals (press releases, earnings notes, headlines, official Netflix communications, and general social sentiment from other channels) for the past week, clearly noting the limitation of not using Reddit data for this window.

Please tell me which path you want. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan for the long report I would deliver, plus a ready-to-fill structure you can expect.

What I will deliver (once data is in)
- Executive snapshot: a concise read on NFLX’s current state from social sentiment, major news catalysts in the past week, and key risk/drive factors for traders.
- Daily sentiment view: a day-by-day breakdown of sentiment shifts (positive/neutral/negative) and notable drivers. If Reddit data is unavailable, I’ll annotate which sources are used instead and what color the signal might be (e.g., “headline-driven optimism”).
- Thematic sentiment analysis: recurring themes (content quality, streaming price/tier changes, ad-supported tier reception, password-sharing controls, new content partnerships, earnings whispers, competitive dynamics, platform outages).
- Newsflow synthesis (past week): summarize company announcements, major press headlines, investor relations notes, and external events impacting NFLX (competitors, regulatory topics, macro context).
- Market interpretation and trader implications: how sentiment and news align with price/volume behavior, potential catalysts, and nuanced takeaways for different trading horizons (intra-week, swing, longer-term).
- Risk assessment: data quality caveats, potential sentiment reversals, event risk (earnings, price changes, policy changes), and what would invalidate the current sentiment picture.
- Actionable takeaways: pragmatic notes for traders (entry/exit considerations, hedging ideas, watchlist triggers).
- Appendices: data source notes, methodology, and any assumptions.

What the final report will include (structure you’ll see)
- Section 1: Snapshot and Context
  - Short-term mood indicators
  - Key headlines driving sentiment
  - Any notable shifts in user engagement or product roadmap signals
- Section 2: Daily Sentiment and Themes (last 7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment tally (Positive/Neutral/Negative)
  - Top themes per day with brief quotes or paraphrases (if available)
- Section 3: News/Catalysts Review (last 7 days)
  - Summaries of official Netflix announcements, investor notices, earnings discourse, and material media coverage
  - Implications for brand perception, monetization strategy, and subscriber dynamics
- Section 4: Sentiment vs Price/Volatility (where data allows)
  - Correlations or mismatches between sentiment shifts and market moves
  - Implied volatility or options signals (if accessible)
- Section 5: Risk and Counterpoints
  - What could derail the current sentiment trend
  - Potential overhangs or tail risks (competition, regulatory, content slate risks)
- Section 6: Trader Recommendations
  - Short-term view (days to weeks)
  - Medium-term view (weeks)
  - Suggested watchlist and triggers
- Section 7: Data Appendix
  - Sources, date ranges, and any exclusions

Proposed Makrdown table (to append at the end of the report)
Note: This is a template you’ll see filled with real data after I pull the sources. I’ll replace TBD with actual values.

| Date (Past 7 days) | Source Type | Theme or Story | Sentiment (P/N/U) | Approx. Impact on Price / Vol | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-09-27 | Reddit (if available) / Alternative source | Theme example: Ad-supported tier reception | Positive / Neutral / Negative | Low / Medium / High | Medium |
| 2025-09-28 | News headline | Theme example: Content slate / subscriber growth cues | Positive / Neutral / Negative | Low / Medium / High | Medium |
| 2025-09-29 | Social buzz | Theme example: Price action expectations | Positive / Neutral / Negative | Low / Medium / High | Medium |
| 2025-09-30 | Company press release | Theme example: Monetization / ARPU signals | Positive / Neutral / Negative | Low / Medium / High | High |
| 2025-10-01 | Analyst note / media | Theme example: Competitive dynamics | Positive / Neutral / Negative | Low / Medium / High | Medium |

How you want to proceed
- If you’d like Path A (attempt Reddit data again), I’ll retry the data fetch now and proceed with the full report as soon as I have the data, clearly labeling Reddit-derived insights when they come in.
- If you’d prefer Path B, I’ll start assembling the full, detailed analysis using alternative sources for the past week and present a thorough, trader-focused report with the same structure and the markdown table appended.

Also, if you have any preference for the depth (e.g., you want a 1,500-word briefing vs a 3,000-word deep dive), tell me and I’ll tailor the depth accordingly.
