I attempted to fetch NFLX data and compute the selected indicators, but the data retrieval step failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the environment. I can retry the data fetch now or after a short pause, or proceed with the plan and outline how I’ll interpret the indicators once the data is available. Please tell me whether you want me to retry immediately.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) for NFLX in the current market context
Rationale: The following set provides a balanced view of trend direction (long/medium term), momentum, mean-reversion signals, and volatility without heavy redundancy. They cover price structure, momentum, and volatility, and are suitable for a large-cap tech/entertainment stock like NFLX.

- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it tells: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Look for price above/below 50SMA for trend bias; use crossovers with price as a potential pullback/bounce signal.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it tells: Long-term trend context and major support/resistance level; classic trend filter.
  - How to use: Confirm major trend direction; watch for golden cross/death cross signals in conjunction with price action and other momentum signals.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it tells: Short-term momentum and recent price shifts.
  - How to use: Use as a quicker signal to complement the 50/200 SMA trend; potential entry/exit timing when aligned with other indicators.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it tells: Momentum and potential trend changes via MACD line vs. signal line.
  - How to use: Crossover signals (MACD line crossing above/below the signal line) with consideration of trend context from moving averages.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it tells: Momentum strength and shifts; divergence from price action.
  - How to use: Look for growing histogram bars confirming MACD cross signals; watch for divergences as early risk signals.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it tells: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: Use around 70/30 thresholds; consider divergences with price; in strong uptrends RSI can stay overbought for extended periods—use with trend confirmation.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it tells: Market volatility level and average price range per period.
  - How to use: Inform stop placement and position sizing; higher ATR suggests wider stops; lower ATR suggests tighter risk control.

- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - What it tells: Baseline price around a 20-period moving average; helps gauge price deviation and potential breakouts with bands.
  - How to use: Use in conjunction with price relative to the middle line and with other volatility cues (e.g., ATR) to assess breakouts/reversals and band-walking behavior.

Notes on interpretation in NFLX context
- Trend vs. momentum: If price stays above 50SMA and 200SMA with a rising 10EMA, the bias is bullish; MACD/macd-h would ideally confirm with positive momentum, while RSI stays constructive (not severely overbought).
- Breakouts: Boll middle alongside ATR can highlight periods where price is consolidating, then expands; watch for price action above/below the Bollinger bands in alignment with MACD trend signals.
- Risk management: Use ATR to set adaptive stop-loss ranges; VWMA is not in this final 8-indicator set to avoid redundancy, but if you want an additional volume filter later, we can substitute or add VWMA.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the NFLX data now and then generate the full, detailed report with actual indicator values and trend observations. If you want me to proceed with the retry, say “retry now.”
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative run-through using the planned indicators and outline the exact decision rules I would apply once the data is available, along with a structured report and a final table of insights.

Markdown table: key indicators, category, and purpose
- This table is a concise reference for the 8 indicators I’ve selected and how they contribute to the NFLX analysis.

If you’d like me to retry now, I’ll perform the data fetch again and then provide a fully populated, nuanced report with observed trends, cross-indicator signals, and actionable trade ideas based on NFLX data.
