I attempted to pull AMD data for 2024-01-01 to 2025-10-03 to compute indicators, but I hit an internal data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data fetch, or proceed with a robust indicator framework you can use once data is available. Below is a curated set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for AMD, along with how to use them and the rationale in a general AMD context.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8 indicators)
1) close_50_sma
- What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- How to use: If price trades above the 50 SMA, it suggests a bullish intermediate trend; price below may indicate a bearish interim trend. Look for crossovers of price and the 50 SMA as potential pullback/bounce signals.
- Rationale for AMD: AMD often trades with identifiable mid-term trend shifts around quarterly results or product cycles; the 50 SMA acts as a solid hedge against short-term noise.

2) close_200_sma
- What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend benchmark.
- How to use: Use for trend confirmation (price above 200 SMA = long-term uptrend; below = downtrend). Golden/death cross with shorter moving averages can signal stronger trend changes.
- Rationale for AMD: Long-term trend context is valuable given large cap tech dynamics and cyclical semis cycles; helps confirm the durability of any bullish/bearish bias.

3) close_10_ema
- What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average; responsive short-term trend/momentum.
- How to use: Watch for price crossing above/below the 10 EMA for quick momentum shifts. Generally used as a fast filter before taking entries in the direction of longer-term trends.
- Rationale for AMD: Provides timely read on momentum around product launches, earnings, or guidance updates when a quick move may occur.

4) macd
- What it measures: MACD line (fast vs slow EMA difference); momentum.
- How to use: Look for MACD line crossing the MACD signal line as potential entry/exit signals; consider divergence with price for early trend-change hints.
- Rationale for AMD: MACD helps confirm shifts in momentum around events that impact sentiment (e.g., earnings, AI/semiconductor demand news).

5) macds
- What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD); smoother momentum baseline.
- How to use: Crossovers of MACD vs MACD Signal can provide more reliable timing when used with price trend and other indicators.
- Rationale for AMD: The MACD cross can help validate or question MACD cross signals, reducing false entries in a volatile period.

6) macdh
- What it measures: MACD histogram; momentum strength and acceleration/deceleration.
- How to use: Rising histogram suggests strengthening momentum (bullish), falling histogram suggests waning momentum (bearish). Look for histogram divergences with price for early warning signals.
- Rationale for AMD: Helps gauge momentum strength around sharp price moves, which are common after earnings or chip-cycle updates.

7) rsi
- What it measures: Relative Strength Index; momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
- How to use: Relative thresholds (e.g., >70 overbought, <30 oversold) can flag potential reversals or persistence of a trend in overbought/oversold territory. Use RSI in conjunction with trend indicators to avoid misreads during strong trends.
- Rationale for AMD: RSI adds a momentum/breath check to avoid buying into overbought rallies or selling into oversold dips when the broader trend is favorable.

8) atr
- What it measures: Average True Range; volatility magnitude.
- How to use: Use ATR to set position sizing and volatility-adjusted stops. Rising ATR implies higher risk and wider stops; falling ATR implies tighter stops and potentially tighter risk management.
- Rationale for AMD: Semiconductor stocks can experience bursts of volatility around earnings, guidance shifts, or supply-demand news; ATR helps manage risk accordingly.

How these indicators work together (trade-trade framework)
- Trend context: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to establish whether AMD is in a longer-term uptrend, downtrend, or range. Confirm with price-action around those levels.
- Momentum signals: Use close_10_ema in conjunction with macd/macds/macdh to time entries with momentum confirmation. If price is above the 50/200 SMA and MACD components show bullish momentum (MACD line above signal, positive histogram growth), it strengthens a bullish bias.
- Momentum strength vs. risk: Use macd/macds/macdh in tandem with RSI to avoid chasing overextended moves. If RSI is overbought but MACD/momentum signals remain positive and ATR indicates rising volatility, be cautious with new long entries or widen stops.
- Risk management: Always frame ATR-based stop levels to adapt to current volatility. This helps AMD trades withstand earnings-driven volatility while preserving capital.

Notes and next steps
- Data access issue: I couldn't fetch the actual AMD price data due to an internal data path error. If you’d like, I can retry the data pull now, or wait for you to confirm when data access is restored.
- Once data is available, I can:
  - Compute the 8 indicators listed above for the requested date range.
  - Provide a detailed, point-by-point trend and signal interpretation tailored to AMD as of the current date (2025-10-03) using the exact values.
  - Offer concrete trading ideas (entry, stop, and target concepts) aligned with your preferred risk tolerance.

Proposed quick-reference table of indicators
- Note: This is a summary for decision-making once data is fetched.

| close_200_sma  | Long-term trend context                        | Price above = long-term uptrend; price below = downtrend; golden/death cross cues | Align with MACD momentum direction |
| close_10_ema   | Short-term momentum                            | Cross above/below 10 EMA for quick entries/exits                    | Use with MACD and RSI for confirmation |

| macdh          | MACD histogram momentum strength/direction      | Rising histogram = strengthening momentum; diverge with price = alert | Combine with RSI for overbought/oversold context |
| rsi            | Momentum / overbought-oversold                 | >70 overbought, <30 oversold; watch for divergences                   | Use with trend signals to avoid false reversals |
| atr            | Volatility & risk management                   | Higher ATR = wider stops; adjust position sizes accordingly            | Use for stop placement and risk planning |

Next steps
- If you want me to proceed, please confirm:
  - I should retry fetching AMD data now.
  - Or you can provide a data snapshot (prices and lows/highs/close) for the date range, and I’ll compute the indicators and deliver an actionable analysis.

I’ll stand by for your preference to retry data retrieval or proceed with the indicator framework once data access is restored.
