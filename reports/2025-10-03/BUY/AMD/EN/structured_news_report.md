# Daily Trading Intelligence: AMD

## Executive Snapshot
- AI infrastructure demand remains the key driver with expanding partnerships (IBM Zyphra; Cohere) supporting enterprise AI workloads and data-center GPU demand.
- Foundry/manufacturing chatter around Intel as a potential AMD foundry partner re-emerges as a near-term sentiment catalyst; execution risk remains high.
- Cadence on next-gen tech (TSMC 2nm, Zen 6, RDNA/UDNA, Dense Geometry Format) supports competitive efficiency and AI compute positioning.
- Near-term price action hinges on credibility of Intel-IFS talks; key levels: **support ~155–160**, **resistance ~170–180**. A break above 180 could target **190–210**; break below 150 could shift risk downward.

## Macro Backdrop
- AI capex cycle and Nvidia-driven AI rally set the broader tone; AMD sits to gain from data-center AI deployment but remains subject to Nvidia’s dominance and cloud budgets.
- Cloud spend/funding cycles, FX headwinds, and global manufacturing diversification narratives (US manufacturing resilience) shape sentiment on AMD’s supply/demand profile.
- Regulatory/government approval risk compounds any material foundry deal dynamics.

## Company-Specific Catalysts and News
- Foundry/Supply:
  - Intel-AMD foundry talks resurface; potential use of Intel Foundry Services for AMD designs (node considerations: 18A/14A). Execution risk and regulatory approvals are critical.
- AI Infrastructure Partnerships:
  - IBM Zyphra collaboration: AMD Instinct GPUs powering Zyphra workloads on IBM Cloud; enhances enterprise AI deployment visibility.
  - Cohere expansion: Enterprise/sovereign AI focus broadens AMD’s AI workload footprint beyond hyperscalers.
- Next-Gen Hardware & Architecture:
  - Cadence around TSMC 2nm process, Zen 6 roadmap, RDNA5/UDNA progress, and Dense Geometry Format enhancements; points to ongoing efficiency gains and AI performance uplift.
- Market Context:
  - Nvidia-led AI rally backdrop; AMD’s advantage hinges on AI workload wins and partner depth to maintain share amid a dominant Nvidia environment.
  - Cloud capex sensitivity and possible FX headwinds; regulatory and onshoring themes could influence supply dynamics.

## Price Action and Technical Levels
- Key levels to watch:
  - **Resistance: 170–180** zone; a breakout above this area could accelerate momentum toward **190–210**.
  - **Support: 155–160**; a break below this zone opens risk toward **150** and lower (down to **145–148** in a test).
- Near-term setup implies a risk-on tilt on a clean break above 180; adverse headlines or cooling AI demand can re-introduce risk to the downside.
- Trend context: momentum remains sensitive to headline catalysts (foundry talk credibility; AI contract wins).

## Trading Scenarios and Outlook
- Base Case
  - Price action: trades in a barbell around 165–185; occasional tests of 170–180.
  - Targets: near-term resistance breakout to **185–190**; if held, potential drift toward **190–195**.
  - Risk: pullbacks to **155–160**; stop-loss suggested below **152–154** on a short-term long.

- Bull Case
  - Catalysts: credible, scalable Intel-foundry agreement; expanding IBM Zyphra/Cohere deployments; Zen 6/2nm milestones materialize.
  - Targets: **190–210** (and potentially higher into 210–220 if AI demand remains robust and supply constraints ease).
  - Risk controls: defer leverage until 180 breaks convincingly; use stops near **170**.

- Bear Case
  - Triggers: Intel talks stall; AI demand decelerates; Nvidia pricing/semis supply dynamics tighten; 2nm/advanced process delays.
  - Targets: pullback to **150–155**; further downside toward **145–148** if 150 breaks.
  - Risk controls: hedge or reduce exposure near resistance; trim on strength failing to clear 180.

## Key Data Points Summary
- Catalysts to monitor
  - Credible Intel-Foundry deal updates (capacity commitments, node strategy, approvals)
  - IBM Zyphra deployment milestones; Cohere enterprise/sovereign uptake
  - Zen 6 progression; RDNA/UDNA updates; 2nm process milestones with TSMC
- Price level anchors
  - Support: **155–160**; strong basal support around **150**
  - Resistance: **170–180**; key breakout level at **180**
  - Momentum targets if breakout occurs: **190–210** (near-term); longer horizon into **210–220** if sustained
- Risk management notes
  - Event-driven volatility around headlines
  - Maintain defined stop framework and consider hedges near major resistance or risk triggers
