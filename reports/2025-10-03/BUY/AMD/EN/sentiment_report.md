I ran the Reddit stock-info fetch for AMD for the requested date range, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) for the batch parallel call and for the single-date call. It looks like a tool/environment issue rather than a data problem.

What I can do next
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again, either for a single day (10-03) or in smaller batches (e.g., 09-27, 09-28, etc.). If the tool is still failing, I’ll pause and switch to an alt plan.
- Alternate plan if the tool remains down: I can proceed with a structured AMD report using other publicly available signals (e.g., mainstream news, earnings guidance, product cycle news, supply/demand context) and clearly mark sentiment data as “pending from Reddit tool” when I can fetch it.

Proposed plan for progress
1) Attempt to fetch Reddit sentiment for AMD again (start with the latest date 2025-10-03, then backfill 09-27 to 10-02 if successful).
2) Compile a granular, day-by-day sentiment view (positive/neutral/negative) and extract top themes from the most-referenced threads each day.
3) Integrate recent AMD company news (product launches, earnings, partnerships, supply chain updates) into a sentiment-impact framework.
4) Deliver a comprehensive long-form report with:
   - Fine-grained sentiment breakdown by date
   - Key topics driving sentiment (AI/data center, gaming GPUs, supply constraints, competitor context)
   - Relationship to stock price and volume action
   - Trade implications and risk factors for traders
   - A concise “What to watch next” section with catalysts
   - A Markdown table at the end organizing key points (as requested)

What I need from you
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch now (start with 2025-10-03 and proceed backward if successful), or would you prefer I proceed with the outline and wait for the tool to come back online?

If you’d like, I can also provide an interim high-level AMD sentiment framework now (without Reddit data yet) so you have something concrete to review while we troubleshoot the tool:
- Daily sentiment snapshot structure (positive/neutral/negative counts)
- Top themes expected to surface (AI/data center demand, GPU/CPUs cadence, supply chain/news catalysts)
- Potential risk factors and catalysts to watch over the next 1–2 weeks

Note: Since the current date is 2025-10-03, I’ll format the final report to cover the week leading up to today and include a clear note where Reddit-derived sentiment is pending.
