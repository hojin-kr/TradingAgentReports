Recommendation: Buy, but with a disciplined, data-driven, phased entry and tight risk controls.

Key takeaways aligned with the plan
- Long-term thesis remains compelling: AMD’s multi-product platform (Instinct AI GPUs, EPYC CPUs, RDNA accelerators) targets a broad AI compute TAM beyond consumer gaming, supported by enterprise and sovereign partnerships and a potential efficiency edge from chiplet design and upcoming process nodes.
- Risks exist and are manageable with discipline: Nvidia’s ecosystem moat, macro softness, and execution/foundry cadence are real headwinds. A staged entry and defined downside protections help balance upside with risk.

Actionable execution plan
- Initial entry and sizing
  - Start with a modest initial position representing about 1/3 of the planned stake to test thesis with real-time data.
  - Plan to add on strength: if AMD demonstrates a clear uptrend (price above the 50-day EMA, rising volume, positive momentum signals such as MACD), deploy the remaining tranches over 2–3 steps.
  - If momentum deteriorates (price breaks below the 50-day EMA with negative MACD/RSI rollover), pause and reassess; trim or exit if risk controls trigger.
- Risk controls and hedging
  - Use ATR-based stops: initial stop 1.5–2.5 ATR below entry, adjusted as price moves.
  - Consider optional protective puts around major catalysts (earnings, AI announcements) to cap downside while preserving upside.
  - Limit single-name risk to 3–6% of the portfolio, depending on diversification and risk tolerance.
- Price targets and exit rules
  - Near-term target: 15–25% upside within 6–12 months, with a trailing stop to lock in gains.
  - Longer-term potential: 30–50% above entry if AI demand, margins, and design-wins prove resilient and guidance improves.
  - If catalysts underperform (slower AI uptake, weaker bookings, margin compression), proactively trim or exit according to predefined levels.
- Catalysts and monitoring
  - Key signals: enterprise/Sovereign AI traction (e.g., design wins, bookings), gross margin expansion from mix, and disciplined capital allocation.
  - Technical/momentum checks: watch for 50/200-day crossovers, MACD, RSI, and volume spikes as confirmation to scale or reduce exposure.
- Execution cadence
  - Begin now with a small entry; escalate on confirmed uptrends or pullbacks to defined support with favorable indicators.
  - Review the position every 4–8 weeks around catalysts; adjust stops and targets with new data.

Rationale anchored in the plan
- Diversified AI compute exposure: AMD’s platform approach mitigates single-driver risk and aims to capture growth across training, inference, and enterprise workloads.
- Manageable risk framework: The phased entry, explicit stop rules, and hedging options align with a risk-conscious execution that can adapt to evolving AI cycles and macro signals.
- Clear catalysts and cadence: Earnings guidance, enterprise bookings, and tangible design wins are the best evidence for upside durability; these should be tracked closely to validate scaling decisions.

Bottom line
- The investment plan supports a Buy thesis, but only with a structured, staged approach, strict risk controls, and ongoing validation of catalysts. If the data and momentum stay favorable, add-on positions can capture upside; if not, risk controls should limit downside.
