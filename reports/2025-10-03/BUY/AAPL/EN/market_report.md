Thanks for your patience. I’m running into a backend issue fetching the data for AAPL right now:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

This looks like a temporary problem with the data source the tool relies on. I can either retry fetching the data now, or we can proceed with a prepared indicator plan and run as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Here’s what I’ll do (once data is available) and why these indicators are a strong, complementary mix for AAPL today:

Selected indicators (up to 8, diverse and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: Identifies medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming the broader trend alongside faster signals.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark and helps spot golden/death cross signals. Great for context on major trend regime.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum, helping to flag quick shifts and entry opportunities. Works well with the longer SMAs to filter noise.
- macd: Momentum/trend-change signal via MACD line crossovers and divergence. Adds a robust momentum check beyond price action.
- macds: MACD Signal line; crossovers with MACD provide clearer trade signals and help reduce whipsaws.
- rsi: Momentum strength; overbought/oversold cues (with divergence context) to anticipate potential reversals when used with trend signals.
- atr: Volatility gauge for risk management; informs stop placement and position sizing in relation to current volatility.
- vwma: Volume-confirmed trend; helps validate price moves with volume, reducing false signals from price action alone.

Rationale for the mix
- Trend confirmation: 50/200 SMA plus 10 EMA gives a layered view of trend strength across short/medium/long horizons.
- Momentum: MACD family plus RSI provides both lagging (macd/macds) and momentum (RSI) perspectives to detect potential entries or exits.
- Volatility & risk: ATR helps calibrate risk, while VWMA adds a volume dimension to confirm that price moves are supported by trading activity.
- Complementarity: These eight cover trend, momentum, volatility, and volume without relying on the same construct (e.g., no Stochastics), reducing redundancy while offering diverse signals.

What I’ll deliver when data loads
- A detailed trend report for AAPL with:
  - Current trend direction from MAs (crossovers, current price relative to 50/200 SMA).
  - Momentum signals (MACD/macdS cross status, RSI level and divergence context).
  - Volatility and risk context (ATR-based stop/position sizing implications).
  - Volume-confirmation (VWMA signals).
- A concise trading view with actionable takeaways and a Markdown table summarizing key readings.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now. Would you like me to attempt the data retrieval again immediately, or would you prefer I proceed with the indicator plan and report once the data is available? If you want, I can also try a narrowed date window or a smaller range to test the connection.

Note: If you’d like me to try immediately, say “Retry data fetch now,” and I’ll initiate another fetch and then run the indicators you requested.
