Sorry about that. The Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError when I tried to fetch AAPL data for 2025-10-03. It looks like the data source for that date isn’t available in the current environment, or there’s an internal path issue.

What I can do next:
1) Retry with the same parameters (AAPL, 2025-10-03) to see if it was a transient glitch.
2) Try a nearby date (e.g., 2025-10-02 or 2025-09-30) to still capture recent sentiment around the same period.
3) If you prefer, switch to a fallback approach and proceed with a qualitative, source-agnostic sentiment and news synthesis for the past week using publicly available information (headlines, product/news events, and general sentiment cues) while I wait for the Reddit tool to stabilize.
4) Proceed with a structured framework and fill in details as soon as the tool returns results, then append the Makrheadown table at the end.

If you’d like, I can:
- Retry now with a nearby date (e.g., 2025-10-02) and report back.
- Or proceed with option 3 (qualitative synthesis) immediately and clearly mark it as a synthesis pending direct Reddit data. 

How would you like to proceed?
