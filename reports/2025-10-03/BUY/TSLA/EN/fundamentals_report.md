I’m running into a backend data fetch issue right now. The attempts to pull TSLA’s quarterly balance sheet, cash flow, income statement, and insider data via the SimFin/Finnhub tools returned FileNotFoundErrors. Because of this, I don’t yet have the latest financial figures or insider activity to include in a fully data-backed report.

What I can do now
- Option A: Retry data pulls now and deliver a complete, numbers-backed fundamentals report as soon as the data tools succeed.
- Option B: Proceed with a comprehensive qualitative framework (structure, methodology, and analysis) using placeholders for the numeric data, so you have a ready-to-fill template you can update quickly once the data comes through.

Would you like me to retry the data pulls now, or proceed with the qualitative/template version? If you have a preference for quarterly vs trailing twelve months (TTM) data, or for specific data points (e.g., EBITDA, free cash flow, cash/debt levels), tell me and I’ll tailor the template accordingly.

Next steps

Would you like me to retry now or proceed with the template-based report in the meantime?
