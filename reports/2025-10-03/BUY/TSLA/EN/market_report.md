I attempted to fetch TSLA data to generate a data-backed indicator report, but I’m currently seeing a backend error (FileNotFoundError) from the data retrieval step. I can’t produce a live, data-driven trend report right now. I can still move you forward in two ways:
- Propose a robust 8-indicator setup that works well for TSLA in volatile conditions (so you’re ready as soon as data loads).
- Provide a detailed interpretation framework you can use once the data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why TSLA: Helps filter out very short-term noise and confirms broader trend direction.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation; golden/death cross context.
  - Why TSLA: TSLA often experiences prolonged momentum phases; the 200-SMA helps validate secular trend.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum; responds quickly to price shifts.
  - Why TSLA: Captures early momentum changes that longer averages may miss; useful for timely entries/exits in a volatile stock.

- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; crossovers signal potential trend changes.
  - Why TSLA: TSLA often shows rapid momentum shifts; MACD helps identify convergence/divergence with price.

- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (smoothing of MACD line).
  - Why TSLA: MACD crossovers with the MACD line provide more confirmed momentum signals when price is moving.

- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD Histogram; momentum strength and potential divergence.
  - Why TSLA: Histogram changes can hint at accelerating or fading momentum ahead of price moves.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - What it measures: Relative strength; overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why TSLA: In high-volatility regimes, RSI helps avoid chasing near-term overbought/oversold extremes, especially when combined with trend context.

- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it measures: Average true range; volatility magnitude.
  - Why TSLA: Essential for risk management in a volatile name; informs stop placement and position sizing.

Rationale and how to use together (without data yet)
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma, close_200_sma, and close_10_ema together to identify if price is trending up or down. A price above all three, or a bullish cross of the 10-EMA above the 50/200 SMA, supports a bullish bias; the reverse supports a bearish/bust scenario.
- Momentum confirmation: Use macd, macds, and macdh in conjunction with price action. Look for MACD line crossing above the signal line and a rising histogram to confirm upside momentum; look for crosses below with a shrinking histogram to confirm downside momentum.
- Overbought/oversold context: RSI provides a momentum checkpoint. In uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; in downtrends, RSI can stay oversold. Use RSI signals in the context of the prevailing trend indicated by the moving averages and MACD.
- Volatility and risk management: ATR informs you how much price moves on average, helping you set stops/size. In TSLA’s typical environment, a higher ATR warrants wider stops, but ensure you’re not overexposed to a single move.

What to do once data loads
- Re-run the analysis with TSLA data for your chosen window (e.g., last 6–12 months or YTD) to get precise readings and signals from these indicators.
- Generate a composite signal, for example:
  - Bullish setup: price above 50/200 SMA and 10-EMA above both, MACD above signal with increasing histogram, RSI trending up but not in extreme overbought territory, ATR indicating elevated but manageable volatility.
  - Bearish setup: price below 50/200 SMA and 10-EMA below, MACD below signal with decreasing histogram, RSI turning down from overbought, ATR rising (confirming volatility expansion in a down move).

Next steps and options
- Option A: I retry data retrieval now or with adjusted date ranges (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-10-03) to generate the full report.
- Option B: You authorize a qualitative/Twitter-news focused interpretation in the meantime, using the above indicators as a framework but without live data.
- Option C: You provide a preferred time frame (daily vs intraday) and a trading style (swing, day, or position) to tailor the interpretation once data is available.

Would you like me to retry fetching TSLA data now with the same or a different date range, or proceed with a narrative-based interpretation using these indicators and typical TSLA behavior in current market conditions?

Key points at a glance (for quick reference)
- 8-indicator setup recommended: 50-SMA, 200-SMA, 10-EMA, MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram, RSI, ATR
- Core purpose: balance trend (MAs), momentum (MACD trio, RSI), and volatility risk (ATR)
- TSLA-specific take: lean on MACD for momentum shifts, RSI for overbought/oversold context during trends, ATR for sizing and stop placement in a volatile stock

Markdown table: key points
- Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for TSLA
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Confirm trend direction; watch for price crossing or stabilizing around the 50-SMA
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; golden/death cross context | Use for macro-trend confirmation; cross of 50/200 can signal regime change
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; responsive | Early entry/exit signals; use with longer MA filters
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMA differences; trend changes | Look for line-cross with signal, divergence with price
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line smoothing | Confirm MACD-generated signals; reduces false positives
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength via histogram | Rising histogram supports momentum; shrinking/negative indicates fading momentum
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold | Use with trend cues; avoid against strong trend if RSI is extreme
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Price volatility magnitude | Guide stop placement and position sizing in TSLA’s volatile environment

If you want, I can proceed with Option A and retry the data fetch now. Just say “retry TSLA data,” and I’ll try again (or specify a date range you prefer).
