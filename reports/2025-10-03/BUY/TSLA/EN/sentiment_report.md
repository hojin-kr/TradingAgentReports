Thanks for the update. I attempted to pull the latest TSLA Reddit sentiment data for 2025-10-03, but the tool call returned a FileNotFoundError from the underlying data source. I can retry the data pull, or you can approve proceeding with a robust interim analysis using a structured framework while we wait for the data tool to come back online.

Here are two options to move forward:

Option A: Retry data pull now
- I’ll attempt another fetch of the latest Reddit stock info for TSLA (2025-10-03) and then produce a detailed, data-backed analysis with day-by-day sentiment, key themes, and implications for traders.
- If the tool persists failing, I’ll switch to Option B automatically and continue with a thorough qualitative framework.

Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, data-light analysis (no tool data)
- I’ll deliver a comprehensive framework and insights based on typical drivers and known recent catalysts for TSLA, clearly labeling which parts are data-driven (pending tool data) vs. qualitative.
- I’ll outline actionable trading implications and include a Markdown table layout that will be populated with concrete figures as soon as the Reddit data tool is available.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll attempt the fetch again immediately. If you prefer Option B, I’ll start with the framework right away and clearly mark placeholders where sentiment data will go.

Here’s the planned structure I’ll deliver (for either option, with data once available):

- Executive snapshot
  - Quick read on current sentiment mood (bullish/bearish/mixed), notable shifts over the past week, and any standout narrative (e.g., AI/Last-mile updates, FSD progress, production milestones).
- Daily sentiment cadence (past 7 days)
  - Day-by-day summary of Reddit sentiment strength, post volume, and top themes.
  - Any anomalies around key events (e.g., major news, product updates, supply chain chatter).
- Core themes and narratives
  - Prominent topics driving sentiment (e.g., EV demand signals, price/debts, supply chain, FSD/AI chatter, margins, manufacturing updates).
  - Polarizing opinions and the split between long-term bulls vs. near-term traders.
- Notable news items (past week)
  - Any official Tesla disclosures, earnings whispers, regulatory updates, or notable supplier/news events that influenced sentiment.
- Sentiment vs. price action
  - Correlation or lag between Reddit sentiment shifts and TSLA price/mv/rank moves during the period.
  - Any observed sentiment-driven volatility spikes.
- Risk checks
  - Key risk signals (e.g., rising bear chatter on valuation, execution concerns, regulatory risk) and their potential impact on short- to medium-term trades.
- Trade-oriented implications
  - Short-term tactical ideas (e.g., sentiment-driven skew, options positioning hints) and longer-term considerations.
- What to watch next
  - Upcoming catalysts, data releases, or events that could shift sentiment.

- Markdown table (to be appended at the end)
  - Rows: Key points (Executive snapshot, Daily sentiment, Core themes, Notable news, Sentiment vs price, Risks, Trade ideas, Catalysts)
  - Columns: Timeframe, Tulip-style bullet points, Data status (confirmed/pending), Implications

If you want me to proceed now, say “Retry now” for Option A, or “Proceed with Option B” and I’ll deliver the qualitative framework immediately with placeholders for data. Also, if you have any preference on specific subreddits or sentiment metrics you want tracked (e.g., post volume thresholds, emoji sentiment, or moderator comments), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis accordingly.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull now (Option A) or proceed with the framework (Option B)?
