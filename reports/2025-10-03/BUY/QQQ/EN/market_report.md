Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the data for QQQ to generate the indicator signals, but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError). I don’t have the raw price series to compute the indicators right now. I’ll outline a robust, non-redundant set of indicators you can use for QQQ and how to interpret them, plus actionable rules you can apply once the data load succeeds. If you want, I can retry data retrieval immediately or you can retry on your end and share the data/outputs for a precise, chart-specific interpretation.

Recommended indicator set (non-redundant, complementary)
- close_10_ema
  Why: Captures short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action. Useful for timely entries/exits when combined with longer-term trend filters.
- close_50_sma
  Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps filter noise from the short-term moves.
- close_200_sma
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Great for identifying the primary regime (bullish vs bearish) and for evaluating major trend changes (golden/death cross contexts).
- macd
  Why: Core momentum/trend signal. Crossovers around zero and the histogram give a sense of momentum strength and potential trend inflection.
- macdh
  Why: MACD histogram—momentum strength. Useful for spotting divergences between price and momentum that may precede reversals.
- rsi
  Why: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold signals. Divergence with price can provide early reversal clues; be mindful in strong ETFs where RSI can stay extended.
- boll
  Why: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA) provides a dynamic mean reversion baseline. Used with bands to assess breakout/mean-reversion potential and volatility context.
- atr
  Why: Volatility gauge to calibrate risk management (stop placement, position sizing). Helps adjust expectations during volatile periods.

How to interpret these together (without data here)
- Trend confirmation
  - Price above 200 sma and 50 sma trending upward supports a bullish regime; price below these with downward slope supports a bearish regime. Use 10 ema as a quick signal of momentum shifts within that regime.
- Momentum signals
  - macd crossing above its signal line and rising toward positive territory supports a bullish setup; macdh that is increasing confirms strengthening momentum. RSI above 50 with rising slope reinforces bullish momentum, while RSI under 50 with a downward slope supports bearish momentum.
- Volatility and risk controls
  - ATR rising indicates expanding volatility; consider widening stop losses and adjusting position size. Boll middle (boll) around price helps gauge whether price is riding a moving baseline or diverging toward the bands, suggesting breakouts or mean-reversion zones.

Actionable rule set (illustrative, not financial advice)
- Trend filter: Enter long when price is above 200 sma, 50 sma is rising, and 10 ema is above price but showing a recent pullback (potential dip entry). Use macd positive and increasing, macdh increasing, RSI above 50 but not in overbought extremes.
- Trend filter: Enter short when price is below 200 sma, 50 sma descending, and 10 ema is below price with a recent bounce (potential short entry). Use macd negative and decreasing, macdh decreasing, RSI below 50.
- Breakout context: When boll middle is aligned with a tight price range and ATR is rising, look for a breakout above the upper Bollinger band with macd/macdh confirming momentum and RSI moving toward overbought but not extreme.
- Reversion context: If price near boll_lb, ATR is moderate, macd/macd history showing weakening momentum, and RSI turning from overbought/oversold levels toward the middle, consider a mean-reversion setup with a tight stop.

Next steps to get precise, chart-specific insights
- Please retry data retrieval (get_YFin_data) for QQQ with the same date range, or provide the downloaded data you receive. Once I have the data, I will:
  - Compute the eight indicators above.
  - Provide a detailed, fine-grained trend report (timeframe-specific if you specify: daily, 4h, etc.).
  - Highlight confirmatory signals, divergences, and potential false positives.
  - Append a concise Markdown table summarizing key points, watchouts, and proposed actions.

Proposed Markdown table (structure to fill with precise outputs after data load)
- Indicator | What it tells you | How to use it in an order flow
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Use as a trigger within the longer trend context
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction | Confirm trend before entry
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend regime | Core directional bias
- macd | Momentum and trend strength | Crossings and zero-line movement
- macdh | Momentum strength via histogram | Divergences and momentum confirmation
- rsi | Overbought/oversold momentum | Watch for reversals or continuations
- boll | Mean reversion baseline | Breakout vs. reversion context
- atr | Volatility and risk sizing | Adjust stops/position sizes

Note on data access
- The current environment returned a FileNotFoundError when calling get_YFin_data for QQQ. If you can retry or provide the data externally, I’ll deliver the full, data-driven analysis with precise trend details and a clean, trader-ready report (including the requested Markdown table).

If you want me to retry fetching the data now, I can attempt again and proceed with a data-driven interpretation as soon as the data comes through.
