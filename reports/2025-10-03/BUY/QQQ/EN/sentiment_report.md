Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit stock news for QQQ on 2025-10-03, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the Reddit data tool backend is down or misconfigured right now. I can either retry shortly or switch to alternative data sources (other social platforms, general news wires, ETF-focused sentiment data) to keep moving.

If you’d like, I can proceed right away with a qualitative, multi-source analysis using available sources besides Reddit and deliver a comprehensive report with a Markdown table at the end. A couple of notes before I proceed:

Important context
- QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) that tracks the NASDAQ-100. Sentiment and news around QQQ often reflect broader tech/innovation sector themes, mega-cap NASDAQ constituents, and macro tech-driven flows rather than sentiment on a single company.
- For traders, key signals will come from: daily sentiment shifts in tech/e-commerce/AI discourse, ETF-level news catalysts (policy, rate expectations, tech earnings environment), and the relationship between sentiment and intraday price/volume/options activity.

What I propose to deliver (if you approve proceeding now)
1) Daily sentiment and News Synthesis (past 7 days, non-Reddit sources)
   - Aggregate sentiment cues from major news outlets, social chatter (X/Twitter, public forums other than Reddit, major financial blogs), and ETF commentary.
   - Highlight top themes by day (e.g., AI hype, rate-hike expectations, semiconductor/mega-cap results, geopolitical risk impacts).

2) Catalyst Deep-Dive
   - Identify any notable news catalysts that could move QQQ (Earnings from NASDAQ-100 members, policy shifts, macro data releases, sector rotations).

3) Price Action and Context
   - Summarize recent price/volume action in QQQ and how sentiment/themes may have correlated.
   - Note any divergences between sentiment signals and price action.

4) Flow / Options Signals (if data available)
   - Look for unusual options activity, skew, or fund/ETF flow indicators that align with or contradict sentiment.

5) Trading Implications and Risk
   - Short- to intermediate-term implications for QQQ based on collected signals.
   - Key risks to monitor (tech sector momentum, rate expectations, geopolitical developments, macro liquidity changes).

6) Append a Markdown Table
   - A structured table at the end with key points for quick review (Date, Source/Theme, Sentiment Tilt, News Catalyst, Price/Action, Implication).

Before I proceed, please confirm:
- Do you want me to proceed with the qualitative, multi-source analysis now (using sources other than Reddit as the primary input)?
- Any preferred sources to emphasize (e.g., X, major financial news outlets, ETF-focused newsletters, Yahoo Finance/MarketWatch headlines, Bloomberg/Reuters feed)?
- If you specifically want Reddit data included, I can retry the Reddit data tool as soon as it comes back online and merge it with the other sources.

Once you confirm, I’ll deliver a full report with detailed insights and the Markdown table at the end.
