I ran into a data fetch issue pulling Yahoo Finance data for GOOGL. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the actual price history to compute the indicators right now. I can retry immediately, or you can specify a alternative data window or source. In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan and the most relevant indicator set I would use for GOOGL, along with how I’d interpret them once the data is available.

Selected indicators (up to 8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll

Why these indicators are suitable for GOOGL on a broad, current-market backdrop
- close_50_sma: Captures the medium-term trend; helps verify whether price is trading above or below a common trend baseline. Useful for dynamic support/resistance in a stock with frequent AI/tech-driven news catalysts.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend anchor; helps identify secular health of the stock (bullish/bearish regime) and potential golden/death cross signals when combined with shorter-term moves.
- close_10_ema: Fast-moving average to sense near-term momentum shifts and potential entries/exits; complements the slower SMAs to filter noise.
- macd: Core momentum/trend-change signal. Crosses around zero and convergence/divergence provide early indications of shifts in the underlying trend.
- macds: Signal line for MACD; helps confirm MACD-derived signals and reduces false entries when used with MACD.
- macdh: MACD histogram; shows momentum strength and potential divergence naked-eye cues; useful for spotting momentum weakening or strengthening ahead of price moves.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold extremes and potential reversals; also useful for divergence when price action diverges from RSI.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA) as a dynamic price benchmark; helps contextualize price relative to a volatility-adjusted baseline and pairs with bands to spot breakouts/reversals (even though you didn’t ask for upper/lower bands here, the middle line is a strong baseline).

How I’ll interpret the signals (when I have the data)
- Trend confirmation and regime: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to determine if the stock is in a shorter- vs longer-term uptrend. Look for alignment (price above both, or price below both). Watch for crossovers where the 50 SMA crosses the 200 SMA as potential regime signals.
- Short-term momentum: Use close_10_ema, MACD (macd), and MACD histogram (macdh) to gauge near-term momentum and possible entry/exit timing. Positive MACD crossovers with price above the 50/200 SMAs strengthen long-side bias; negative crossovers or momentum fading suggests caution.
- Momentum strength and potential reversals: RSI (rsi) will indicate overbought/oversold levels and potential divergences with price. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay rich (>70) for extended periods; in such cases, rely more on trend and MACD confirmations.
- Volatility context and range dynamics: Boll (middle line) provides a dynamic price baseline to compare current price actions against. In a high-volatility regime, price may swing around this line with frequent touches to bands (which could be explored later if you want to add boll_ub/boll_lb).
- Signal confirmation: Favor trades that align across multiple indicators. For example, price above both SMAs, MACD above signal, MACD histogram positive, RSI not in extreme overbought, and price above Boll middle—all together would strengthen a bullish bias. The opposite alignment would strengthen a bearish bias.

What to expect once data is retrieved
- I’ll compute the eight indicators for the requested window (and explain the latest readings with interpreted signals).
- I’ll provide a granular, nuanced narrative about the recent price action, including regime shifts, momentum momentum changes, potential pullbacks, and breakout contexts.
- I’ll present a concise decision framework: how to use these indicators together to decide on entries, exits, or avoidance.

Next steps
- I can retry pulling the data now. If you’d like, I’ll attempt again immediately and then deliver the full, detailed indicator report with the latest readings for GOOGL.
- Alternatively, you can allow me to use a different date range or data source if you have a preference.

Proposed quick-reference summary (table)
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  How to use: Price above/below to gauge trend; use with faster indicators for entries
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  What it measures: Long-term trend baseline
  How to use: Confirm secular trend; watch for potential golden/death cross with shorter averages
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  What it measures: Quick momentum shifts
  How to use: Identify recent momentum changes; filter with longer-term trends
- Indicator: macd
  What it measures: Momentum differences via EMA crossovers
  How to use: Crossovers signal trend changes; confirm with other indicators
- Indicator: macds
  What it measures: MACD signal line
  How to use: Cross with MACD line to trigger signals; adds robustness against false positives
- Indicator: macdh
  What it measures: MACD histogram momentum strength
  How to use: Divergence and momentum strength indicators; complements MACD
- Indicator: rsi
  What it measures: Momentum, overbought/oversold
  How to use: Thresholds (e.g., 70/30); watch for divergences; validate with trend
- Indicator: boll
  What it measures: Bollinger Middle baseline (20 SMA)
  How to use: Baseline for price action; context for breakouts/reversals when combined with bands

Please tell me if you want me to retry pulling the data now, or specify an alternative data source/window and I’ll proceed with the full indicator setup and a detailed trend analysis for GOOGL.
