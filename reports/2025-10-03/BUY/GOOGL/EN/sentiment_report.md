I ran into an internal tool error fetching Reddit data for GOOGL on 2025-10-03 (FileNotFoundError). I can retry, or we can proceed with a comprehensive analysis using other sources (news, general sentiment on other platforms) and then fill in Reddit-specific sentiment once the tool is available again.

Please choose one of the following:
- Retry Reddit data fetch now (I’ll attempt again immediately)
- Proceed with a full report using other sources (news headlines, public sentiment from non-Reddit platforms, earnings/regulatory/news items) and clearly note Reddit data is unavailable at the moment
- Wait and retry later

In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the long report once we have data, and I can begin drafting now with placeholders for Reddit sentiment:

Proposed report structure (GOOGL)
- Executive snapshot
  - High-level sentiment stance (bullish/bearish/mixed) from social/media and news
  - Key catalysts and risks for the next 1–3 weeks
- Social media sentiment analysis
  - Daily sentiment deltas (last 7–14 days) from Reddit and other major platforms
  - Topic themes (AI advances, ad-market health, cloud growth, regulatory risk, stock buyback/news)
  - Notable influencers or recurring narratives driving sentiment
- News and event analysis
  - Summary of recent company announcements (product updates, AI initiatives, cloud/YouTube ads, regulatory issues)
  - Analyst note signals and market reaction
  - Any notable earnings/financial news context relevant to sentiment
- Competitive and macro context
  - Ad market trajectory, AI competitor landscape, cloud competition
  - Regulatory/regulatory risk environment affecting Alphabet
- Sentiment-to-price implications
  - Short-term tactical read (intraday to 5–10 days) based on sentiment spikes or reversals
  - Probability-weighted scenarios (bullish/bearish/base) with trigger levels
- Risks and caveats
  - Data limitations, potential sentiment biases, earnings risk
- Actionable takeaways for traders
  - If sentiment strengthens: potential setup ideas
  - If sentiment weakens: risk management notes
  - Key levels to watch (support/resistance derived from price-action and event risk)

MakrMarkdown table (to be filled after data collection)
- A concise table summarizing: date, source, sentiment score, key themes, notable headlines, implied action

If you’d like, I can:
- Start drafting the full report now with a clear emphasis on what we can deduce from non-Reddit sources and mark Reddit-specific points as "pending" until the data fetch succeeds.
- Or retry the Reddit data fetch first and then generate the complete, final report with Reddit sentiment included.

How would you like to proceed?
