I ran into a data retrieval issue trying to fetch SPY data. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data pull, or proceed with a data-less, framework-based analysis you can use immediately. Which would you prefer? If you’d like, I’ll retry now and then provide a data-driven, refreshable reading.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators for SPY (up to 8) that provide diverse, complementary insights for a typical ETF tracking the S&P 500. The goal is to balance trend, momentum, volatility, and volume signals without redundancy.

Selected indicators for SPY (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- vwma
- atr

Rationale for each indicator
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average): Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for identifying the prevailing trend and filtering signals from faster oscillators.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average): Long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm major regime shifts (golden/death cross tendencies) and adds strategic context to entries/exits.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average): Responsive short-term momentum gauge. Captures quick shifts in price action and can hint at early entries when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd (MACD line): Momentum indicator showing differences between fast and slow EMAs. Crossovers signal potential trend changes; useful in confirming trend direction when aligned with price action.
- macds (MACD Signal): The smoothing of the MACD line. Using MACD crossovers with MACD can help filter false signals and time entries more reliably.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold extremes and divergences. Complements trend indicators—helps identify potential reversal/mean-reversion points when used with trend context.
- vwma (VWMA): Volume-weighted moving average. Confirms price moves with volume, helping to validate breakouts or pullbacks in the direction of the trend. Reduces noise from price-only moves.
- atr (ATR): Measures volatility to inform risk management, position sizing, and stop placement. Useful for adjusting expectations during changing vol environments and for trailing stops.

Nuanced interpretation framework (without current data)
- Bullish cues (illustrative, not contingent on current values)
  - Price trades above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma, with close_10_ema above the price or leading the way, suggesting a stronger uptrend.
  - macd > macds with a rising histogram, and RSI above 50 but not in extreme overbought territory (e.g., 50–70 range).
  - VWMA rising and above or near price, indicating volume-supported momentum.
  - ATR trending higher during a breakout, signaling genuine volatility expansion and reducing risk of false breakouts.
- Neutral/transition cues
  - Price tests 50SMA/200SMA with tight ranges, MACD and MACD Signal overlapping, RSI around 50–60, VWMA in step with price, and ATR holding steady.
  - Possible consolidation or a basing pattern; wait for a breakout confirmed by MACD cross and a sustained move above/below the moving averages.
- Bearish cues
  - Price below 50SMA and 200SMA, with 10EMA failing to stay above price, suggesting a downtrend.
  - MACD crossing below MACD Signal with a negative histogram, RSI rolling toward 30–40, and VWMA weakening while price slides.
  - ATR rising on downside moves can indicate acceleration in volatility; cautious risk management required with tighter stops.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval now to generate a data-driven, timestamped read on SPY using these indicators, then provide a structured trend report with observed values, cross-checks, and actionable insights.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with the qualitative framework above and include a practical set of entry/exit ideas tied to the selected indicators, clearly marking where signals align or diverge.
