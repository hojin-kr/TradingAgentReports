Apologies—the Reddit data tool for SPY returned a FileNotFoundError on both attempts. I can’t fetch Reddit-based sentiment data right now.

Would you like me to proceed in one of these ways?
- Option A: Deliver a thorough SPY analysis using non-Reddit sources (macro news, headlines, general social sentiment proxies, and public market data) to produce a trader-focused long report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: Retry the Reddit data fetch later or as soon as the tool becomes available.
- Option C: If you have alternative data you want me to use (e.g., a dataset or other social platforms), provide it and I’ll analyze it.

If you choose Option A, I’ll produce a comprehensive report that includes:
- Executive summary: current sentiment mood for SPY, key drivers, and potential traps.
- Social sentiment proxy analysis (non-Reddit): themes likely to have influenced SPY over the past week (e.g., macro headlines, policy expectations, geopolitical factors, earnings noise).
- News and event synthesis: notable headlines and catalysts from the last week that would impact SPY (macro data, Federal Reserve rhetoric, earnings guidance, inflation signals).
- Market mechanics: ETF flows, options activity hints, VIX behavior, sector rotation context, and liquidity considerations.
- Day-by-day sentiment scaffolding: a granular look at what usually moves SPY in a week with generic descriptors (e.g., "early-week risk-on tone", "mid-week rotation into defensives", "late-week volatility").
- Trading implications and scenarios: what to watch for (breakouts vs. breakdowns, support/resistance levels to monitor, risk controls, and hedging considerations).
- Key risk factors: leveraged positioning risk, macro surprises, policy surprises, and volatility spikes.
- Markdown table: a concise, readable summary of the above points.

If you want me to proceed now with Option A, I’ll start and deliver the full report plus the Markdown table at the end.
