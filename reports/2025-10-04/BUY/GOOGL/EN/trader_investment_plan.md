Verdict: Buy with a disciplined, hedged, staged entry.

Rationale at a glance
- Alphabet’s diversified growth: AI-enabled features across Search, YouTube, Android, and Cloud create multiple engines of growth, reducing single-point risk.
- AI monetization optionality: Potential for higher engagement, better ad effectiveness, and stronger enterprise AI adoption, which could lift revenue mix and margins over time.
- Balance sheet and capital returns: Strong cash generation, buybacks, and resilience against near-term headwinds support a favorable long-run risk/reward.
- Managed risk approach: The plan emphasizes hedging and staged entry to participate in upside while limiting downside should near-term headwinds intensify.

Concrete trading plan (two-stage entry with hedging)
1) Stage 1 entry (today)
- Position size: Deploy 25–40% of your planned Alphabet exposure to avoid chasing rallies and to leave room for a pullback.
- Entry method: Use a limit order near current price with a small buffer (within a few percent) to avoid slippage.
- Hedge (collar setup, 6–12 month horizon):
  - Long put (protective): Buy an out-of-the-money put with a strike about 10–15% below current price.
  - Short call (funding): Sell a slightly OTM call to partially finance the put cost, strike close to or just above current price.
  - Rationale: Caps downside while preserving upside, with a roughly neutral cost net of premium.
2) Stage 2 entry (on strength or pullbacks, 4–8 weeks)
- Conditions to add: 
  - Data-driven signs that AI monetization is translating into revenue/margin uplift (ads efficiency, Cloud ARR growth, or margin stabilization).
  - Strength in technicals (positive momentum, clear breakout signals, or tests of key supports like the 50/200-day averages with favorable volume).
- Additional deployment: Add the remaining 60–75% of the target exposure, prioritizing pullbacks toward support zones or confirmed strength.
3) Interim validation and metrics to watch
- AI monetization signals: incremental ARPU uplift, higher ad effectiveness, or meaningful Cloud margin improvement.
- Cloud trajectory: Operating leverage and margin stabilization, even if gradual.
- Regulatory and macro headlines: No fresh, material headwinds undermining the thesis.
- Technical confirmation: Favorable momentum indicators (e.g., MACD alignment, RSI in supportive zone) before further sizing.
4) Risk controls and exit plan
- Stop/guardrail: If Alphabet trades through a defined key support level with conviction (personalized to your risk tolerance), reassess or trim exposure.
- Hedge adjustments: If vol shifts, consider widening or tightening the collar (adjust put/call strikes or expiries) to maintain downside protection while preserving upside.
- Exit triggers: Predefine a scenario-based exit if AI monetization fails to show confirmable progress over multiple quarters or if regulatory risk escalates beyond a tolerable level.
5) Data-driven validation framework (when data is available)
- Use a multi-factor read (technical indicators plus fundamental/operational datapoints) to time additions and hedge adjustments.
- Specifically monitor: AI monetization progress, cloud ARR/margin trajectory, ad market dynamics, and any regulatory developments.

Notes
- This approach adheres to a balanced stance: participate in upside from Alphabet’s multi-engine growth and AI monetization potential, while employing hedging and staged entry to limit downside risk.
- If you’d like, I can tailor exact quantities, explicit strike choices for the collar, and precise entry/exit price levels to fit your portfolio size and risk tolerance.
