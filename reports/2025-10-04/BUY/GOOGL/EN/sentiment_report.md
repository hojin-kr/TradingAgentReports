Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock news for GOOGL on 2025-10-04, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError in this session. It looks like the data retrieval endpoint isn’t accessible right now. I can either retry shortly, or proceed with an alternative plan to keep you moving.

Options to proceed
- Retry now or after a short delay to try to pull Reddit/social data again.
- Build the full long-form analysis framework using other sources (if you have access to news feeds, tweets, or press releases you can share them and I’ll analyze them).
- Proceed with a detailed framework and a placeholder report until the Reddit tool is functional again.

In the meantime, here is a thorough framework and a ready-to-fill template report for GOOGL that you can review. It’s designed to be filled with data as soon as the Reddit tool or other data sources are available.

 GO O G L — Social Media Sentiment & News Analysis Framework (Draft)

1) Executive Snapshot (current state)

Next steps
- If you want me to proceed with concrete analysis now, I can:
  - Retry pulling Reddit data for GOOGL (and/or other sources if you provide access).
  - Or begin populating this framework with qualitative notes once you share non-Reddit data (e.g., headlines, summaries, or tweets).
- Alternatively, I can keep this ready and automatically fill it as soon as the Reddit tool returns results or you provide data.

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch for GOOGL now, or
- Proceed with this framework and you can supply alternate data sources, or
- Move ahead with a more detailed qualitative write-up based on typical drivers for Alphabet (without the live data)?
