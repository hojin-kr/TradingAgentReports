Decision: Buy NVDA with a disciplined, staged-entry approach and protective hedges.

Rationale (brief):
- Core thesis remains intact: secular AI infrastructure tailwinds support multi-year demand for data-center GPUs and the CUDA software moat, with broadening exposure across gaming, enterprise, and automotive/robotics.
- Valuation and regulatory risks exist, but they can be mitigated through a staged entry and hedging while preserving upside participation.
- The plan’s risk controls (trailing stops, defined drawdown limits, hedges) align with prudent capital management and reduce the chance of a sharp downside surprise.

Execution blueprint (concise):
- Target core exposure: 2%–4% of portfolio value to NVDA.
- Staged entry:
  - Stage 1: Buy ~1/3 of the intended core position today.
  - Stage 2: Add ~1/3 on a mild pullback or after price tests reasonable support within 2–6 weeks.
  - Stage 3: Complete with ~1/3 on positive momentum/beat or favorable guidance.
- Hedging to protect downside:
  - Implement long-dated OTM puts (10%–20% below current price) for a floor, or use a collar (long put + short higher-strike call) to reduce net cost.
  - Consider a short-dated put around catalysts and roll forward as needed.
- Risk controls:
  - Establish a maximum drawdown limit for the NVDA tranche and employ trailing stops or price-target-based trims if momentum deteriorates.
  - Regularly reassess macro/regulatory catalysts and adjust hedges and exposure accordingly.
- Catalysts to monitor:
  - AI capex commentary from hyperscalers/enterprises, major partnerships, regulatory developments, and earnings/margin signals.
- Review cadence:
  - Weekly price/momentum checks; monthly deep-dive on earnings quality, margins, and cash flow.

Bottom line: Buy with a hedged, staged-entry approach to capture the secular AI capex cycle while protecting downside risk.
