Thanks for the prompt. Quick status update: I attempted to fetch the latest NVDA Reddit sentiment data for the requested dates (2025-09-28 through 2025-10-04) using the provided tool, but the Reddit data fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError and failed to deliver any results. I can’t compose the full sentiment-driven report yet without those data points. I can proceed in two ways:

- Option A (preferred): Retry the Reddit data pull now and, once it succeeds, deliver the full, trader-focused NVDA report with day-by-day sentiment, key posts, integration with recent news, and actionable implications.
- Option B: If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis based on general NVDA sentiment signals and publicly known news/tendencies from the past week, while we wait for or retry the Reddit data.

If you’re ready, I’ll retry the data fetch now. If you’d rather proceed immediately with a structured report outline, here it is:

Proposed structure for the NVDA long-form report (trader-focused)

1) Executive snapshot
- One-minute read: current price context, trend, and a quick sentiment tilt (e.g., modest bullishness with risk-off caveats).
- Key catalysts in the last week: any earnings notes, product updates, supply/demand signals, or regulatory headlines.

2) Daily sentiment digest (Reddit-focused)
- Objective: quantify daily Reddit sentiment around NVDA over the past 7 days.
- Output (once data is available): sentiment score per day, notable high-impact posts (institutional chatter, retail consensus shifts), and any recurring themes (AI cycle skepticism, data-center demand, supply chain chatter, toy/consumer GPU chatter, etc.).
- How to use: combine with price action to gauge whether sentiment led or lagged price moves, and spot potential turning points.

3) News and event context (past 7–10 days)
- Summary of major NVDA-related headlines and their potential impact:
  - Product/technology milestones (e.g., new GPU architectures, software/SDK updates, benchmarking chatter).
  - Data-center and AI demand signals (customers’ capex cycles, cloud provider commentary).
  - Supply chain and manufacturing notes (yield, capacity constraints, fab ramp news).
  - Regulatory or macro-related items (export controls, geopolitical risk, macro demand trends).
- Market reaction: intraday moves on headlines, volume spikes, and options activity tilt around key headlines.

4) Price action and technical framing
- Short-term price trend (daily/weekly) and volatility regime.
- Key levels to watch (support/resistance, moving averages, trendlines).
- Options flow context (if available later): skew shifts, max-pain considerations around catalysts.

5) Sentiment-to-price implications for traders
- Short-term (0–2 weeks): sentiment vs. price momentum alignment, risk-on/off cues, and likely catalysts.
- Medium-term (2–6 weeks): AI-cycle positioning vs. inventory/AI capex cadence, potential mispricings around growth expectations.
- Trading ideas: strike-zone ranges, risk controls (stop levels, position sizing), and scenario analysis (bullish, neutral, bearish).

6) Risks and caveats
- Data quality concerns with social sentiment signals.
- Susceptibility to external shocks: macro shifts, rival GPU announcements, regulatory changes.

7) Makrdown summary table (key points)
- A concise, decision-ready table that distills sentiment, catalysts, price context, and actionable takeaways.

8) Appendices (data sources, methodology)
- Data sources (Reddit, headlines, price data, etc.).
- Sentiment scoring methodology and any normalization notes.

Would you like me to proceed with Option A (retry the Reddit data now) to produce the full, data-backed report, or would you prefer Option B (a best-effort qualitative analysis now, with the Reddit data to be appended once available)?

If you want me to proceed with the best quick-path right away (Option B), here is a provisional, data-light outline with placeholders you can expect to be filled once Reddit data returns:

- Daily sentiment digest (to be filled with actual scores and notable posts)
  - 2025-09-28: sentiment = TBD, notable themes = TBD
  - 2025-09-29: sentiment = TBD, notable themes = TBD
  - 2025-09-30: sentiment = TBD, notable themes = TBD
  - 2025-10-01: sentiment = TBD, notable themes = TBD
  - 2025-10-02: sentiment = TBD, notable themes = TBD
  - 2025-10-03: sentiment = TBD, notable themes = TBD
  - 2025-10-04: sentiment = TBD, notable themes = TBD

Appendix: Makrdown table (structure will be populated)

Makrdown table (structure; data to be filled after data pull)
- Section: Daily Signals
  - Date | Reddit Sentiment | Notable Posts/Threads | Context vs. Price | Implied Trader Takeaway
- Section: News Flow
  - Date | Headline | CAT (Catalyst) | Market Reaction | Short-term Implication
- Section: Price & Momentum
  - Date | Price | Change | Volume | Key Levels
- Section: Sentiment-to-Trade Signals
  - Catalyst | Signal (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral) | Suggested Action | Rationale

Next steps
- Please confirm which option you prefer:
  1) Retry and deliver Option A (full data-backed report once Reddit data comes in).
 2) Proceed with Option B now (qualitative analysis with a placeholder for Reddit data to be added later).
- If you have any other data sources you want included (e.g., notable headlines beyond Reddit, or specific timeframes), tell me and I’ll incorporate them.

I’m ready to retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as you confirm Option A, and I can push a full, trader-focused NVDA report with a detailed Makrdown table at the end.
