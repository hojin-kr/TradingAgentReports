I ran into a data retrieval error when trying to fetch NVDA data from Yahoo Finance (FileNotFoundError). The indicator calculations can’t be generated without the price history. I can retry fetching the data now or as soon as the data service is available again. In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of indicators and a detailed framework for NVDA, tailored to a typical NVDA-style setup in a market environment like late 2025. This will help you get ready to act as soon as the data import succeeds.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale for NVDA
1) close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
- Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Use for NVDA: Look for price trading above 50-SMA with a positive slope as a confirmation of bullish intermediate trend. A pullback to or bounce from 50-SMA can offer potential entry points in an uptrend.

2) close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
- Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death cross context).
- Use for NVDA: If price sits above 200-SMA with both 50-SMA and 200-SMA aligned (50 above 200), that supports a sustained uptrend thesis. Crosses of 50/200 can signal longer-term trend changes and should be watched for confirmation with other momentum signals.

3) close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
- Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum and potential quick entry/exit signals.
- Use for NVDA: A short-term bullish bias is suggested when price is above the 10-EMA and the 10-EMA is above the 50-SMA. A cross of price below the 10-EMA can be a fast warning of a momentum shift in the near term.

4) macd (MACD line)
- Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals via the difference between short and longer EMAs.
- Use for NVDA: Look for MACD line crossing above the signal (macds) as a bullish signal, especially when price is above major moving averages. In parallel markets, consider MACD direction and the position relative to zero.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- Purpose: Smoothing of MACD to generate crossovers; more reliable trigger than MACD alone.
- Use for NVDA: A bullish setup occurs when macd crosses above macds; a bearish setup when macd crosses below macds. Combine with price position relative to 50/200 SMA for better filter.

6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
- Purpose: Momentum strength; divergence/expansion visual cue.
- Use for NVDA: Positive and expanding histogram supports bullish momentum; a shrinking or negative histogram warns of weakening momentum even if MACD lines are still above zero. Divergence with price is a potential reversal warning.

7) rsi (RSI)
- Purpose: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions.
- Use for NVDA: In uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; use RSI in conjunction with trend (price above 50/200 SMA) to avoid false reversals. Look for bullish breakouts when RSI climbs from mid-range rather than mere micro overbought readings.

8) boll (Bollinger Middle)
- Purpose: Baseline benchmark around a 20-SMA and the context for volatility via bands.
- Use for NVDA: Price trading above the Bollinger Middle (20-SMA) with widening bands can indicate a strong upmove; pullbacks to the middle line can act as support during uptrends. Consider breakouts or rejections relative to the upper/lower bands in conjunction with momentum signals.

What you’d look for in a completed data run (how the signals would play together)
- Trend confirmation: Price above 50-SMA and 200-SMA, with 50-SMA above 200-SMA. This alignment supports a bullish bias.
- Momentum alignment: MACD line above MACD signal, MACD histogram positive and rising, and RSI trending higher but not necessarily at extreme overbought levels—watch for divergences against price to flag potential reversals.
- Short-term entries: If price stays above the 10-EMA and the 10-EMA remains above the 50-SMA, a pullback toward the 10-EMA or the 50-SMA can offer low-risk entry points, provided MACD/momentum remains constructive.
- Volatility context: Bollinger Middle above price and bands tightening/expanding in line with price action—expanding bands + price advancing toward upper band can imply sustained momentum; price contractions near the middle can signal consolidation.
- Risk management: Use ATR to gauge volatility for stop placement and sizing (e.g., larger ATR implies wider stops; smaller ATR allows tighter stops). VWMA can be considered as a supplementary check for volume-driven moves (not in the 8 chosen here, but useful to observe if you add more tools).

Next steps
- I will retry fetching the NVDA data and calculating these indicators as soon as the data service is available again. Please let me know if you’d prefer me to:
  - Retry immediately, or
  - Schedule a retry for a specific time, or
  - Switch to a different date range or data source (if you have a preference).

Appendix: Indicator Summary Table
| Indicator | Category | What it Measures / Signals | How to Interpret for NVDA | Practical Notes |
|---------|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50-SMA with upward slope = bullish trend confirmation; pullbacks to 50-SMA = potential buys if momentum supports | Lagging indicator; use with faster filters |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200-SMA with 50-SMA above 200-SMA = favorable macro trend; watch for golden cross (50 crossing above 200) as trend confirmation | Slow to react; good for strategic framing |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price above 10-EMA and 10-EMA above 50-SMA = near-term bullish bias; cross below can warn of quick reversals | Sensitive to noise; use with broader trend filters |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum/trend-change signals via MACD line | Bullish when MACD line crosses above MACD Signal; confirm with price above major SMAs | Works well in steady markets; corroborate with RSI/volume |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line crossovers | Buy when MACD crosses MACD Signal; sell when MACD crosses below | Provides smoother trigger than MACD alone |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength via histogram | Positive, expanding histogram supports momentum; diverging histogram vs price warns of potential reversal | Divergence insights; watch for histogram cambio with price action |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | Rising RSI confirms momentum; extreme readings (>70) require trend context to avoid false signals | Use with trend filters to avoid misreads in strong uptrends |
| boll | Volatility/Benchmark | Baseline middle line (20-SMA) and context for price vs volatility | Price above Boll Middle with bands expanding or price near upper band supports bullish stance; pullbacks to middle line may present entries | Use with price action relative to bands for breakout/reversal cues |

Status note
- The data import step is currently blocked by a backend error. I’m ready to retry as soon as access is restored. If you want, I can attempt another fetch now or on a schedule you specify.

No FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL yet. Once we have the data, I can present a concrete, data-supported trade view (BUY/HOLD/SELL) based on the 8-indicator framework above.
