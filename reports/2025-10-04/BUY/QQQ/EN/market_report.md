I’m running into a data-fetch issue on the Yahoo Finance data tool right now:

- The get_YFin_data call returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like a backend data source hiccup rather than an issue with your request.

I can either:
- Retry fetching QQQ data now, or
- Proceed with a best-effort indicator framework and wait for the data to come back online to generate a live, data-driven report.

In the meantime, here is a focused, non-redundant set of indicators I would use for QQQ (8 indicators total) along with why they’re suitable for a tech-heavy, Nasdaq-100 context. Once data retrieval succeeds, I’ll run the actual calculations and provide a detailed, data-backed narrative.

Selected indicators (with rationale)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the prevailing trend alongside faster signals.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark and confirmation (golden/death cross insights). Useful for macro-trend context and risk framing.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts and potential entries when aligned with longer-term trend.
- macd: Core momentum signal via MACD line vs. signal line crossovers; also useful for divergence in conjunction with price action.
- macds: MACD Signal line; crossovers with MACD provide actionable timing signals when filtered by other indicators.
- macdh: MACD Histogram; visualizes momentum strength and potential early divergences, helpful in fading false signals in choppier markets.
- rsi: Momentum strength/overbought-oversold indicator; good for spotting reversals when used with trend filters.
- atr: Volatility gauge to size risk and adapt stops; complements trend/momentum signals with volatility context.

How I’ll interpret signals (once data is available)
- Trend framing: Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA signals a bullish backdrop; price below both indicates bearish pressure. Crossovers (50SMA crossing above/below 200SMA) provide additional trend confirmation or warning.
- Momentum timing: MACD and MACD-Histogram help identify shifts in momentum; look for MACD line crossing above/below the signal line to time entries when price aligns with the established trend.
- Short-term momentum and potential reversals: 10_EMA relative to price and the RSI level (e.g., RSI moving away from extremes or showing bearish/bullish divergence with price) can hint at entries or exits when corroborated by MACD trend.
- Volatility/risk control: ATR-based stop placement and position-sizing adjustments to reflect current volatility; higher ATR suggests wider stops but potentially larger targets; lower ATR suggests tighter stops and higher precision.

What I’ll deliver when data is back online
- A detailed, data-driven narrative describing: trend direction, momentum strength, volatility regime, and potential entry/exit signals for QQQ over the chosen lookback window.
- A concise, decision-ready set of trade considerations (entry/exit/stop ideas) grounded in the eight indicators above.
- A markdown table (as requested) summarizing key insights and signals.

Markdown table: Key indicators, roles, and what to watch for (to be filled with live data)

- Indicator: close_50_sma
  Role: Trend direction / dynamic support-resistance
  Signal cues: Price above/below; 50SMA cross with price; alignment with 200SMA
  Trade implication: Use as trend filter; enter on pullback/strength in line with trend

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  Role: Long-term trend benchmark
  Signal cues: Price crossing 200SMA; golden/death cross with 50SMA
  Trade implication: Higher-confidence trend context; prefer trend-aligned entries

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  Role: Short-term momentum
  Signal cues: Price crossing/holding around 10EMA; confluence with other signals
  Trade implication: Timely entries/exits within larger trend

- Indicator: macd
  Role: Momentum shift indicator
  Signal cues: MACD line crossing MACD signal; divergences with price
  Trade implication: Add timing to trend signals; corroborate with RSI/price

- Indicator: macds
  Role: MACD signal smoothing
  Signal cues: Crossovers with MACD line
  Trade implication: Filter false MACD cross signals

- Indicator: macdh
  Role: Momentum strength visualization
  Signal cues: Histogram expansion/contraction; divergence
  Trade implication: Early strength/weakness read; use with other signals

- Indicator: rsi
  Role: Overbought/oversold and momentum checks
  Signal cues: RSI extremes, trend-aligned divergence
  Trade implication: Watch for reversals or strength confirmation; avoid overreliance in strong trends

- Indicator: atr
  Role: Volatility and risk management
  Signal cues: Rising/falling ATR; relative stop size guidance
  Trade implication: Position sizing and stop placement adjustments

Would you like me to retry fetching QQQ data now and then generate the full data-driven report with the eight indicators above? If you prefer, I can proceed with the qualitative indicator framework immediately and produce the live analysis as soon as data is available.
