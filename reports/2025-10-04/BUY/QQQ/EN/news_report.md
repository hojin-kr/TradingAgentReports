Here is a comprehensive weekly macro and QQQ-focused market update, incorporating available data through 2025-10-04. Note: the Finnhub feed and certain data sources (EODHD) were inaccessible in this session, so the synthesis below relies on the latest accessible Google News outputs and general macro/macro-linked signals that are typically relevant for QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) positioning. I flag gaps where applicable and provide actionable signals and scenarios for traders.

Executive summary
- The Nasdaq-100/QQQ landscape remains tilted toward megacap tech exposure (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL). The week’s sentiment hinges on AI-driven demand, tech capex cycles, and macro data that shapes Fed expectations and global liquidity.
- Key macro themes driving QQQ: a cautiously resilient US economy, ongoing moderation in inflation with persistent services-price pressures, a data-dependent Fed stance, and a continuing AI/semis investment cycle that supports high-growth technology earnings.
- What to watch next: fresh macro prints (inflation, labour market, and growth), key tech earnings and guidance (especially the mega-caps with heavy QQQ weight), and policy commentary that could shift risk appetite or implied rate paths.

Global macro context (relevant for QQQ and tech equities)
- Inflation and monetary policy
  - Inflation has generally cooled, but core services inflation remains a focal point for policy expectations. The Fed is likely to stay data-dependent; investors will parse any signs of sticky inflation or disinflation momentum in services.
  - Market sentiment tends to improve on clearer signs of inflation easing and when rate-path outlook stabilizes (lower odds of aggressive hikes; or, conversely, higher odds of faster cuts if disinflation accelerates). Given the macro backdrop, tech earnings and AI investment outlays remain key drivers of growth expectations rather than traditional manufacturing cycles.
- Growth and demand
  - The US consumer and business investment in technology-related capex appears to be holding up, supported by AI adoption, cloud infrastructure expansion, and semiconductor demand cycles. CIO/IT budgets continue to prioritize high-ROI AI/automation applications, which bodes well for a subset of Nasdaq-100 components.
  - Global growth signals (Europe, China) influence tech demand indirectly via supply chains, foreign exchange, and multinational earnings; any acceleration or deceleration there can impact cross-border tech players and semis.
- Financial conditions and market structure
  - Financial conditions (credit spreads, funding liquidity, and risk sentiment) remain a critical driver for a high-duration, growth-focused index like QQQ. Narrow leadership (mega-cap tech) can persist in a risk-on phase, while a more constructive breadth environment would require more participation from other tech subsectors and growth names.
- Geopolitics and regulation
  - Ongoing regulatory scrutiny around big tech and AI applications could modulate risk premia on high-valuation growth names. Any policy shifts on antitrust, data privacy, or export controls could reprice megacap exposure, particularly for GOOGL, MSFT, and NVDA.

QQQ-focused lens: what matters most right now
- Composition and exposure
  - QQQ tracks the Nasdaq-100, with heavy weights in megacap tech. Performance is highly sensitive to the earnings trajectory and guidance of a few mega-cap contributors (primarily AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL). Even small shifts in these names’ revenue mix, margins, or AI-related capex plans can move the ETF meaningfully.
- Earnings backdrop
  - The week’s earnings season (mega-cap tilt) remains a key driver. Positive guidance on AI adoption, cloud growth, and AI-substrate monetization can sustain risk-on appetite; negative surprises or cost pressures could weaken breadth and pressure the index, especially if other sectors do not step in to support.
- Valuation and sentiment
  - Relative valuations for Nasdaq-100-style growth names remain elevated vs. broad markets when AI optimism and cloud earnings are intact. Any signs of cooling AI capex or slower-than-expected cloud growth could compress multiples and trigger rotations toward more cyclic or value-oriented areas.
- Macroe data and rate expectations
  - The primary cross-asset driver remains the path of interest rates and the level of monetary policy uncertainty. If inflation data continues to surprise to the upside, rate expectations firm; if disinflation accelerates, multiple expansion for growth names could resume.

Recent signals (based on available public signals and typical weekly patterns)
- Google News signals indicate macro-forward-looking themes around credit markets, inflation, and policy, alongside broad market commentary. The presence of items like “credit markets look increasingly dangerous” or “macro updates” suggests ongoing concern about liquidity and rate trajectories; however, these themes do not necessarily contradict a risk-on tilt if tech earnings and AI capex momentum stay intact.
- Given the tool access hiccup for Finnhub and EODHD data in this session, I’m treating quantitative signals as lagging or incomplete here. If you can re-enable those feeds, I can integrate precise sentiment and headline counts, cross-asset moves, and event-driven prints.

Trading-relevant insights and scenarios for QQQ
Base case (most likely): AI/tech capex momentum persists, inflation cools gradually, Fed remains data-dependent but non-dovish unless disinflation accelerates. Implications for QQQ:
- Expect continued resilience in megacap tech earnings (especially cloud, AI software, semis subsystems).
- QQQ may gravitate toward a grind higher with intermittent pullbacks on risk-off episodes or if market breadth weakens.
- Key levels to monitor: intraday/short-term resistance around recent highs; near-term support when markets digest macro prints or policy guidance.

Bull case: stronger-than-expected tech earnings, sustained AI adoption, and a clearer path to policy easing.
- Implications: QQQ could hit new multi-week highs; leadership remains concentrated in mega-cap tech. Positive breadth (more names participating) helps mitigate risk of a single-name shock.
- Signals to watch: breadth improving, rising order-book/infra expansion in AI-related sectors, and robust guidance from top-weighted constituents.

Bear case: macro surprise (inflation sticks, growth softness) or a meaningful policy surprise that implies higher-for-longer rates.
- Implications: risk-off spillovers could pull QQQ back, especially if the pattern of breadth deteriorates and volatility rises. High-duration growth valuations become vulnerable if discount rates rise.
- Signals to watch: widening credit spreads, rising implied volatility (VIX) on tech-exposed names, and weaker-than-expected earnings or guidance from mega-cap tech.

Key data/events to monitor next (for QQQ and macro)
- US inflation prints (CPI, PCE) and core components, especially services inflation.
- Labor market data (jobless claims, payrolls, wage growth) and productivity metrics.
- Fed communications (minutes, speeches) for guidance on rate path and balance sheet normalization.
- Mega-cap tech earnings and forward guidance (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL) and AI/cloud capex commentary.
- Global growth signals and semiconductor demand dynamics (supply/demand balance, end-market demand in AI, data centers).

Risks to the view
- Macro regime could shift if geopolitical or regulatory developments create a risk-off environment or alter AI/tech investment incentives.
- If semis and cloud compute demand weaken, breadth in QQQ could deteriorate even if mega-caps hold up.
- Unexpected policy moves (tighter financial conditions, new antitrust/regulatory actions) could compress growth multiples quickly.

What to monitor in the next week
- Any updates to Fed guidance or notable inflation prints that alter rate-path expectations.
- Earnings guidance from mega-cap tech with AI focus (cloud, AI platforms, semis supply chain health).
- Broader market breadth indicators (advance/decline lines, new highs vs. new lows) to gauge participation beyond the top five constituents.

Data gaps and next steps
- Finnhub data feed for QQQ news was unavailable in this session. If you re-run with a working Finnhub API, I will integrate:
  - Headlines and sentiment on QQQ components.
  - Event-driven triggers (earnings surprises, guidance revisions, macro releases).
- EODHD data access was also not available here; I can incorporate EODHD summaries if you provide outputs or enable access in a follow-up.
