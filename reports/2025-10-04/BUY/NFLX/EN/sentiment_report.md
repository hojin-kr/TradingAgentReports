Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch the Reddit/stock-news data for NFLX on 2025-10-04, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (the Reddit stock-info fetcher isn’t currently functioning in this environment). I can’t retrieve the latest social sentiment data right now. Here are two paths we can take to keep moving:

Option A — Proceed with a qualitative, forward-looking analysis
- I’ll draft a comprehensive NFLX sentiment & news analysis based on general market drivers, company fundamentals, and typical streaming industry themes, clearly labeled as qualitative estimates (no hard data pulled from Reddit yet).
- I’ll include a detailed implications section for traders, including potential catalysts to watch this week (subscriber trends, ARPU/ads revenue, content slate performance, international growth, competition, and macro factors).
- At the end, I’ll add a Markdown table summarizing key takeaways, themes, and potential trading implications.

Option B — Pause and retry the data pull
- I can retry the Reddit stock-info tool as soon as it’s available, then produce a data-backed, day-by-day sentiment narrative for the past week with a detailed table.

If you’d like me to proceed now, I’ll start with Option A and deliver:
- Executive snapshot
- Daily sentiment themes (high-level, qualitative) for the past week
- Top social-media themes (content slate, pricing changes, platform policy/feature updates)
- Recent company news highlights and how they impact sentiment
- Trader-oriented implications (catalysts, risks, sentiment vs. fundamentals)
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points

Would you prefer Option A (qualitative analysis now) or wait for the data pull (Option B)? If you have any preferences (e.g., focus on subscriber trends, content slate, or ad-revenue), tell me and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.
