I attempted to fetch NFLX data and compute the requested indicators, but I’m running into an environment error (FileNotFoundError) from the data source. It looks like the data access layer is not currently available for this session. I can retry if you’d like, or try a narrower window or alternate data path. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan and the indicator selection I’d use once data is retrievable, plus how I’d interpret the signals for NFLX.

Indicator selection (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for spotting a sustained trend vs. chop when combined with faster indicators.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; confirms major trend direction and can reveal golden/death cross signals when paired with other timing tools.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures short-term momentum shifts and potential interim entry points; useful to confirm with longer-term trends.
- macd: MACD line (momentum). Provides crossovers and divergences relative to price and trend changes; useful in confirming trend strength when aligned with other indicators.
- macds: MACD Signal. The EMA smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line help trigger or filter entries.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength visualization; helps detect divergences and shifts in momentum more quickly in fast markets.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; best used with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility; informs risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and helps adapt to changing market volatility during earnings moves or regime changes.

Why these are suitable for NFLX (contextual notes)
- NFLX is a high-variance tech/entertainment stock that often moves significantly on earnings and guidance. Using both trend (50/200 SMA) and momentum (MACD family, RSI) provides a balanced view of “where the stock is going” and “how strong the move is.”
- The MACD trio (macd, macds, macdh) offers a fuller view of momentum, momentum changes, and the strength of those changes, which is valuable in a stock prone to momentum bursts.
- ATR adds a practical lens for risk management in a volatile name like NFLX, helping to adjust stops and position sizes in line with current volatility.

How I’d interpret signals once data is available
- Trend context: If price is above the 50 SMA and 200 SMA with the 50 SMA above the 200 SMA, the trend is bullish; look for pullback entries to the moving averages or the 10 EMA for potential entries. If price is below both SMAs or the 50 SMA crosses below the 200 SMA, view as bearish or mixed until a clear reversal.
- Momentum validation: A bullish crossover in MACD (MACD line crossing above MACD Signal) and a positive MACD histogram (macdh rising) strengthens a bullish entry case, especially if RSI is not in extreme overbought territory. A bearish MACD crossover with negative histogram supports caution or a potential exit.
- Oscillator checks: RSI breaking above/below ~70/30 can signal overbought/oversold conditions, but in strong trends RSI can stay extended; rely on trend context and MACD signals to avoid false reversals.
- Volatility considerations: ATR rising implies higher risk and wider stop ranges; consider widening stops or reducing position size. A contracting ATR with favorable price action can tighten risk controls and allow tighter stops.

Suggested trading workflow (once data is available)
- Step 1: Confirm trend with close_50_sma and close_200_sma. If bullish, prefer long bias; if bearish, look for short bias or trend reversal signals.
- Step 2: Confirm momentum with macd/macds/macdh. Favor entries when MACD line crosses above Signal and histogram turns positive, ideally with price staying above the 10 EMA for added momentum support.
- Step 3: Use RSI to time entries, but only after trend/momentum alignment. Avoid chasing buys when RSI is deeply overbought in an uptrend; consider exits or partials if RSI worsens on rising price.
- Step 4: Calibrate risk with ATR. Set stop loss based on a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.5–2x ATR) and adjust position size to keep risk per trade within your plan.
- Step 5: Use MACD histogram signals to adjust pace of entries/exits; confirm with price action (candle patterns around support/resistance near SMAs).

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval and compute these indicators as soon as the data source is accessible. Do you want me to:
  - Retry immediately with the same NFLX window, or
  - Narrow the window (e.g., 2024-2025 calendar year only) to increase the chance of a successful data fetch, or
  - Try an alternate data path if available?

Markdown table: Key points to remember
- Indicator set (8): close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macds, macdh, rsi, atr
- Purpose: Trend (50/200 SMA), short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD trio), momentum strength (MACD Histogram), overbought/oversold context (RSI), volatility risk management (ATR)
- NFLX insights aim: Balance trend confirmation with momentum shifts; manage risk in a volatile tech name; align entries with confirmed momentum and avoid overreacting to single-signal moves
- Action plan: Rerun data fetch, then generate the precise values for NFLX and produce an integrated signal interpretation

Table (summary)
| Indicator | Type | What it tells you | How it helps NFLX decisions |
|----------|------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Confirms trend direction; filter entries with faster signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend; major trend context | Trend confirmation; watch for golden/death cross setups |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum; quick shifts | Signals timely entry/exit around main trend |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend changes via crossovers | Primary signal for entry/exit when aligned with price trend |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD; crossovers trigger trades | Helps time entries with MACD crossovers |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength; divergence indication | Early momentum shifts; complements MACD lines |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold levels; potential reversals | Time entries, especially after trend confirmation; watch divergences |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level; risk management | Set stops/position sizes; adapt to volatility regime |

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry right away or adjust the window/date range and then provide a full, data-backed interpretation as soon as the data fetch succeeds.
