Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit sentiment data for PLTR (2025-10-04) using the get_reddit_stock_info tool, but that tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. I can retry in a moment, but I don’t want to waste your time if the backend is down.

How would you like to proceed?
- Option A: I retry now to fetch the Reddit data and then generate the full, data-backed long report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: I switch to a comprehensive qualitative analysis using other sources (recent PLTR news, earnings, partnerships, government contracts, and general social sentiment from platforms other than Reddit) and produce a detailed report with a Markdown table of key takeaways.
- Option C: You provide me any Reddit posts or snippets you want included, and I’ll synthesize them into the report.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option B (no immediate data pull from Reddit), here’s the plan I’ll follow to deliver a thorough long report:
1) Summary snapshot
   - Quick read on current sentiment tone (overall positive/negative/mixed) and notable directional shifts day-to-day over the past week.
   - High-level headline drivers (e.g., earnings, government contract news, product updates, regulatory concerns).

2) Daily sentiment and themes (past week)
   - Day-by-day sentiment trend derived from multiple social sources (Reddit, X/Twitter, forums) and any notable spikes in engagement.
   - Top themes by volume (e.g., Palantir Foundry adoption, AI capabilities, data privacy, competition, valuation/FTN chatter).

3) News and catalysts (past week)
   - Summary of any company announcements, partnerships, government contract wins/losses, regulatory updates, or macro events affecting PLTR.
   - Any notable analyst commentary or benchmark changes.

4) Market and risk context
   - How sentiment and news align with price action, volatility, and options activity if available.
   - Key risk factors for traders (policy/regulatory risk, competitive dynamics in AI/data analytics, execution risk in large contracts).

5) Thematic takeaways for traders
   - Short- to mid-term catalysts (earnings cadence, contract announcements, product launches).
   - Scenarios for price movement based on sentiment and news balance.
   - Suggested risk controls and position-sizing considerations.

6) Data-quality notes
   - Sources used, data recency, limitations, and caveats about sentiment data vs. actual fundamentals.

7) Markdown table (end of report)
   - A neatly organized table collating: Date, Sentiment, Engagement/Volume, Key Themes, Notable News, Implied Price Implication, Risk Factor.

If you want me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again and then produce the full long report with the table. Let me know which option you prefer.
