Sorry—the data fetch attempt ran into a tool/environment error.

What happened
- All parallel tool calls (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow for PLTR as of 2025-10-04) returned FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory.
- A single-tool retry also failed for insider sentiment.

What I can do next
Option 1: Retry now
- I can retry the same set of tool calls (in parallel) to pull the latest quarterly balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and insider data. If the underlying service is temporarily down, a retry often resolves it.

Option 2: Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis
- If you want to move ahead, I can provide a thorough, forward-looking fundamental analysis for PLTR based on public disclosures up to the latest known results and typical 2024–2025 dynamics (revenue mix, profitability trajectory, liquidity, cash burn, customer concentration, and insider activity context). I’ll clearly flag where data is uncertain or stale due to tool outages.

Option 3: Alternate data path
- If you’d like, I can wait for the tool service to recover and then run the full set again, or we can try a subset (e.g., only income statement and balance sheet) to get partial progress.

What I need from you
- Which option would you prefer? Retry now, proceed with qualitative analysis, or wait for tool recovery?
- If you want a qualitative analysis, I’ll proceed immediately and deliver a detailed report with risk factors, key drivers, and a Markdown table at the end.

Additionally, to set expectations, I’ll include the following structure in the final report (whichever path we take):
- Company profile and business model
- Recent financial highlights (revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS)
- Balance sheet snapshot (assets, liabilities, equity)
- Cash flow overview (operating, investing, financing)
- Liquidity and leverage metrics
- Revenue mix and customer concentration insights
- Profitability and efficiency trends
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (contextual interpretation)
- Key risks and catalysts
- Fine-grained, trader-focused insights (what to watch next)
- Markdown table summarizing key points (financials, trends, risks)

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.
