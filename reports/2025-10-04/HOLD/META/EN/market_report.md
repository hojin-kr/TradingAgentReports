Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch META data for 2024-01-01 to 2025-10-04 but encountered a tool error (FileNotFoundError from the data source). I can retry fetching the CSV, but I don’t have visibility into when the data source will be available again. In the meantime, I’ll lay out a robust plan using the most relevant indicators for META, explain why they’re suitable given META’s typical behavior, and provide a structured approach you can apply once the data is accessible. I’ve also selected up to 8 indicators that complement each other without redundancy.

Selected indicators (8 total) and rationale
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages, long-term trend)
  - Why: Helps identify the dominant long-term trend and acts as a dynamic support/resistance. For META, this is useful to gauge whether price is in a broad bullish or bearish regime, especially after earnings-driven moves.
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages, medium-term trend)
  - Why: Complements the 200 SMA to confirm trend direction and potential crossovers (golden/death cross signals) with a quicker read than the 200 SMA.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages, short-term momentum)
  - Why: Captures quick shifts in momentum and can flag timely entry/exit points. In choppy markets, this needs filtering with longer-term averages, which the 50/200 SMAs provide.
- macd (MACD)
  - Why: Core momentum indicator showing differences between two EMAs; crossovers signal potential trend changes. Useful for META’s sensitivity to earnings, product news, and ad-market cycles.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Why: Smoothed signal line for MACD; crossovers with the MACD line offer more reliable entries than MACD alone when paired with other filters.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Why: Visualizes momentum strength and helps spot divergence early. Complements MACD to confirm convexity/concavity in price action.
- rsi (RSI)
  - Why: Momentum oscillator used to flag overbought/oversold conditions and divergences. Important for META in strong uptrends (RSI can stay elevated) or in potential reversals around earnings news.
- atr (ATR)
  - Why: Measures volatility to inform risk management (position sizing, stop placement). META often experiences volatility spikes around earnings and product announcements; ATR helps adapt risk controls accordingly.

What this set provides
- Trend confirmation: 200_SMA and 50_SMA give a clear view of the ongoing trend and potential regime shifts.
- Momentum timing and validation: MACD-related lines/histogram plus RSI offer both timing cues and momentum strength checks.
- Risk management: ATR informs stop-loss placement and position sizing, crucial for volatile tech names like META.
- Complementary signals: Short-term (10 EMA) with mid/long-term SMAs, plus MACD family signals, minimizes false entries in mixed-price environments.

How to interpret (guide for META, once data is available)
- Crossovers:
  - If price is above both 200_SMA and 50_SMA and 10_EMA is above 50_SMA, look for bullish momentum signals (MACD line crossing above MACD Signal, MACD Histogram turning positive). Consider entering on pullbacks toward the moving averages, with a stop below the nearest support.
  - If price trades below 200_SMA and 50_SMA, with 10_EMA crossing below 50_SMA, favor bearish setups; look for MACD bearish crossover and rising RSI bearish divergence as confirmation.
- RSI considerations:
  - RSI above 70: potential overbought; look for signs of a reversal or continuation only if supported by price action and MACD strength weakening.
  - RSI below 30: potential oversold; consider upside reversals only if MACD confirms momentum shift and price holds above key moving averages.
  - Be wary of divergences (price making new highs/lows while RSI fails to do so) as early reversal signals, particularly around earnings events.
- ATR-based risk:
  - Rising ATR: expect wider price swings; widen stops and possibly reduce position size to manage risk.
  - Falling ATR: volatility compresses; look for tighter entries on breakouts or pullbacks to stronger confluence areas (e.g., price near 50/200 SMA with MACD momentum alignment).
- Confirmation framework:
  - Favor trades where at least two momentum signals align (e.g., MACD bullish crossover and RSI turning upward from oversold) plus price confluence near a moving average support/resistance level.
  - Use ATR to size risk rather than relying on a fixed stop; this helps adapt to META’s volatile earnings cycles.

Next steps (recommended)
- I can retry fetching the data now or as soon as the data source becomes available again.
- If you prefer, I can run the analysis using a stand-in dataset you provide (e.g., a CSV you upload) or switch to a different data source if you have one.
- Once data is accessible, I will produce:
  - A detailed trend and momentum narrative for META over the requested period.
  - Concrete trade signals or viewpoints aligned with the 8 indicators above.
  - A Markdown table summarizing the indicators, interpretations, and notes specific to META’s context during 2024–2025.

Markdown table: indicators, category, and rationale for META
| Indicator | Category | Rationale for META (2024–2025 context) |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages - long-term trend | Establishes the overarching regime (bullish/bearish) and helps filter signals during earnings-driven volatility. |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages - mid-term trend | Confirms trend direction and aids in identifying golden/death cross dynamics with 200_SMA. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages - short-term momentum | Captures quick momentum shifts, useful for timely entries around news/events. |
| macd | MACD | Core momentum signal; crossovers indicate potential trend changes in META’s volatile environment. |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothed confirmation of MACD signals; reduces false positives when used with other filters. |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences to anticipate reversals. |
| rsi | RSI | Momentum gauge for overbought/oversold and divergences; helpful around earnings when price can move sharply. |
| atr | Volatility | Guides risk management and position sizing amid META’s earnings-driven volatility. |

Would you like me to:
- Retry fetching META data now, or
- Proceed with a qualitative analysis using a hypothetical framework (without real-time data) and you provide the data later, or
- Use an alternative data source you specify or upload a CSV so I can generate the indicators and the detailed report?
