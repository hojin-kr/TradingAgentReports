I attempted to pull the latest fundamental data for META (Meta Platforms, Inc.) using all available tools, but the calls returned a file-not-found error from the execution environment. Specifically:

- get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment (META, 2025-10-04): FileNotFoundError
- get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions (META, 2025-10-04): FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_balance_sheet (META, quarterly, 2025-10-04): FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_cashflow (META, quarterly, 2025-10-04): FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_income_stmt (META, quarterly, 2025-10-04): FileNotFoundError

What this means
- The data sources are currently unavailable due to an environment issue, not because META data is missing.
- I can re-run the data fetch as soon as the tool environment is restored, or I can proceed with a qualitative, methodology-focused report in the meantime and fill in the numeric details once the data comes back.

How you’d like to proceed
- Option A: I retry data retrieval now and then deliver a full, data-filled report with insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement, plus a detailed trader-focused analysis.
- Option B: I provide a comprehensive qualitative analysis of META’s fundamentals (based on publicly known trends up to 2024–2025) and a robust analysis framework, with placeholders for where the data will go once the tools return.
- Option C: You provide alternative data sources or allow me to use older publicly available data as a baseline, then I annotate what’s new in the past week once the tools come back.

What I will deliver in either case
- A comprehensive fundamental report covering:
  - Company profile (META): business model, product lines, key revenue drivers, market position, competitive landscape, strategic initiatives (e.g., AI, monetization, platform ecosystem, ad demand dynamics).
  - Income statement highlights (past few quarters/annuals): revenues, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS, margins, growth trends.
  - Balance sheet highlights: assets (cash, equivalents, investments), liabilities, equity, liquidity and leverage metrics.
  - Cash flow highlights: operating cash flow, investing cash flow, financing cash flow, free cash flow, cash conversion cycle considerations.
  - Insider sentiment (directional read on insiders’ views over the last 15 days) and insider transactions (net buys/sells) when data is available, with implications for sentiment-driven moves.
  - Trend analysis (QoQ/YoY): revenue growth, margin progression, cash flow sustainability, capex intensity, and debt posture.
  - Risk factors and trader-oriented insights: profitability/cash flow durability, exposure to ad market cycles, AI/ML investment impact, potential catalysts (product launches, platform changes, regulatory considerations), and potential negative catalysts.
  - A concise “What this means for traders” section with actionable takeaways and caveats.
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing key points, as requested.

Next step
