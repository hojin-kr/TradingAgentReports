I attempted to fetch Reddit stock info for META for 2025-09-28 to 2025-10-04 in parallel, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all calls (and even the single-date attempt for 2025-10-04 failed). Here are the exact errors seen:

- "Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory') Please fix your mistakes."

Because of this tool failure, I can’t pull the Reddit sentiment data right now. Here are your options to move forward:

Options to proceed
- Retry the Reddit data fetch: I can try again now (either for all dates in one go or date-by-date to see if any call succeeds).
- Use alternative sources: If you’d like, I can proceed with a comprehensive analysis focusing on:
  - Public news and company announcements about META over the past week
  - General sentiment signals from other social media (if you can authorize or provide data)
  - Market reaction to META’s recent earnings, product updates, regulatory news, and headlines
- Draft with placeholders: I can produce a detailed report framework now, with placeholders for sentiment scores and key points, so we’re ready to fill in once the Reddit data is accessible.

What would you prefer?
- Retry Reddit data fetch now (single-date or all dates)?
- Proceed with a JSX/structured report using only news and generic sentiment signals (no Reddit data) and flag where Reddit data would be inserted?
- Provide any alternative data sources or formats you want me to incorporate?

What I can deliver once data is in (structure you’ll get regardless):
- Executive snapshot of META’s sentiment and news tone over the past week
- Daily sentiment trend analysis with granular bullet points on notable spikes (positive/negative drivers)
- Key themes from social chatter and news (e.g., AI/Metaverse initiatives, advertising revenue, regulatory risk, user engagement)
- Implications for traders: potential short-term catalysts, risk factors, and positioning considerations
- A concise Makrdown table at the end summarizing:
  - Date
  - Primary sentiment driver
  - News/context note
  - Implied risk/reward flag
  - Suggested trader action

If you’re ready, tell me which path to take (retry or proceed with the alternative).
