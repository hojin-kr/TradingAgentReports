Verdict: Hold META now.

Rationale aligned with the plan:
- Near-term headwinds dominate: ongoing regulatory scrutiny, capex intensity (AI infra and internal silicon initiatives), and ad-market cyclicality create margin uncertainty in the near term.
- Longer-term optionality remains intact: AI-driven monetization and a durable platform moat offer meaningful upside, but the evidence for a clear, near-term cash-flow uplift is not yet concrete.
- Therefore, a cautious stance captures upside without overpaying for long-run potential until catalysts materialize.

Upgrade to Buy would require:
- Visible, sustained near-term free cash flow and margin expansion driven by AI-enabled ad formats and non-ad monetization (quantifiable ARPU lift) within 2–4 quarters.
- Clear progress on CoreWeave/Rivos milestones that meaningfully reduce unit costs and improve run-rate margins.
- Regulatory clarity that meaningfully lowers near-term compliance costs or constraints.

Downgrade to Sell would trigger on:
- Material earnings miss with sustained margin deterioration beyond a predefined threshold, or
- A meaningful regulatory setback with tangible cost impact beyond current pricing.

Operational plan highlights (if you already hold META or add size on confirmation signals):
- Risk: cap exposure 1–2% of portfolio per trade; employ ATR-based stops.
- Entry/exit: wait for a confluence of signals indicating a durable uptrend before increasing exposure; otherwise maintain position with defined downside protection.
- Hedging: protective puts or collar structures around events with high headline risk if you’re already long.
- Monitoring cadence: watch regulatory updates, AI infra milestones, ad monetization progress, earnings cadence, and macro ad spend signals; reassess quarterly or around major milestones.
- Timeframe: short horizon 4–8 weeks around data events; medium horizon 6–12 months for meaningful reassessment if catalysts evolve.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
