I’m sorry — I couldn’t fetch the data for AAPL due to a data-access error in the environment (FileNotFoundError from the data source). I can’t generate the real-time indicator readings right now. If you’d like, I can:

- Retry fetching the data now, or
- Use an alternate data source (if you can authorize one), or
- Proceed with a prepared framework and wait for data to be available, then deliver a full, data-driven report.

In the meantime, I’ve prepared the indicator selection and a detailed plan for what we’ll analyze once the data is retrieved. I’m proposing to use the following 8 indicators to provide complementary, non-redundant insights for AAPL:

Selected indicators (8)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Rationale for these indicators
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction; helps identify dynamic support/resistance around the 50-day horizon.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming overall market regime and watching for golden/death cross signals.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum shift indicator; captures quicker price moves and potential entry points, when used with longer-term filters.
- macd: Core momentum signal; crossovers between MACD line and price trend help identify trend changes in conjunction with other filters.
- macds: MACD Signal; smoother confirmation of MACD-derived signals; reduces false positives when considered with macd and macdh.
- macdh: MACD Histogram; visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences ahead of crossovers.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; useful in assessing exhaustion or continuation within the trend context.
- atr: Measure of volatility; informs risk management (stop placement and position sizing) relative to current volatility.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A nuanced, date-aligned synthesis of each indicator’s readings for AAPL over the selected period (2024-10-04 to 2025-10-04, or your preferred window).
- Identification of convergences/divergences across indicators (e.g., price above 50 sma and 200 sma with bullish MACD/histogram while RSI shows no extreme overbought condition).
- Contextual notes on trend strength, potential pullbacks, breakout zones, and volatility-driven risk management signals using ATR.
- Clear trading implications: potential entries, exits, or risk-management adjustments based on the combination of signals, with caveats for false positives in choppy markets.
- A concise, reader-friendly Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points (indicator role, signal types, and trading implications).

Proposed table structure (to be populated after data is available)

| Indicator | Category | Key Signals to Monitor | Trading Implications for AAPL (contextual) |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Price crossing above/below 50SMA; price vs. 50SMA as support/resistance | … |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation; golden/death cross with price action | … |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts; crossovers with price/other averages | … |
| macd | MACD Related | MACD line vs. signal; direction/magnitude of momentum | … |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD Signal crossovers; alignment with macd | … |
| macdh | MACD Related | Histogram momentum strength/divergence | … |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold signals; divergences | … |
| atr | Volatility | e.g., rising ATR suggests higher risk; use for stop placement | … |

Next steps
- Please confirm if you’d like me to retry data retrieval now, or provide an alternative data source (or your own CSV) so I can compute and deliver a full, data-driven report.
- If you prefer, I can also proceed with a hypothetical example analysis using typical interpretations of these indicators, but I’ll clearly label it as illustrative rather than data-derived until the data is available.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now or switch to a different data approach?
