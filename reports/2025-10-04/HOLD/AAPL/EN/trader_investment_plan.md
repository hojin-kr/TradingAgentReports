Recommendation: HOLD

Rationale:
- The plan you provided presents a balanced near-term view: strong long-run Services and AI monetization potential vs. near-term macro/regulatory risks and hardware cyclicality. Given the high valuation, near-term catalysts are not guaranteed, so the prudent stance remains “Hold” rather than a new long entry.
- The bull case hinges on durable Services margin expansion and tangible AI monetization, but execution risk and regulatory headwinds could delay benefits or compress multiples if progress stalls.
- A clear upgrade path exists: upgrade to Buy only if verifiable catalysts appear (e.g., two consecutive quarters of expanding Services margins with a credible margin uplift from mix, plus measurable AI monetization signals; plus regulatory clarity; plus stabilizing hardware demand).

Catalysts that would justify upgrading to Buy:
- Verifiable Services margin improvement: two consecutive quarters of expanding Services operating margin, supported by mix shift and cost leverage.
- AI monetization signal: measurable ARPU lift or cross-sell improvements tied to AI-enabled features within 6–12 months.
- Regulatory clarity that reduces margin risk in App Store economics.
- Sustained, stabilizing demand signals for hardware (regional resilience, pricing power, or mix improvements).

Triggers to trim/sell or rethink exposure:
- Services margin stalls or deteriorates for two consecutive quarters without offsetting factors.
- Material regulatory developments that raise costs or constrain monetization.
- Meaningful deterioration in hardware demand without offsetting AI/Services momentum.
- Macro/FX headwinds intensify with no near-term growth catalysts.

Risk controls:
- Maintain modest position sizing (e.g., max 1–2% per name relative to total risk budget).
- Use protective hedges (puts, collars) if already long or to manage option-like exposure.
- Dynamic stop strategy tied to ATR and key levels (moving averages, recent swing lows).

Monitoring plan:
- Track Services margin trajectory and AI monetization metrics each quarter.
- Watch regulatory developments and Vision Pro/AI monetization progress.
- Reassess risk-reward annually or sooner if macro conditions shift materially.

Bottom line:
- Hold today, with a disciplined upgrade to Buy only upon clear, verifiable catalysts materializing (margin expansion, AI monetization progress, regulatory clarity, and stabilizing hardware demand). If catalysts fail to materialize, be prepared to re-evaluate exposure.
