# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
Near term, Nvidia’s dominance in AI data-center compute, ROCm adoption gaps, and margin/macro headwinds create downside risk for AMD. Sell (reduce exposure) now, hedge downside, and wait for clear momentum signals to re-enter.

## Investment Decision
Investment Decision: SELL with high confidence. Reduce exposure now, implement a hedging plan to limit losses, and enter gradually only on confirmed momentum signals.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Nvidia dominates AI data-center compute, limiting AMD’s pricing power and share gains.
- ROCm software ecosystem and developer adoption trail CUDA, restricting AMD’s platform appeal.
- Margin risk remains from data-center mix and macro AI capex uncertainty; near-term earnings quality could weaken.
- Near-term catalysts could trigger rapid valuation compression if momentum stalls, making a decisive Sell prudent.

## Risks To Watch
- Positive catalysts that could improve the outlook: stronger data-center momentum for AMD, ROCm traction catching up, and margin stabilization or improvement as AI demand flows through.
- Negative catalysts that could worsen the view: DC momentum stalls, ROCm traction remains weak, ASP/mix deterioration worsens margins, macro AI capex slows, or Nvidia further extends its lead.
- Execution/plan risks: hedging and staged re-entry depend on data signals; abrupt price moves or data revisions could alter timing and outcomes. Market volatility could affect entry levels and liquidity.
