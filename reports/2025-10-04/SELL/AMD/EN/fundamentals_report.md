I ran into a data-access issue pulling AMD’s latest fundamentals from the tools (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I’m not able to retrieve insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the latest quarterly balance sheet/income statement/cash flow right now. I can:

- Retry the data pulls now or in a few minutes, or
- Provide a qualitative AMD fundamentals overview based on public context up to 2024–2025 and give you a framework for the full report, which I’ll populate once the data tools are available.

Options:
1) Retry now: I’ll reattempt all data calls (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) and then produce a comprehensive report with a Markdown table of key points.
2) Qualitative overview (no fresh data): I’ll deliver a thorough AMD fundamentals overview (business profile, competitive landscape, typical margins, historical trends, risks, catalysts) plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table skeleton for you to populate once data is accessible.
3) Mixed approach: I provide the qualitative analysis now and stage the data-backed sections to be filled in as soon as the data tools come back online.

If you’d like, I can proceed with option 2 or 1 right away. Also, if you have a preference for focusing on quarterly vs. annual data, tell me and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.

Proposed structure for the eventual report (will be populated with data when available):
- Executive summary
- Company profile
  - Business model, segments (Computing/Graphics, Data Center, Embedded)
  - Major customers and end markets
- Financial snapshot (latest quarter)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS
  - Key drivers (CPU/GPU releases, AI-related demand, data center demand)
- Income statement (historical trend)
  - Revenue growth YoY/QoQ
  - COGS and gross margin trend
  - OpEx, operating income, net income
- Balance sheet (latest)
  - Cash & equivalents, debt levels, working capital
  - Share count/stock-based compensation implications
- Cash flow statement (latest)
  - Operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
- Insider transactions (past 15 days)
- Key ratios and metrics
  - Gross margin, operating margin, net margin
  - ROE, ROA, current ratio, debt/equity
  - FCF yield, cash conversion cycle (if available)
- Trend analysis
  - Quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year delta
  - Sector/market comparison (semis, AI-driven demand)
- Risks and catalysts
  - Competitive landscape (Intel, Nvidia)
  - Supply chain, foundry capacity, wafer supply
  - AI cycle, product launches (e.g., new Ryzen/EPYC/MI GPUs) and data center adoption
- Trading implications
  - Catalyst timeline, volatility considerations, liquidity
- Appendices
  - Raw data tables (once populated)
  - Markdown table of key points (for easy reading)

Please tell me which option you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly. If you want me to retry immediately, I’ll fetch the data as soon as the tool service responds and deliver the full, data-backed report with the final Markdown table.
