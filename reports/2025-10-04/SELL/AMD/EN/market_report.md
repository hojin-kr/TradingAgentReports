I attempted to fetch AMD data but encountered a data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError from the Yahoo Finance backend). I can retry the data pull right away, or proceed with a strategy-focused indicator setup based on AMD’s typical market dynamics, and run the data fetch again when you’re ready. Below is a detailed indicator selection and a nuanced interpretation framework you can use once the data is available.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8 indicators)
- close_200_sma
  - Purpose: Long-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to read: Price above 200SMA suggests a long-term uptrend; price below suggests a long-term downtrend.
  - Trading implication: Favor long entries in uptrends and avoid aggressive shorts unless other signals weaken.

- close_50_sma
  - Purpose: Mid-term trend direction and trend strength.
  - How to read: Price relative to 50SMA shows mid-term momentum; if 50SMA holds above price, risk of pullback increases; crossovers with 200SMA (golden cross when 50SMA crosses above 200SMA, death cross when it crosses below) signal regime changes.
  - Trading implication: Use for trend confirmation and pullback entries during inclination to trend.

- close_10_ema
  - Purpose: Short-term momentum and quick shift signals.
  - How to read: Price/indicator ticks above/below 10EMA indicate immediate momentum; crossovers with price or longer SMAs can signal entries/exits.
  - Trading implication: Use for tactical entries in conjunction with slower averages to filter noise.

- macd
  - Purpose: Primary momentum gauge and trend-change signals.
  - How to read: MACD line crossing the signal line, MACD histogram turning positive/negative, and movement relative to zero line.
  - Trading implication: Look for crossovers and bullish/bearish momentum shifts, but confirm with the other indicators to reduce false signals in range-bound markets.

- macds
  - Purpose: Smoothing of MACD momentum; strengthens signal timing.
  - How to read: Crosses with MACD line (macd) to generate trade triggers; divergence with price strengthens conviction.
  - Trading implication: Use as a confirmation layer for MACD cross signals.

- macdh
  - Purpose: Momentum strength via MACD histogram.
  - How to read: Rising histogram indicates strengthening move; shrinking histogram or color change signals fading momentum.
  - Trading implication: Helpful to assess the sustainability of moves suggested by MACD.

- rsi
  - Purpose: Momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to read: RSI values near 70+ suggest overbought; near 30- suggest oversold; watch for divergences with price.
  - Trading implication: Use as a momentum filter and potential reversal/exit signals, especially when price action diverges from RSI.

- atr
  - Purpose: Volatility measurement and risk management.
  - How to read: Higher ATR implies higher volatility; lower ATR implies calmer markets.
  - Trading implication: Use ATR to size positions and set stops; adjust position sizing when volatility spikes.

Nuanced interpretation framework for AMD (contextual guidance, once data is available)
- Scenario 1: Uptrend with expanding momentum
  - Readings: price above 200SMA and 50SMA; 10EMA above price or crossing upward; macd bullish (MACD above signal, positive histogram); RSI climbing but not extreme; ATR moderate.
  - Action: Favor long entries on pullbacks toward the 50SMA or 10EMA with stop placement informed by ATR. Use MACD/macd/macdh for timing, RSI for confirmation that momentum is not overextended.

- Scenario 2: Range-bound or choppy market
  - Readings: price oscillating around 50SMA; MACD near zero or showing intermittent cross signals; RSI bouncing between 40–60; ATR low.
  - Action: Favor smaller-position trades within a defined range or wait for a strong breakout. Rely on the MACD histograms for early momentum shifts and use ATR to keep risk in check.

- Scenario 3: Reversal risk or breakdown
  - Readings: price failing to clear 200SMA or crossing below; 50SMA crossing under 200SMA (death cross); MACD turning negative with histogram expansion; RSI rolling toward oversold; ATR picking up.
  - Action: Consider protective exits or hedges; avoid aggressive long entries until price demonstrates durable support/regained momentum. If a reversal signals strengthen, look for confirmation across multiple indicators before new long risk.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the AMD data immediately (start date and end date can be the same as before or adjusted to your preference). Once the data is retrieved, I will generate the indicators and deliver:
  - A detailed, data-backed trend and momentum report.
  - Specific entry/exit signals given the current readings.
  - A Markdown table summarizing the key points (see table example at the end).

If you’d like me to proceed with a retry now, I’ll run the data pull again and then provide a full, data-driven report using the 8 indicators above.

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and reading guidance
| Indicator | Purpose | How to read | Trading implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend direction | Price above = uptrend; below = downtrend | Align trades with long-term trend; prefer pullbacks for entries |
| close_50_sma | Mid-term trend direction | Price relative to 50SMA; golden/death cross with 200SMA | Use for trend confirmation and pullback entries |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Position of price to 10EMA; short-term cross signals | Tactical entries; filter with longer-term signals |
| macd | Momentum and trend-change signals | MACD line vs signal; histogram magnitude; zero line | Use cross signals with confirmation from other indicators |
| macds | MACD smoothing for confirmation | Crosses with MACD; divergence with price | Strengthen MACD-based signals |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram rising/falling | Assess sustainability of moves signaled by MACD |
| rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold | >70 overbought; <30 oversold; divergences | Use as momentum filter and reversal cue |
| atr | Volatility and risk management | Higher ATR = higher volatility | Position sizing and stop-placement adjustments |

Please tell me if you want me to retry the data fetch right away, and I’ll run it and deliver a fully data-driven AMD report using the indicators above.
