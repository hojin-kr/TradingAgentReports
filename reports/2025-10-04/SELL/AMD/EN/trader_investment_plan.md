After reviewing the provided plan, I concur with the bear-case near term and recommend a decisive action to reduce exposure to AMD now. The near-term risks—Nvidia’s continued DC dominance, ROCm maturity concerns versus CUDA, potential margin pressure from a DC-heavy mix, and macro/AI capex uncertainty—outweigh the longer-term multi-generational AI data-center thesis without clearer, multi-quarter evidence of sustained DC momentum and margin resilience.

Key reasons supporting a SELL-oriented stance now:
- Structural headwinds in AI data-center compute favor Nvidia, pressuring AMD’s DC share and pricing power.
- ROCm’s ecosystem maturity remains a risk factor versus CUDA’s established adoption, potentially dampening AMD’s software moat.
- Margin risk from DC mix: a ramp in high-value DC sales is not guaranteed and could be offset by costs or slower-than-expected adoption.
- Near-term macro and PC-cycle softness could damp AI capex, compressing earnings quality and multiples.

Strategic actions you can implement today:
- Reduce exposure: trim AMD 25-50% of your position to align with your risk tolerance. If you’re already small, maintain a core but with a clearly capped risk.
- Risk controls: set stops and consider hedging (e.g., long-dated puts or a modest put spread) to limit downside while preserving some upside optionality.
- Re-entry plan: only re-engage on a regime shift confirmed by the 8-indicator framework (e.g., price above 50SMA with rising MACD, constructive RSI, stabilized ATR) and evidence of improving DC momentum (bookings/backlog signals, ASP/mix improvements).
- Ongoing monitoring: review the 8 indicators weekly and after quarterly results; watch DC bookings, software traction (ROCm ecosystem engagement), and any commentary on supply costs.
- Diversification: balance exposure with other AI/semis names (Nvidia, Intel, ASML, Broadcom) to avoid single-name risk if the bear case strengthens.

Final decision:
FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
