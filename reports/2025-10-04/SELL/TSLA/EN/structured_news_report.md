# Daily Trading Intelligence: TSLA

## Executive Snapshot
- TSLA posted a record Q3 on deliveries (497,099) and energy storage (~12.5 GWh), underscoring near-term momentum across vehicles and storage despite macro headwinds.
- Europe shows mixed but constructive signals (France/Denmark rebound; Sweden/Netherlands softer); Middle East expansion (Qatar) and Cybertruck momentum support upside sentiment.
- Key risks: expiry of U.S. EV tax credits; heightened FSD regulatory scrutiny; ongoing investor litigation around pay packages.
- Analyst targets disperse broadly (400s to higher), reflecting debate on demand durability, AI/robotics upside, and valuation risk.
- Macro backdrop: inflation trends and Fed policy guide discount rates; energy/storage economics and lithium/nickel costs influence margins.

## Macro Backdrop
- Inflation trajectory and policy expectations continue to drive equity multiples and discount rates.
- Global EV demand and energy-storage economics hinge on policy timing (U.S. credits) and energy policy in Europe.
- Commodity dynamics (lithium, nickel) affect Tesla’s cost structure and margin trajectory.
- Macro uncertainty warrants selective exposure to growth names with durable demand signals and clearer cadence in storage/AI software.
