I’m hitting an internal error with the Reddit stock info tool right now (FileNotFoundError). It seems the data fetch for TSLA on 2025-10-04 cannot be retrieved at the moment. I can’t pull live Reddit data for today until the tool is fixed.

What I can do next (options):
- Option A: Retry later and continue the full, Reddit-plus-news sentiment report once the tool is available.
- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using other public sources and standard sentiment methodologies (without live data from the Reddit tool). I can structure the report, outline expected drivers, and note typical sentiment patterns for TSLA, but I won’t have the exact day-by-day Reddit sentiment figures.
- Option C: If you can provide or authorize access to alternative sources (e.g., you paste excerpts from Reddit/Twitter/StockTwits, or allow me to analyze a provided dataset), I’ll incorporate those into the report.

If you’d like me to proceed now without the Reddit tool, I propose the following plan:
- Build a detailed TSLA sentiment and news framework focusing on:
  - Daily sentiment drivers (general tone, notable posts, and spikes in mentions)
  - Key catalysts over the past week (earnings, product updates, regulatory news, supply chain)
  - Market rhetoric around demand, margins, and guidance
  - Options activity signals (implied volatility, skew) if available from public sources
  - Cross-source triangulation (Reddit-style communities, Twitter/X, StockTwits, mainstream outlets)
- Provide actionable insights for traders:
  - Potential short-term catalysts and risk factors
  - Sentiment fatigue or overhang signals
  - How sentiment aligns or diverges from price action
- End with a Markdown table summarizing key takeaways, notable catalysts, sentiment tone, and potential trading implications.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want the best possible result right now, I recommend Option A (retry later) or Option B (best-effort qualitative analysis without the Reddit tool).
