I ran into an internal data retrieval error trying to fetch TSLA fundamentals and insider data. The parallel requests (and subsequent individual calls) returned FileNotFoundError, indicating the data sources or endpoints aren’t accessible right now.

What happened
- Attempts to fetch:
  - Finnhub insider sentiment for TSLA (past 15 days)
  - Finnhub insider transactions for TSLA (past 15 days)
  - SimFin balance sheet (quarterly)
  - SimFin income statement (quarterly)
  - SimFin cash flow (quarterly)
- All attempts returned similar FileNotFoundError errors.

What I can do next
Option A: Retry now
- I can immediately retry all data fetches. If the error persists, I’ll flag it and propose alternate steps.

Option B: Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals overview (no new data)
- I can provide a structured, trader-focused overview of Tesla (company profile, business segments, competitive landscape, typical financial metrics to watch, and insider sentiment/transactions interpretation) without pulling the latest numbers. This would be a high-level, non-numeric analysis and should be treated as context rather than a data-driven Sprint.

Option C: Use alternative data sources you specify
- If you have access to other data endpoints or can share a snapshot (CSV/JSON) of Tesla’s recent quarterly results and insider data, I can incorporate it and build the comprehensive report with a Markdown table at the end.

Recommendation
- If you want a data-driven, number-heavy report, I’d suggest I retry now and, if that fails again, switch to Option B (qualitative fundamentals) while we resolve the data source issue.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry data fetch now (A)
- Proceed with qualitative fundamentals (B)
- Use alternative data you provide (C)

Note: If you want me to proceed with Option B right away, I’ll deliver a comprehensive, trader-focused fundamentals report on Tesla as of the most recent context I can rely on, including:
- Company profile and segments (Automotive, Energy, Services)
- Competitive landscape and strategic catalysts (EV adoption, AI/robotaxi prospects, energy storage)
- High-level financials to watch (revenue drivers, gross margin pressure, R&D, capex trends)
- Insider sentiment/transactions interpretation (conceptual guidance on what to look for, even without fresh data)
- Key risk factors and macro considerations
- A Markdown table summarizing key points

Just tell me which path you want.
