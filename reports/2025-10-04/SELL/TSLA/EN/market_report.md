I attempted to fetch TSLA data and run the indicator reports, but I’m hitting a data-access error on the current environment (FileNotFoundError). I can’t pull the latest CSV data right now to generate live indicator values or a precise trend snapshot. If you’d like, I can retry, or proceed with a robust, indicator-driven framework so you can interpret TSLA’s setup once the data is available. Here’s a carefully chosen set of indicators (8 total) with rationale and how to use them together for TSLA.

Selected indicators (8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance
  - How to use: Identify trend direction (price above/below 50 SMA). Use as a baseline trend filter and potential support/resistance level.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark
  - How to use: Confirm overall market regime (bullish if price above 200 SMA, bearish if below). Watch for golden cross vs death cross with shorter moving averages as strategic cues.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Responsive short-term momentum
  - How to use: Capture quick shifts in momentum; can help with timing entries when aligned with longer-term trend signals.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: Momentum via difference of EMAs
  - How to use: Look for crossovers with the MACD line (signal line) and divergences to indicate potential trend changes; add weight in confirming signals from price and other indicators.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD signal (EMA-smoothed MACD)
  - How to use: Crosses with the MACD line to trigger or filter trades; helps reduce false positives when used with price action and trend indicators.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD histogram (momentum strength)
  - How to use: Assess momentum magnitude and potential divergences; useful as a complementary gauge alongside MACD/macd to gauge strength of moves.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - What it measures: Price momentum and overbought/oversold conditions
  - How to use: Use typical levels (overbought around 70, oversold around 30) with divergence analysis; in strong trends RSI can stay extended—cross-check with trend filters.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it measures: Market volatility (true range-based)
  - How to use: Set dynamic stop-loss distances and adjust position sizing relative to current volatility; helps with risk management in TSLA’s typically volatile environment.

How to interpret TSLA with these indicators (framework)
- Trend foundation
  - Confirm direction with 50 SMA and 200 SMA:
    - Uptrend: price above both, 50 SMA above 200 SMA
    - Downtrend: price below both, 50 SMA below 200 SMA
  - Use 10 EMA for timing: if price closes above the 10 EMA in an uptrend, it can indicate momentum-supported entries; if it crosses below in a downtrend, consider risk-off signals.
- Momentum confirmation
  - MACD (macd) cross above zero and MACD line crossing above its signal (macds) supports a bullish bias; a cross below zero and MACD crossing below signal supports bearish bias.
  - MACD histogram (macdh) rising in the same direction as the MACD cross strengthens conviction; a shrinking histogram can warn of a fading move.
- Momentum strength vs risk
  - RSI (rsi) should be checked for potential overbought/oversold zones but remember in strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated. Look for bullish/bearish divergences between price and RSI as potential early reversals.
- Volatility risk management
  - ATR (atr) provides a volatility gauge to size positions and place stops. Higher ATR means wider stops; lower ATR suggests tighter stops.

Trade-style implications (practical guidelines)
- When price is above 50SMA and 200SMA, RSI isn’t extreme to the upside, MACD demonstrates a bullish cross, and ATR indicates rising volatility but manageable, consider a long setup with risk managed by a stop based on ATR distance.
- If price is below both SMAs, MACD is bearish, RSI confirms weakness, and ATR is high (indicating volatility), be cautious with longs and consider short exposure or hedging, with stops sized via ATR.
- If MACD/macd cross signals conflict with price action (e.g., MACD bullish but price stuck below 50SMA), rely more on trend filters (SMA) and ATR for risk boundaries.
- Always prefer signals that are aligned across at least 2–3 indicators: trend (SMA), momentum (MACD/RSI), and volatility/risk (ATR).

Next steps (how I will proceed)
- I will retry fetching the data to generate a live indicator report for TSLA in this window. If the environment continues to produce FileNotFoundError, I can:
  - Use a fallback data source (if enabled) or
  - Provide a fully qualitative, signal framework using these eight indicators and guide you to run the checks locally or in your trading platform, or
  - Return with a fresh, data-backed report as soon as data access is restored.
- Once data is available, I will produce:
  - A detailed, fine-grained trend report for TSLA
  - Individual indicator readings and cross-indicator confirmations
  - A concise set of actionable trading signals with entry/exit guidance
  - A Markdown table summarizing key points (below)

Notes
- If you want me to continue trying in this session, I can reattempt the data pull now or wait for your go-ahead.
- If you prefer a different set of indicators or want to emphasize a specific strategy (scalping, swing, or longer-term), I can adjust the 8-indicator selection accordingly.

Markdown table: Key indicators and usage for TSLA
- Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use / signal interpretation
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Trend direction: price above/below 50SMA. Use as baseline trend filter.
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; macro regime | Confirm overall trend; watch for cross with 50SMA as strategic cue.
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Timing moves; confirm with longer-term trend
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum (EMA differences) | Bullish/bearish momentum via crossovers; use with trend checks
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line | Crossover with MACD line for trade triggers; filter noise
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength (histogram) | Magnitude and divergences; gauge move strength
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum and overbought/oversold | 70/30 thresholds; watch divergences with price/trend
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility | Set stops and position sizes; adapt to current volatility level

If you’d like, I can try the data fetch again now, or you can authorize a fallback approach and I’ll deliver the data-backed report as soon as access succeeds.
