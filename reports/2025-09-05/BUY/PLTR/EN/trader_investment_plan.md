Recommendation: Hold PLTR now.

Rationale (short):
- Near-term technicals remain soft: MACD negative, price hovering around the 50-day SMA, RSI ~44, and ATR shows meaningful swings. This adds up to a fragile risk-reward for new long exposure without a confirmed momentum shift.
- Long-term thesis intact: durable ARR growth across government and commercial AI, governance moat, and expanding partnerships could re-rate if momentum and margins improve.

Catalysts needed to upgrade to Buy:
- A clean reclaim of the 10-EMA (around 158–159) with above-average volume and a positive MACD cross.
- Alternatively, a clear reclaim of the 50-SMA near 156 with convincing volume and MACD turning positive.
- Visible progress on ARR growth, margin improvement, and backlog conversion timing (commercial ramp, onboarding efficiency, or meaningful government backlog wins that translate into revenue).

Risk management and actions:
- For new exposure: avoid chasing; use ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.5–2x ATR) and start with a small, staged entry if triggers fire.
- For existing exposure: maintain a core but pace incremental adds until momentum confirms.
- Consider hedges (protective puts or vertical spreads) around key catalysts to limit downside while keeping upside optionality.

Price levels to watch:
- Primary watch: 158–159 (10-EMA reclaim with volume).
- Secondary watch: around 156 (50-SMA reclaim with volume).
- Key downside if momentum worsens: support in the 150–145 region, with risk controls in place.

Bottom line:
- Hold today. Upgrade to Buy only on a sustained, volume-confirmed momentum breakout and tangible improvements in ARR/margin metrics. Until catalysts materialize, maintain disciplined risk and avoid aggressive new longs.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
