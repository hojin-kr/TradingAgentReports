Recommendation: HOLD

Rationale
- The plan’s core thesis remains intact for a multi-year horizon, but near-term dynamics are not yet confirming a breakout. Momentum looks mixed (RSI in the lower range, MACD not convincingly turning higher), and valuation remains rich amidst macro/regulatory uncertainty. No definitive breakout has occurred yet, so chasing adds incremental risk without a clearer risk-reward edge.

Key breakout criteria to watch (triggers to shift to BUY)
- Price action: A confirmed close above the 50-day SMA (~171.6) and the 10-day EMA (~175–177).
- Momentum: RSI rising above 50 and MACD histogram turning positive (convergence with price).
- Confirmation: A follow-through day with bullish price action in the next 1–2 sessions.

Defined risk controls if/when breakout occurs
- Stop: Place an ATR-based stop roughly 1.0–1.5x ATR below the breakout level (current ATR around 5, so a stop of about 5–7 points below entry, adjustable to real-time data).
- Sizing: Limit risk per trade to 1–2% of capital; if already capped by a position, consider a scaled entry or trailing stops rather than adding on strength alone.
- Hedging: Optional modest put hedge to cap downside during heightened macro/regulatory risk without capping upside on a breakout.

What to monitor regularly
- Macro/reg headlines affecting AI capex, export controls, and regional demand (especially China).
- Hyperscaler commentary on data-center spend cycles and AI backlog updates.
- Regional demand signals and supply-chain developments that could shift momentum.

Scenario planning
- Base case (hold): No breakout in the next 4–6 weeks; NVDA trades in a broad range with potential downside if headlines worsen but no structural break.
- Bull case (buy signal): Breakout confirmed as outlined above, with momentum re-accelerating; scale into a full position and target initial resistance near 178–179, then 180–185 if sustained.
- Bear case (risk escalation): Break below roughly 165–170 with increasing volume; trim exposure quickly or hedge.
