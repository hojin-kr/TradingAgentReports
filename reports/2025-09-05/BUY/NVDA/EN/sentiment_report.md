I hit a technical error trying to fetch NVDA news with the tool:

Error: AttributeError("'ResponseFunctionWebSearch' object has no attribute 'content'")

I can retry the data fetch now, or we can proceed with a plan in the meantime and I’ll fill in the data as soon as the tool succeeds. How would you like to proceed?

Options:
- Retry now: I’ll attempt the NVDA news fetch again for 2025-09-05 and then build a detailed, week-long sentiment/news report (including daily sentiment deltas, top themes, notable spikes, and implications for traders). I’ll also compile a Markdown table at the end to organize key points.
- Alternate scope: If you prefer, I can draft the full report framework and methodology first (without tool results) and then populate it once the news tool succeeds. This would include sections like sentiment trajectory, correlation with NVIDIA news events, risk/ops implications, and trading signals.

What would you like me to do? If you want me to retry, I’ll run another fetch immediately and proceed with the long-form report once I have the data.
