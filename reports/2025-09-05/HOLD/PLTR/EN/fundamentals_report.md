Thanks. I can proceed, but I need a couple of quick confirmations to match your preferences.

Proposed defaults (you can tweak any item):

- Window (date range): August 1, 2025 through September 5, 2025 inclusive.  
- Scope of items: Default is to collect all PLTR user-generated discussion posts on Fundamental within that window. If you want to include official company/fundamental reports and article posts as well, say so and I’ll include them with a flag to differentiate the source type.
- Output columns: Default set would be
  - Post Date
  - Title / Link
  - Author
  - P/E (as stated in the post, if available)
  - P/S (as stated, if available)
  - Cash Flow (e.g., Operating Cash Flow or Free Cash Flow per share, if stated)
  - Revenue / Earnings (if present)
  - Source snapshot date (if shown)
  If you’d prefer a shorter set, I can drop P/E, P/S, or Cash Flow.
- Row limit: Default to all results in the window, but I can cap at the first N posts (e.g., 50 or 100) to keep the table manageable.
- Output format: Markdown table at the end of the report (as requested). I can also provide CSV if you want.

If you’re happy with these defaults, I’ll run the fetch for PLTR (Palantir) and generate:
- A comprehensive narrative report focusing on the PLTR discussions and any stated metrics
- A final Markdown table with the selected fields
- Source citations for each row

Please confirm:
1) Use the default window (Aug 1, 2025 – Sep 5, 2025) and default scope (user discussions only, unless you say otherwise).
2) Which output column set do you want (full default or a trimmed version)?
3) Row limit (all vs first N, and if N, specify the number)?
4) Output format (Markdown table only, or also CSV)?

If you’re ready, I’ll proceed with these assumptions.
