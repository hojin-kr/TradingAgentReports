Sorry about that — I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock news for TSLA on 2025-10-24, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (2). It looks like the data source isn’t accessible right now.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry now: I can try to fetch the Reddit data again immediately.
- Alternate sources: I can compile a comprehensive analysis using other public sources (X/Twitter sentiment, StockTwits, news wires, company announcements) and clearly indicate the sources and limitations.
- Qualitative synthesis: I can produce a thorough, technically grounded TSLA sentiment and news analysis based on known events and typical themes (without day-by-day Reddit data), and clearly label where data is missing and what would be updated once Reddit data is available.

If you prefer, I can proceed with option 2 or 3 right away and outline the full report structure, including a Markdown table at the end to organize key points. Please tell me which path you’d like.
