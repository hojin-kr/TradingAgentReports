I attempted to fetch TSLA data and run the requested indicators, but the data tools returned a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can retry the data fetch, or proceed with a robust indicator framework you can use once data is available. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) with rationale tailored to TSLA’s typical behavior and a plan for how to interpret signals once the data is accessible.

Recommended indicators (8, complementary and non-redundant)
1) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it measures: Medium-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance.
- How to use: Look for price crossing above/below the 50 SMA for potential trend shifts; use with longer and shorter time horizons to filter signals.
- Why TSLA: TSLA often shows appreciable mid-term trend shifts driven by product cycles, demand signals, and earnings.

2) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark; overall market stance.
- How to use: Use crossovers with price or with the 50 SMA to identify potential golden/death cross signals. Provides broad trend context.
- Why TSLA: Helps confirm structural trend (bullish/bearish) beyond short-term volatility typical of high-growth tech names.

3) macd
- Category: MACD Related
- What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; trend change signals.
- How to use: Watch MACD line crossing the signal line, zero-line crosses, and divergences with price.
- Why TSLA: Momentum shifts can precede price moves, especially around earnings or demand news.

4) macds
- Category: MACD Related
- What it measures: MACD signal line; smoothed momentum movements.
- How to use: Use MACD line vs. MACD Signal crossovers to time entries/ exits with added confirmation.
- Why TSLA: Reduces false positives from MACD by providing a smoother signal, helpful in volatile TSLA sessions.

5) rsi
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- What it measures: Relative strength momentum; overbought/oversold tendencies.
- How to use: Typical thresholds 70/30; look for reversals or divergences; in strong trends RSI can stay extended, so use with trend direction.
- Why TSLA: RSI helps flag possible pullbacks during extended rallies or bottoms during sharp declines, especially around catalyst events.

6) boll
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it measures: Middle Bollinger Band (20 SMA) as a volatility-adjusted baseline.
- How to use: Price interactions with the middle band can indicate mean-reversion tendencies; confirm with bands/price action.
- Why TSLA: Provides a dynamic reference point for price normalization in volatile TSLA sessions.

7) boll_ub
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it measures: Upper Bollinger Band; potential overbought zones and breakout levels.
- How to use: Breakouts above the upper band may indicate strong momentum if supported by other signals; look for confluence with MACD/rsi.
- Why TSLA: TSLA often tests upper bands during bursts of demand or positive catalysts; signals warrant cross-checks with momentum.

8) atr
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it measures: True range-based volatility; magnitude of price moves.
- How to use: Use ATR to set dynamic stop-losses and position sizing; higher ATR implies wider stops.
- Why TSLA: High-volatility name; ATR helps manage risk by adapting to changing volatility regimes.

Notes on interpretation in TSLA's context
- Trend alignment: Prefer trades that align with the 50 SMA and 200 SMA direction. If price is above both and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA, bullish bias is stronger; vice versa for bearish bias.
- Momentum confirmation: Use MACD/macdS in combination with RSI to avoid chasing false breakouts in choppy sessions. Confirm a MACD cross with RSI not in overbought territory and with price staying above the 50/200 SMA.
- Volatility awareness: Use ATR for risk management; heightened ATR suggests wider stops and potentially larger position sizing adjustments. Boll_ub signals should be confirmed with momentum indicators before trading breakouts.
- Catalyst sensitivity: For TSLA, earnings, demand news, product announcements, and regulatory updates can drive sharp shifts. Rely on the combination of trend, momentum, and volatility signals rather than single indicators around such events.

What I can do next
- If you want, I can retry pulling TSLA data and compute these indicators exactly as named (close_50_sma, close_200_sma, macd, macds, rsi, boll, boll_ub, atr) for the specified date range. Please confirm you’d like me to retry, and I’ll run the fetch and present the resulting indicator values and a synthesis.
- Alternatively, you can paste the latest TSLA price data (or export it from your own source) and I’ll generate the indicator readings and a detailed actionable interpretation right away.

Appendix: quick-reference table of indicators and uses
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret (typical signals) | Use case for TSLA |
|---------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Mid-term trend direction | Price cross above/below for trend shift; use with longer/shorter averages | Confirm trend direction and filter entries |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend | Golden cross / death cross; price around/above/below the 200 SMA | Align trades with long-term regime |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD line vs signal cross; zero-line crosses; divergences | Time entries with momentum changes |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD Signal line | Crossovers with MACD for entry/exit confirmation | Reduce false signals from MACD alone |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Relative strength momentum | 70/30 levels; divergence signals | Spot reversals in overbought/oversold zones |
| boll | Volatility Indicators | middle Bollinger Band baseline | Price tests/bounces around middle band; mean-reversion cues | Baseline for mean-reversion checks |
| boll_ub | Volatility Indicators | Upper Bollinger Band | Breakouts or overbought-style persistence; confirm with other signals | Identify breakout potential with confirmation |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | True range volatility | Higher ATR = wider stops; adjust risk per session | Dynamic risk management in volatile TSLA moves |

Current status and next steps
- Data retrieval attempt encountered a tool-level error in this environment. I’m ready to retry the data fetch for TSLA with the exact parameters, or you can provide data from another source. Once I have the data, I’ll deliver a detailed indicator report and a concise trading-readiness summary.

Would you like me to retry fetching TSLA data and compute the indicators now, or proceed with a qualitative interpretation framework using the indicators you’ve seen before?
