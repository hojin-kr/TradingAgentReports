I attempted to fetch AAPL data to compute the indicators, but I’m seeing a backend issue:

- Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory') from get_YFin_data
- I retried with the same parameters, but the error persists

What this means: the data retrieval service is currently unavailable or misconfigured on my side. I can retry automatically for a short period, but if the service remains down, I won’t be able to generate the actual indicator values right now. In that case, I can still provide the indicator plan and a detailed framework for how I would interpret them once data is available, and I can proceed with an example using a generic interpretation if you’d like.

Proposed next steps
- Option A (preferred): I retry fetching AAPL data for 2025-04-01 to 2025-10-23 and then compute the indicators. I’ll deliver a full, nuanced report with a final table of findings.
- Option B: If you have a CSV or a different data source you want me to use, you can share it and I’ll run the indicators against that data.
- Option C: If you want a high-level framework now (without live data), I’ll provide an 8-indicator setup and a detailed interpretation guide you can apply once data is restored.

Indicator plan (up to 8 indicators) for AAPL, chosen for complementary signals and broad applicability
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for filtering entries in a market that shows persistent directional bias.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark and confirmation (golden/death cross context). Helps distinguish whether moves are likely to be sustained or pullbacks within a larger trend.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum; helps identify quick shifts and potential entry points when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd: Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line; useful for identifying shifts in momentum that may precede price moves.
- macds: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD help trigger trade considerations and reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- macdh: MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences; complements MACD/macd signal in confirming momentum shifts.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold context and potential reversals; useful in confirming entries when price trend is supported by RSI behavior.
- atr: Volatility gauge for risk management (stop placement, position sizing); helps adapt risk measures to current market volatility.

Why this set is suitable in general for AAPL (late 2025 context, once data is available)
- It combines trend filters (50/200 SMA with 10 EMA for quick momentum context), momentum signals (MACD family and RSI) to capture both direction and strength of moves, and a volatility measure (ATR) to ground risk controls. This mix provides a balanced view that works across trending, range-bound, and mixed-market conditions typical for large-cap tech stocks around major product launches or earnings cycles.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report analyzing current trend direction, momentum strength, potential entry/exit setups, risk management considerations, and scenario analysis (bullish, bearish, and neutral cases).
- A concise, decision-ready interpretation that explicitly notes confirmations and conflicts between indicators.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the key indicators, what they signal, and how to use them.

Please let me know which option you’d prefer:
- I can keep retrying the data fetch now and proceed with the full analysis as soon as it succeeds (Option A).
- Or you can provide an alternative data source (Option B).
- Or I can give you the indicator framework and interpretation guide right now (Option C), and run the calculations as soon as data is available.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A, I’ll retry the data fetch and return with the full, detailed report and the final Markdown table as soon as the data is retrieved.
