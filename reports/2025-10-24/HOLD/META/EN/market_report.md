I tried to fetch META data with get_YFin_data for 2024-10-24 to 2025-10-24, but the backend returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). I re-tried with the same parameters and encountered the same issue. It looks like a data-fetching environment problem rather than an META-specific issue. I can proceed in two ways:

- Wait and retry the data fetch now, so I can compute the indicators and provide a detailed, data-driven trend report.
- Or proceed with a prepared indicator framework (the 8 indicators below) and generate the analysis as soon as the data becomes available, so you have a ready-to-run plan.

In the meantime, here is a well-rounded set of indicators tailored for META, designed to yield complementary insights without redundancy. The goal is to support trend confirmation, momentum shifts, and volatility/risk management.

Selected indicators (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend and acts as dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming the overarching market regime (bullish vs bearish) and for golden/death cross context.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Provides a responsive read on short-term momentum and potential entry timing; pair with longer averages to filter noise.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum indicator signaling potential trend changes via crossovers and divergence.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoothing of MACD; crossovers with the MACD line can trigger signals; helps reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes the gap between MACD and its signal; useful for gauging momentum strength and spotting early divergences.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator highlighting overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; watch for divergences and cross-check with trend.
- atr: Average True Range. Measures volatility; essential for setting stop levels, position sizing, and adjusting risk as market volatility shifts.

Why these are suitable for META right now
- Trend context: META often trades under evolving sentiment driven by ad demand, AI initiatives, and platform changes. The 50SMA/200SMA pair gives a robust framework to assess whether the stock is in a longer-term uptrend or downtrend, helping you align entries with the prevailing regime.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD components (macd, macds, macdh) provide layered momentum signals. RSI adds an independent momentum check to help identify overextension or potential reversals, which is helpful when market conditions shift rapidly.
- Risk management: ATR offers a practical handle on volatility, enabling dynamic risk controls as META’s price action expands or contracts.

How I would use these indicators together (high-level)
- Trend filter: If price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA, bias toward long-side plays; if below, bias toward short-side or caution on longs.
- Momentum alignment: Look for MACD line crossing above its signal and MACD histogram turning positive, with RSI moving away from extremes but not in overbought territory, to validate a momentum-led entry.
- Neuro-discipline with volatility: Use ATR to adjust stop placement and position sizing; rising ATR suggests wider stops and potentially larger position sizing if you’re trend-following with conviction.
- Entry/exit timing: Use close_10_ema as a quicker trigger for potential entries when aligned with MACD and RSI signals, while ensuring the broader trend is favorable per the SMA framework.

Proposed plan for next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now. Once successful, I’ll:
  - Compute the 8 indicators listed above for META over the requested window.
  - Provide a detailed, nuanced trend report showing current alignment (trend, momentum, volatility).
  - Include a practical set of actionable signals and risk controls tailored to META’s recent behavior.
  - Append a Markdown table summarizing key findings and how to interpret signals.

- If you’d prefer to move forward immediately with the framework (without waiting for data fetch), I can generate a structured interpretation guide and a sample workflow you can follow once the data is available. Then I’ll plug in META’s actual numbers as soon as the fetch succeeds.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with the indicator framework and a plan you can use right away?

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and usage
- close_50_sma | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Use to gauge mid-term trend; confirm with longer-term SMA
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms overall regime; watch for golden/death cross contexts
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum, potential entry point | Flag quick shifts; filter with longer averages to reduce noise
- macd | Momentum trend changes | Look for crossovers with macds and divergences for signal confirmation
- macds | MACD signal smoothing | Cross with macd for triggering trades; helps reduce false positives
- macdh | Momentum strength visualization | Use with macd/macds to assess momentum magnitude and divergences
- rsi | Momentum strength and reversal clues | Watch for overbought/oversold and divergences; cross-check with trend
- atr | Volatility and risk management | Set stops and adjust position sizes based on current volatility

If you want me to proceed with the data fetch now, say “retry data fetch,” and I’ll attempt again and then deliver a complete, data-backed trend report with the 8 indicators.
