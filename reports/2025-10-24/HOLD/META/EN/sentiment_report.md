Thanks for the nudge. I hit an infrastructure error when attempting to fetch Reddit stock news for META on 2025-10-24. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have fresh Reddit data to pull in right now.

Here are the best options to move forward, and what I can do in each case:

Option A — Retry now
- I can retry the Reddit stock info fetch immediately and then proceed with a full, data-driven analysis once it succeeds. If it fails again, I’ll switch to the fallback plan below.

Option B — Proceed with a structured draft now
- I can start a comprehensive long-form META analysis based on a solid framework (social sentiment signals, recent news catalysts, and typical drivers) and clearly label data gaps. I’ll fill in the live data as soon as the Reddit tool works, and then update the report accordingly.

Option C — Use alternative sources (if you’re open)
- If you’re okay with me using other available sources (e.g., public news summaries, earnings notes, regulatory updates, or other social platforms) while we wait for the Reddit tool, I can deliver a near-term analysis and then refine it with the Reddit signals once the tool is back.

What I can deliver right now (without the Reddit feed)
- A robust analysis framework you can act on, including:
  - Daily sentiment tracking plan (how I’ll categorize posts as positive/neutral/negative, and how I’ll weight signals).
  - Key themes likely to impact META over the next week (advertising trends, AI/ML product updates, user growth, privacy/regulatory pressure, metaverse strategy, Threads adoption, competition with X/TikTok, etc.).
  - Short-term catalysts to watch (e.g., potential earnings commentary from META, product launches, regulatory developments).
  - Trader-focused implications (volatility expectations, risk exposures, and potential trade ideas depending on sentiment shifts).
  - A Markdown table template with the key points to organize the final report.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, I suggest: Option A (retry now) so I can incorporate the latest Reddit sentiment data and deliver a complete long report with the required Markdown table at the end. If you prefer, I can start with the analysis framework now (Option B) and then drop in the Reddit signals as soon as the data tool is functioning again.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or should I proceed with the draft framework and structure the report around the general sentiment and recent META news?
