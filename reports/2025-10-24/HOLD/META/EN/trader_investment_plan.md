Decision: HOLD META.

Rationale
- Near-term risks dominate: sizable AI-related capex (Hyperion), ongoing restructuring, energy costs, and opex weigh on margins before clear ROI benefits materialize. Ad-market softness and regulatory costs add downside pressure in the coming quarters.
- Long-run setup remains credible: a scalable AI compute moat, cross-platform data advantages, and potential monetization lift from AI-enabled ads, formats, and commerce keep a favorable long-term thesis.
- No definitive near-term ROI inflection yet across regions/formats, so a Buy now could be premature and a Sell could be overly aggressive. Hold preserves capital and optionality while awaiting clearer ROI milestones.

Monitoring plan (to upgrade or exit if needed)
- ROI and monetization signals: RoAS by region/format, ARPU per user, uptake of AI-powered ad formats, cross-platform engagement metrics.
- Infra and cost signals: Hyperion compute efficiency, data-center utilization, energy costs, and amortization versus incremental revenue lift.
- Macro/regulatory signals: ad demand trends and evolving privacy/compliance costs that could impact monetization velocity.
- Event-driven triggers:
  - Upgrade to Buy if ROI metrics show sustained, multi-region RoAS uplift and margin stabilization across consecutive prints.
  - Trim or exit toward Sell if ROI misses expectations and margins worsen, or if regulatory cost headwinds escalate meaningfully.

Risk controls and tactical notes
- Maintain core exposure with tighter risk controls (e.g., ATR-based sizing, tighter stops, potential collar).
- Consider staged add-ons on meaningful positive ROI prints; consider hedges or trims on disappointing prints to preserve capital.

If youâ€™d like, I can pull live indicators (8-indicator framework: 50SMA, 200SMA, 10EMA, MACD, MACD signal, MACD histogram, RSI, ATR) to generate a current regime read and concrete entry/exit templates aligned to the hold stance.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
