Thanks for your patience. I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based stock news for GOOGL, but the Reddit data tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError). I can’t retrieve today’s Reddit-specific sentiment data for GOOGL right now. I can either retry, switch to an alternative data source you approve, or proceed with a high-quality framework and a best-effort analysis using available context and typical sentiment drivers.

Options I can offer right away
- Retry now: I can try the Reddit data tool again in the next cycle if you want me to attempt another fetch.
- Alternative data approach: I can build a comprehensive long-form report using a structured framework that doesn't rely on Reddit for real-time data (e.g., I can rely on general sentiment drivers, recent Alphabet news summaries, and established market themes). You’d get a thorough, trader-oriented analysis with clear hypotheses, even if some day-by-day sentiment isn’t populated from Reddit specifically.
- Framework-ready report: I can produce a detailed report skeleton right now, with explicit sections, methodology, and placeholders for sentiment by day. Once the data fetch is working, I can drop in the actual numbers and updates and append a final Markdown table.

If you’d like the framework now, here’s what I will deliver (and I can fill in the data as soon as Reddit data is accessible):

What the forthcoming long report will include
- Executive snapshot
  - TL;DR sentiment trend for GOOGL over the past week
  - Key drivers observed in social chatter and recent company news
  - Implications for traders (short, intermediate, long horizon)

- Social media sentiment analysis (past 7 days)
  - Daily sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Volume and velocity metrics (posting frequency, engagement spikes)
  - Top recurring themes (AI/Gemini, cloud, ads, YouTube, regulatory risk, privacy, data security)
  - Notable crowd sentiment patterns (e.g., peaks around product announcements, earnings, policy/regulatory news)

- News and events roundup (past 7 days)
  - Summary of major company announcements, partnerships, product updates, earnings-related chatter
  - Regulatory and antitrust context that could influence Alphabet
  - Comparative sentiment between company-owned sources and third-party coverage

- Thematic digest and implications
  - AI and cloud strategy signals
  - Advertising market context and YouTube monetization
  - Regulatory risk and political considerations
  - Competitive dynamics (AWS/Azure competition, IPO/tech peers)
  - Investor sentiment clues (risk-on vs risk-off signals)

- Price action and risk framing
  - Short-term technical read on GOOGL (support/resistance zones, volume patterns)
  - Sentiment-to-price hypotheses and potential catalysts
  - Tail-risk events and hedging considerations

- Trader-oriented insights and scenarios
  - If sentiment strengthens on AI/cloud wins: potential long tilt with triggers
  - If regulatory risk intensifies: potential hedges or cautious stance
  - If ad market softness emerges: risk-off considerations and downside cushions

- Methodology notes
  - Data sources, limitations, and how I interpret sentiment signals
  - How I would compute day-by-day sentiment and themes when data becomes available

- Final deliverable format
  - A comprehensive narrative with bullet-point insights and caveats
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing key takeaways, risks, catalysts, and recommended actions

Proposed action now
- Tell me which path you prefer:
  1) Retry fetching Reddit data now (I’ll trigger another attempt immediately).
  2) Proceed with the framework-based report now (you’ll get a detailed analysis with placeholders, ready to be filled in as soon as data comes in).
  3) Provide a different data source or share data you want me to analyze (e.g., you paste sentiment summaries or provide a CSV).

If you’d like, I can proceed with option 2 right away and deliver the full framework, plus a ready-to-populate Markdown table for the end. Just say “Proceed with the framework” and I’ll generate it. Alternatively, tell me to retry the Reddit fetch now.
