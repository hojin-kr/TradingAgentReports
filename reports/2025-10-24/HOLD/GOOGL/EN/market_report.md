I attempted to fetch Yahoo Finance data for GOOGL (2024-10-24 to 2025-10-24) but encountered a data retrieval error: FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory. This appears to be an environment issue with the data backend right now. I can retry the data pull immediately, or we can proceed with a robust indicator framework and fill in the trend specifics once data is available. Below is a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) tailored for a large-cap tech name like GOOGL, along with rationale and usage notes. If you’d like, I can retry fetching data right after this.

Recommended indicator set (max 8) for GOOGL
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: The 50-day simple moving average.
  - Why relevant: Provides the medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm whether price is in a broader uptrend or downtrend.
  - How to use: Look for price above/below the 50SMA as a trend backdrop; use in conjunction with shorter-term signals to avoid late entries.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: The 200-day simple moving average.
  - Why relevant: Long-term trend benchmark; important for identifying secular uptrends vs secular drawdowns.
  - How to use: Watch for golden cross (price or shorter MA crossing above 200SMA) or death cross signals; use as a strategic, higher-timeframe filter.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: The 10-period exponential moving average.
  - Why relevant: Highly responsive to recent price moves; captures shifts in near-term momentum.
  - How to use: Useful for quick entry/exit cues when aligned with longer-term trend (e.g., price above 50SMA and 200SMA); beware of noise in choppy markets.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs (MACD line vs. signal dynamics).
  - Why relevant: Signals trend changes and momentum shifts; helpful in confirming breakouts or pullbacks within a trend.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossovers with the signal line, and note divergences with price. Use alongside trend checks from moving averages.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: The EMA-smoothed MACD line (the signal line).
  - Why relevant: Smoother confirmation of momentum shifts; reduces false positives from raw MACD.
  - How to use: Trade signals are typically triggered when MACD crosses MACDS; confirm with price action and other indicators.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: The gap between MACD and its signal (momentum strength).
  - Why relevant: Quick visualization of momentum acceleration or deceleration; useful for spotting early divergence or weakening trends.
  - How to use: Rising histogram suggests strengthening momentum; shrinking/negative histogram can warn of waning momentum or potential reversals. Combine with trend and RSI for confirmation.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: Momentum speed/velocity; overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why relevant: Provides context on how aggressively prices have moved within the current trend; can show potential reversals when readings diverge from price trends.
  - How to use: Default thresholds around 70 (overbought) and 30 (oversold). In strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; look for bearish/bullish divergences and corroborate with MACD and price/MA context.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it measures: Average True Range; a volatility gauge.
  - Why relevant: Captures current market volatility, essential for risk management and position sizing; helps set dynamic stops.
  - How to use: Use a multiple of ATR to place stop-loss levels or trailing stops; higher ATR suggests wider stops and risk adjustments; lower ATR suggests tighter risk controls.

How these indicators fit together (trading framework)
- Trend context (50SMA, 200SMA, 10 EMA): Use 50SMA and 200SMA to establish whether the dominant backdrop is bullish or bearish. The 10-EMA helps you gauge near-term momentum within that backdrop.
- Momentum confirmation (MACD family, RSI): MACD crossovers and histogram shifts provide momentum confirmation or warnings when the price is attempting to break from the trend. RSI informs about extreme conditions and potential reversals, with divergence as a leading signal in the right context.
- Risk management (ATR): Always tie position sizing and stop placement to ATR to adapt to current volatility, reducing risk during high-volatility periods and protecting profits when volatility contracts.
- Confirmation discipline: Do not act on a single signal. Look for alignment across:
  - Price action and MA framework (price above/below 50SMA and 200SMA with a clear trend).
  - MACD/macd/macdh momentum signals that align with the price trend.
  - RSI not showing conflicting extremes without corroboration.
  - ATR-based stop adjustments to control risk.

Notes and caveats
- Data availability: I currently don’t have a successful data pull for GOOGL in the requested window. Once the data is back, I will compute the indicators and produce a detailed, data-driven trend report with live signals and a practical trading plan.
- Market context: GOOGL (Alphabet) is a large-cap growth/tech stock often driven by earnings, AI announcements, and regulatory news. Indicators should be used as part of a broader framework that includes event risk and macro context.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now and, once successful, generate a detailed trend analysis using the above indicators, including entry/exit considerations and a market-context narrative.
- Alternatively, if you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative framework (no numeric readouts) and outline scenarios for current market conditions with this indicator set.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with the qualitative framework and wait for the data to return?

Markdown table: Key indicators overview
