I attempted to fetch PLTR data and compute the requested indicators, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t retrieve the PLTR price history (2024-10-24 to 2025-10-24) or compute the stockstats indicators at the moment. If you’d like, I can retry now or retry after a short interval, or we can adjust the date range or data source.

In the meantime, here is a carefully selected set of up to 8 indicators that would provide complementary insights for PLTR given its typical market behavior as a tech/data company (often volatile with identifiable trend phases). This mix aims to balance trend, momentum, volatility, and volume-context signals without redundancy.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the prevailing trend when combined with shorter-term signals.
- close_200_sma
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark; can reveal major regime shifts (golden/death cross setups) and help filter shorter-term signals.
- close_10_ema
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum indicator; useful for spotting quick shifts and potential entry points, particularly in fast-moving moves.
- macd
  - Why: Momentum flavor and trend-change signal via the difference of EMAs; useful for spotting shifts when price is moving decisively.
- macds
  - Why: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD add confirmation to potential entries or exits.
- macdh
  - Why: MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and divergence tendencies; helpful to gauge momentum acceleration or weakening.
- rsi
  - Why: Momentum gauge with clear overbought/oversold thresholds; divergence insights can surface ahead of price reversals.
- atr
  - Why: Measures market volatility; informs position sizing, stop placement, and risk management in PLTR’s often volatile swings.

Notes on interpretation and how to use them together
- Trend framing: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to determine the broader trend. If price is above both and the 50 is above the 200 (a bullish alignment), prefer long entries when other filters align. If price is below both with a bearish cross (50 below 200), look for weakness-driven setups or hedges.
- Momentum confirmation: Use macd, macds, and macdh together. A MACD positive crossover with MACD line crossing above the MACD signal line and a rising macdh histogram strengthens the case for a bullish move; the reverse indicates potential downside pressure.
- Momentum vs. overextension: RSI helps avoid chasing extremes that aren’t backed by trend. In a strong uptrend, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; rely on MACD and price action in addition to RSI to avoid false signals.
- Volatility context: ATR provides a real-time sense of how much PLTR is likely to move, which is essential for setting stops and position sizes during high-volatility periods common in growth/tech days.
- Relative positioning: If price is testing a support near the 50 SMA or 200 SMA while RSI is oversold but MACD shows positive momentum, it could be a higher-probability bounce setup; conversely, resistance near moving averages with overbought RSI and deteriorating MACD momentum may favor exits or shorts.

What I’ll do next
- If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data immediately or specify a different date range or source. Once I have the data, I’ll:
  - Compute the 8 indicators listed above for PLTR.
  - Provide a detailed, nuanced trend report with: current trend direction, momentum strength/duration, volatility context, potential support/resistance zones, and concrete trading takeaways (entry, stop, target ideas) aligned with the indicators.
  - Include a concise conclusion and a tidy, readable table of key points.

Would you like me to retry fetching PLTR data now, or would you prefer a different date range or data source? If you want me to retry, I’ll proceed and then deliver the full, data-driven report with the indicators above.
