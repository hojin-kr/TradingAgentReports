Sorry — I hit an internal error when calling the Reddit stock info tool (FileNotFoundError). That backend issue prevented me from pulling the latest social media data right now. I can retry the tool in a moment, or we can proceed with a plan for the full analysis and fill in the data as soon as the tool comes back up.

Here’s how I propose we proceed and what I’ll deliver once the data fetch works:

What I will deliver (full long-form report)
- Executive snapshot: A concise read on PLTR’s sentiment and public perception over the past week, with a focus on notable shifts around any news, product announcements, or contracts.
- Daily sentiment trend: A day-by-day breakdown of sentiment (bullish, bearish, neutral) with a short note on what drove the change each day (e.g., a Reddit post, a tweet, a rumor, a news item).
- Top themes and drivers: The most common topics driving sentiment (AI capabilities, Palantir Foundry, government C2/contract activity, partnerships, pricing/contract concerns, competition, data privacy/regulatory considerations).
- Notable posts and narratives: A synthesis of representative posts (paraphrased, not quoted verbatim) that capture the mood, risk aversion, or excitement; identification of any influencer signals or highly upvoted/reposted items.
- News and catalysts: Summary of relevant company news from the past week (contracts, earnings hints, product launches, regulatory/regulatory updates, leadership commentary) and how they align with social sentiment.
- Price/sentiment relationship: If available, a quick look at whether sentiment spikes align with price moves (short-term correlation, e.g., intra-day or next-day moves).
- Risk and opportunities: Practical takeaways for traders (e.g., signals that sentiment is turning more cautious ahead of an event, or bullish momentum around AI-related announcements).
- Trader-oriented implications: Tactical ideas (entry/exit hints with caveats, risk controls, timeframes) based on sentiment momentum vs. news catalysts.

Data considerations and how I’ll handle them
- I’ll extract sentiment on PLTR from social media signals (Reddit, and other sources if available) and map it to the date range you specify (past 7–10 days, centered around 2025-10-24).
- I’ll annotate each data point with the driving factor (e.g., “AI product demo,” “contract win,” “regulatory concern”) to give precise context.
- I’ll highlight any data gaps or anomalies (e.g., low sample days, potential bot-driven spikes) and note how they affect interpretation.
- I’ll end with a Markdown table organizing the key points for quick reference.

Proposed short-term next steps
- If you’d like me to proceed now, I’ll retry the Reddit data call as soon as the tooling allows and then generate the full report with an appended Markdown table.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a structured draft based on publicly known context (without the live Reddit feed), but that would be less precise for daily sentiment.

Please let me know:
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch immediately, or would you prefer I proceed with the plan and deliver the draft structure while we wait for the tool to come back up?
- If you’re okay with waiting, I’ll run the data pull as soon as the tool is accessible and deliver the full report with the final Markdown table appended.
