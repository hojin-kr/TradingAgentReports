I attempted to fetch Reddit stock data for SPY for the dates you requested, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (the calls failed). Here’s what happened and how we can proceed:

What happened
- Parallel fetch attempts for SPY on 2025-10-24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18 all errored with FileNotFoundError.
- A direct call for 2025-10-24 also errored with the same message.
- This appears to be an environment/tool issue rather than data absence.

Options to proceed
1) Retry now (preferred if you want Reddit sentiment data)
   - I can retry a single-date fetch first (e.g., 2025-10-24) to verify if the tool is back up, then expand to the rest if successful.

2) Proceed without Reddit data for now
   - I can still craft a comprehensive long-form report focusing on:
     - Recent SPY-related price action and macro/context over the past week
     - Implications for traders (risk, rotation, liquidity, expected ranges)
     - Potential signals from other sources (if you have access to them)
   - Note: This would exclude Reddit-specific sentiment data and its day-by-day granularity.

3) Alternative data sources
   - If you have access to additional sentiment feeds (Twitter/X, Stocktwits, etc.), share summaries or allow me to fetch via an available tool, and I’ll integrate them.
   - Otherwise, I can propose a framework using publicly observable indicators (VIX, SPY options skew, ETF flows, major macro headlines) to infer sentiment.

What I can do next
- If you want me to retry, say “Retry SPY Reddit fetch.” I’ll attempt a single-date fetch first (2025-10-24) and report back.
- If you’d prefer to proceed without Reddit data, say “Proceed without Reddit,” and I’ll deliver the long-form report with a complete, data-grounded analysis using alternative signals.
- If you want a hybrid approach, I can draft the report now focusing on price action, macro context, and news headlines, and then plug in Reddit sentiment as soon as the tool is available.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the non-Reddit-based analysis?
