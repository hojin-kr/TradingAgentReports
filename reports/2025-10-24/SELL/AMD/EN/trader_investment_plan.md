Recommendation: SELL AMD

Rationale (aligned with the proposed plan)
- Bear case credibility: Nvidia’s dominance in AI compute remains a meaningful hurdle. AMD’s data-center growth hinges on favorable, multi-year ASPs, broad ROCm adoption, and a faster data-center AI cycle—all of which are uncertain and not guaranteed.
- Margin and moat concerns: Even with a multi-lane growth story (data-center GPU/CPU-GPU synergy, ROCm moat), the risk of margin compression and mixed data-center demand normalization weighs on the tape. ROCm adoption remains a hurdle, and competitive dynamics could prevent durable pricing power.
- Cyclicality and macro risk: Core gaming/PC demand remains sensitive to macro shifts. AI capex timing and enterprise IT budgets could slow, potentially hurting AMD more than peers if the AI cycle stalls or overshoots expectations.
- Stock price reflection: The upside from AI tailwinds is partially priced in; without clear, verifiable data-center ASP durability and ROCm traction, the risk-reward remains skewed to the downside.

Actionable plan (pragmatic risk controls)
- If you’re already long AMD: trim aggressively. Target a 40–60% reduction in exposure from current levels, staged to avoid market impact.
- Risk controls:
  - Stop loss: implement an ATR-based stop (roughly 1.5–2.0x the latest 14-day ATR) to guard against sharp downside moves.
  - Position sizing: cap AMD exposure to a modest 3–5% of total portfolio per name, adjusted for overall tech concentration.
  - Hedging: consider a protective put or a collar to maintain upside participation while limiting downside; fund the hedge with a small covered call if appropriate.
- If you’re neutral or lightly exposed: avoid building a new long on dispersion of upside unless clear, verifiable catalysts emerge (e.g., strong ROCm traction metrics, sustained higher ASPs, and a durable data-center growth cadence).
- Catalysts and monitoring:
  - Hyperscaler commentary, bookings, and AMD data-center backlog signals.
  - ROCm ecosystem traction: workloads supported, customer wins, and depth of hyperscaler adoption.
  - Data-center ASP stability/expansion and gross margins progress.
  - Competitive moves (NVIDIA/Intel) and macro policy/geopolitical developments affecting capex.
- Exit strategy and re-entry triggers:
  - Reweight toward constructive if AMD demonstrates durable ROCm traction, credible data-center backlog growth, and sustained margin improvement, confirmed by price-action breakout and fundamental catalysts.
  - If signals deteriorate (data-center demand softening, ROCm traction stalling, or margins failing to improve), tighten risk controls or exit further.

Learning and risk-aware posture
- The plan emphasizes corroborating catalysts across multiple axes (product cadence, software moat, data-center mix, and macro). The recommended path is to protect capital until durable, verifiable improvements materialize; otherwise, stay on the sidelines or reduce exposure.

Bottom line
- Given the uncertainties and the potential downside risks, a cautious Sell stance with disciplined risk management is warranted. If you want to pursue a hedged or tactically lighter approach, I can tailor a gradual trim or a collar strategy aligned with your risk tolerance and portfolio.
