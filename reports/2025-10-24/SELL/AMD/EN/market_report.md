I attempted to fetch AMD data for the requested range, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source backend is currently unavailable or misconfigured. I can retry fetching the data, try a shorter date range, or proceed with a framework-based analysis that you can use once the data is available. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a robust indicator framework (8 indicators) tailored for AMD’s typical market dynamics and a detailed, nuanced plan for interpreting them.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- boll_ub

Why these indicators are suitable for AMD (current market context)
- A combination of mid- and long-term trend, with a responsive short-term move:
  - close_50_sma and close_200_sma provide dynamic trend context and identify potential support/resistance zones. They help distinguish whether AMD is in a longer-term uptrend, downtrend, or range-bound mode.
  - close_10_ema adds a nimble, short-term signal that can capture momentum shifts ahead of the slower SMAs, useful for early entries or exits in a volatile semi market.
- Momentum confirmation and potential reversal signals:
  - macd and macds (MACD line and MACD signal) help identify momentum changes and crossovers that may precede trend shifts, which is valuable around product-cycle events or AI/compute demand cycles.
  - rsi adds a momentum read on overbought/oversold conditions, helping to flag potential reversals when price momentum is stretched, especially useful in choppy or range-bound periods.
- Volatility and breakout/range context:
  - boll (middle band) and boll_ub (upper band) provide a view of price behavior relative to a volatility-adjusted baseline. The interaction of price with the upper band can indicate breakout pressure in strong uptrends, while price bouncing off the middle or lower bands can signal continuation or mean-reversion tendencies.
- The combination of these indicators gives a well-rounded view:
  - Trend direction (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA)
  - Momentum strength and direction (MACD, MACD signal, RSI)
  - Volatility context and breakout potential (Bollinger bands)

How the indicators complement each other (interpretation framework)
- Trend confirmation and timing:
  - When price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA, with a rising 10EMA, the setup favors long entries if MACD line crosses above MACD signal and RSI remains non-extreme above 50.
  - If price is between 50SMA and 200SMA or crossing them, rely more on MACD/macd signals and RSI levels to avoid false breakouts.
- Momentum vs trend:
  - A bullish MACD crossover with a rising RSI above 50 reinforces continuation signals in uptrends implied by SMAs.
  - If MACD is bearish while price remains above SMAs (divergence), expect potential consolidation or a pullback; watch how price interacts with the Bollinger bands for volatility-driven moves.
- Volatility-driven entries/exits:
  - Price touching or breaking the upper Bollinger band with MACD strengthening and RSI not yet overbought can indicate a healthy breakout in a strong uptrend.
  - Price approaching or crossing the middle band after a period of sideways action paired with MACD histogram expansion can signal a momentum re-acceleration or a trend restart.

What signals to monitor (practical cues)
- Cross of price above/below 50SMA and 200SMA: trend alignment check. Use with MACD crossovers and RSI direction to confirm entries.
- 10EMA crossing or diverging from price: early momentum cue. Use with MACD histogram for confirmation.
- MACD line crossing above/below MACD signal: momentum shift. Prefer when RSI confirms momentum (rising or not in overbought territory).
- RSI crossing above 70 or below 30: potential overbought/oversold; check for divergence with price and cross-check with trend direction from SMAs.
- Price closing near/breaking the upper Bollinger band with widening ATR (volatility context): breakout potential; confirm with MACD strength.
- Price testing the middle Bollinger band after a consolidation: possible mean-reversion or trend restart; look for MACD/RSI confirmation.

Caveats and considerations
- AMD can exhibit fast, news-driven moves around product launches, supply chain updates, or AI/compute demand news. In such periods, speed of signal vs. noise is crucial; the 10EMA helps, but avoid over-trading in low-volume days.
- In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; use SMA trend context and MACD histogram/direction for better fidelity.
- Bollinger bands are most informative when used with other filters (e.g., MACD, RSI). Do not rely on band signals in isolation.

Next steps (once data retrieval is resolved)
- Compute the 8 indicators for AMD over the intended analysis window.
- Generate an integrated interpretation:
  - Trend stance (bullish/bearish/neutral)
  - Momentum strength and likely continuation/dull phase
  - Potential entry/exit zones with risk controls (e.g., stop placement using ATR)
- Provide a concise trading plan with suggested thresholds for entries, exits, and risk management.

Next steps
- I can retry the AMD data fetch now or with a narrower window (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-06-30) if you’d like, or switch to a broader view once the data tool is available.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a hypothetical analysis using these indicators and lay out example signals, but it will be hypothetical until data is loaded.

Would you like me to retry fetching AMD data now, or would you prefer I proceed with a hypothetical, signal-only framework for AMD based on these indicators until the data tool is back up? If you have a preferred date range or another ticker, I can adapt the plan accordingly.
