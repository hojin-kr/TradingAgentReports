# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD faces Nvidia’s dominance and uncertain ROCm traction. Data-center gains depend on several uncertain catalysts, including higher-value ASPs and backlog growth. Until durable momentum and margin lift appear, the risk-reward favors selling or heavy trimming.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: SELL. Confidence: HIGH.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Nvidia leads the AI compute market; AMD’s data-center upside is not assured and may be incremental.
- ROCm adoption remains uncertain; even with open software, enterprise/hyperscaler traction may be slower than hoped, limiting a durable moat.
- Margin risk from potential ASP normalization and macro-driven cycles; data-center mix shifts could weigh on profits.
- Achieving meaningful upside requires multiple favorable outcomes (ROCm traction, steady backlog, higher-value ASPs) that are not guaranteed.
- A cautious stance with risk controls helps preserve capital while staying prepared to participate if clearer durable momentum emerges.

## Risks To Watch
- Data-center demand cycle and hyperscaler bookings for AMD’s backlog.
- Real traction and sustainability of ROCm software adoption in enterprise/workloads.
- Data-center ASP trends and gross margin impact from mix shifts.
- Competitive pressure and pricing moves from Nvidia and peers.
- Macro timing for AI-related capex and broader market conditions.
