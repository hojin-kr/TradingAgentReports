Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock news for AMD on 2025-10-24, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry, or we can proceed with an alternative plan to keep the analysis moving.

Options to proceed
- Retry the Reddit data pull now: I’ll attempt the same AMD Reddit data request again and then begin the full sentiment/news analysis once it returns data.
- Proceed with a partial analysis using available inputs: I can outline the framework, the likely themes to watch, and how traders could interpret sentiment and news, but I won’t have Reddit-specific numbers until the tool succeeds.
- Expand sources (if you have access or another tool): I can incorporate additional social media and news sources beyond Reddit (e.g., X/Twitter chatter, StockTwits, major news outlets) to triangulate sentiment in the past week.

What I can deliver now (plan)
If you’d like me to proceed with the plan (either after a retry or with alternate sources), I will produce a comprehensive long report focused on AMD, covering:
- Social sentiment analysis
  - Overall sentiment trend over the past 7 days (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Daily sentiment trajectory with notable spikes
  - Top topics driving sentiment (e.g., AI/accelerators, gaming GPU demand, supply chain, device launches)
  - Key post-level signals (high-engagement posts, recurring usernames, recurring themes)
- Recent company news and catalysts
  - Any AMD announcements, partnerships, product launches, earnings-related news, or industry developments in the past week
  - How those events align with or counter prevailing sentiment
- Sentiment vs. price/volatility context
  - Correlation between daily sentiment shifts and AMD price or intraday volatility
  - Time-of-day patterns in chatter and potential outsized moves around news events
- Thematic insights and implications for traders
  - Which themes are risk-on vs risk-off for AMD
  - Short-term trading themes (e.g., momentum vs mean-reversion, potential pullbacks after sentiment surges)
  - Longer-term considerations (valuation, AI/data-center demand, competitive positioning)
- Practical takeaways and watchlist
  - Key levels to watch, catalysts to monitor, and probability-weighted scenarios
- Markdown table
  - A concise, at-a-glance summary of the most actionable points

Next steps
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data pull now and proceed with the full report as soon as it returns data?
- Or would you prefer that I start immediately with an analysis based on non-Reddit sources (assuming we can access them) and clearly label any data gaps?

If you choose “retry now,” I’ll run the AMD Reddit data query again and then deliver the complete long-form report with a final Markdown table summarizing the key points.
