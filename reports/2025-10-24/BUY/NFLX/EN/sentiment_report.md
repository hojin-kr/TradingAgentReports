Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to pull the Reddit-based stock news for NFLX on 2025-10-24, but the data tool is returning a FileNotFoundError (and I also retried with the same result). I can either try again later, or proceed using other sources to keep moving on the analysis.

Here are two options. Tell me which you prefer, and I’ll proceed immediately.

Option A — Retry Reddit data now
- I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again for NFLX (ticker: NFLX) for 2025-10-24 (and also consider a nearby window if that date proves problematic).
- If the tool comes back online, I’ll integrate those Reddit signals into the full sentiment/impact analysis and update the final report with a detailed, day-by-day Reddit sentiment narrative.

Option B — Proceed without Reddit data (best-effort, other sources)
- I’ll deliver a comprehensive long-form analysis using available non-Reddit signals (e.g., major news headlines, public company announcements, earnings-related coverage, and general social sentiment from other platforms if available).
- The report will include:
  - Daily sentiment overview (excluding Reddit) and any notable sentiment spikes tied to news or events.
  - Key news events from the past week and their potential impact on NFLX’s trajectory (subs growth, pricing strategy, content strategy, ad-supported plan, competition, regulatory considerations).
  - Thematic sentiment breakdown (e.g., subscriber growth expectations, content quality, platform UX, pricing, ARPU, ad-supported tier performance).
  - Implications for traders/investors: potential catalysts, risk factors, and what to watch next (earnings cadence, user engagement metrics, churn signals, competitive moves).
  - A structured Makrdown table at the end with key takeaways, signal sources, and risk/uncertainty notes.

What I can deliver right away (Option B, since Reddit data is currently unavailable)
- A thorough, source-grounded analysis focusing on:
  - Public news flow about NFLX in the last 7 days
  - Any notable management commentary or guidance
  - Industry context (streaming landscape, advertising model traction, competition with Disney+/Prime Video, etc.)
  - Sentiment trends from the non-Reddit channels I can access (e.g., major media outlets, press coverage, investor commentary)
  - Practical implications for traders (short-term catalysts, risk flags, and potential setups)

If you want me to proceed immediately, say “Proceed with Option B.” If you’d prefer to retry Reddit data first, say “Retry Reddit data now,” and I’ll attempt the pull again and incorporate it as soon as it returns.
