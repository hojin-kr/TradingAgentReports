Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock/news data for NVDA (curr_date 2025-10-24) but the tool returned an internal error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

What this means: the get_reddit_stock_info tool is currently failing on the backend, so I can’t retrieve the Reddit-specific dataset right now.

Options to move forward:
- Retry now: I can try the Reddit data fetch again immediately to see if the issue resolves.
- Alternate approach: Proceed with a thorough NVDA analysis using other sources and publicly available sentiment signals (e.g., press releases, general social media sentiment outside Reddit, recent news). I can structure a comprehensive report and fill in Reddit insights as soon as the tool comes back online.
- Hybrid plan: I draft the full long-form report framework and metrics, and I queue the Reddit data fetch to run in parallel. I’ll integrate Reddit findings the moment the tool works again.

If you’d like, I can proceed with option 2 or 3 right away and keep you updated. In the meantime, here’s how I would structure the eventual long report and the key metrics I’ll track (so you know what to expect once data comes back):

Proposed report structure (NVDA, past week up to 2025-10-24)
- Executive snapshot
  - Short sentiment read vs. price action
  - notable catalysts (AI demand, product launches, chip supply, regulatory/news events)
- Social sentiment analysis (Reddit + other platforms)
  - Daily sentiment score (net positive vs. negative)
  - Post volume and velocity (growth/decay of discussions)
  - Top themes by day (e.g., AI/GPUs, guidance, supply chain, competitors)
  - Signals vs. price/momentum (any leading/lagging patterns)
- News/Elon-like catalysts (recent company and industry news)
  - Key headlines, sources, and potential earnings/forward guidance implications
  - Regulatory or geopolitical risks (if any)
- Market context
  - Sector/AI demand backdrop, competitors, and NVIDIA’s positioning
  - Supply chain considerations (foundry capacity, fab updates)
  - Valuation context and risk factors (policy/regulatory, competition, depreciation of demand)
- Quantitative signals and trade ideas
  - Short-term sentiment-driven signals (e.g., high negative sentiment spike with potential dip buying)
  - Positive sentiment momentum for potential breakout moves
  - Risk considerations and alternative scenarios
- Takeaways for traders/investors
  - Likely near-term catalysts
  - How sentiment aligns or diverges from fundamentals
  - Suggested action framework (BUY/HOLD/SELL) with caveats

Appendix: Markdown table (key points)
- The final report will include a table summarizing:
  - Date
  - Daily sentiment score
  - Post volume
  - Major themes
  - News catalysts
  - Implied market reaction

Next steps: Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or should I proceed with the alternative plan and deliver the full analysis (without Reddit data for the moment) with a placeholder section for Reddit insights to be filled when the tool is back online?
