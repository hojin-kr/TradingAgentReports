I attempted to fetch NVDA data with get_YFin_data, but the call failed with a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). I can retry the data retrieval right away, or proceed with a strategy-focused framework now and run the data pull once the service is available. Please tell me which you prefer. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators and a detailed plan for NVDA, tailored to its typical market behavior as a high-volatility tech stock.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale for the selected indicators
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average): Highlights the medium-term trend direction and acts as a dynamic support/resistance level. Useful for confirming the prevailing trend and filtering signals from shorter-term oscillators.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average): Provides a long-term trend benchmark. Helps assess macro directional bias (e.g., bullish if price is above the 200 SMA) and can identify major trend shifts (golden/death cross considerations). Important for NVDA where long-term momentum often drives investment decisions.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average): A responsive short-term trend and momentum gauge. Helpful to catch quick shifts in price action, which is valuable for NVDA’s rapid reactions to news and earnings.
- macd (MACD line): Momentum indicator based on EMA differences. Signals potential trend changes via crossovers and divergences, useful for NVDA’s often-volatile environment when paired with other filters.
- macds (MACD Signal): The EMA of the MACD line. Crossovers with MACD provide more robust entry/exit cues, reducing false positives in choppy periods.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. In NVDA’s strong trends, RSI can stay extended; use it in conjunction with trend direction (from SMAs) to spot high-probability reversals.
- boll (Bollinger Middle, i.e., 20-period SMA): Baseline for volatility bands; helps identify consolidation and breakout zones when used with bands.
- atr (Average True Range): Measures volatility. Useful for setting dynamic stop-loss levels and position sizing, especially for NVDA where volatility can spike around earnings or product/market news.

How to use these indicators together (a concise framework)
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to determine the broader trend. If price remains above both, NVDA is in a bullish regime; if below, bearish. Look for alignment with the 10_ema for recent tempo.
- Momentum confirmation: Use macd and macds to confirm momentum shifts. A MACD cross of the MACD above the MACD signal (and rising histogram) strengthens a bullish signal, particularly when supported by price above the 50/200 SMAs.
- Momentum exhaustion / pullbacks: RSI can help identify overbought conditions during uptrends and potential oversold levels during downtrends. In strong uptrends, expect RSI to remain elevated; cross-check with MACD and price location relative to the 50 SMA.
- Volatility and risk controls: Boll (middle) plus ATR give a sense of current volatility regime. A tightening Boll (lower band approaching the middle) might precede a breakout; ATR can guide stop placement and position sizing to adapt to volatility.
- Entry/exit discipline: Favor entries when price is above key moving averages, MACD confirms momentum, RSI is not in extreme overbought territory (or shows a constructive divergence), and ATR is trending higher (rising volatility can support breakout moves). Use ATR to set initial stops rather than fixed dollar amounts in NVDA’s dynamic environment.

Expected insights once data is retrieved
- A current read on whether NVDA is in a bullish, bearish, or range-bound regime based on SMA alignment.
- Momentum confirmation via MACD/macds crossovers and histogram behavior, helping to distinguish fresh moves from mere noise.
- RSI-level context to assess the likelihood of a continuation versus a pullback, especially around earnings or major announcements.
- Volatility context through Bollinger middle and ATR values to gauge breakout potential and risk management levels.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data with get_YFin_data immediately. If you’d like me to proceed, I’ll re-run the data pull for NVDA and then generate a full indicators report using the 8 indicators above, followed by a detailed, data-backed trend interpretation.
- If you prefer, I can also run a parallel check with get_stockstats_indicators_report for each indicator after the data is available to provide a concise signal summary.

Markdown table: key points about the selected indicators for NVDA
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for NVDA | Ideal signal notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance | Confirm trend with price relative to 50 SMA; align with 10_ema for momentum | Price above 50 SMA with bullish momentum signals stronger |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend, major trend state | Assess macro regime; watch for golden/death cross signals | Above 200 SMA supports longer-term bullish stance |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum and shifts | Use for timely entries/exits; filter with longer SMAs | Price crossing above 10_ema in uptrend supports entries |
| macd | MACD Line | Momentum via EMA differences | Look for crossovers with MACD signal and histogram strength | MACD above signal with rising histogram reinforces upmove |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD line | Use crossovers with MACD to trigger signals | MACD line crossing above MACD signal confirmed by price action |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold, momentum strength | Watch for divergences and extreme values; cross-check with trend | RSI trending up but not overbought supports continuation after pullbacks |
| boll | Bollinger Middle | Baseline SMA for volatility context | Track price relative to middle line; use with bands to spot breakouts | Price moving decisively above middle with expanding bands suggests breakout potential |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level for risk management | Set stops and position sizes based on current ATR; adapt to volatility spikes | Rising ATR implies wider stops and potentially larger position sizing |
