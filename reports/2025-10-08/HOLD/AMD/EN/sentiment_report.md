I tried to fetch Reddit sentiment data for AMD for the date range you requested, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError (both for the multi-date parallel call and for the single-date call). I can’t retrieve Reddit-based sentiment data right now. I can either retry shortly, or switch to analyzing AMD using other sources (e.g., other social platforms and public news) if you’re okay with that. Let me know which path you prefer.

What I can do next (two options)
- Option A: Retry Reddit data pull now (or after a short interval) and then compile the full long-form report with day-by-day Reddit sentiment, themes, and implications for traders.
- Option B: Proceed with a comprehensive AMD analysis using alternate sources (public news coverage, earnings commentary, press releases, and general sentiment from other social channels) and clearly label where Reddit data is unavailable. I’ll still structure the report to mirror the Reddit-focused approach and note data gaps.

Proposed plan for the long report (regardless of data source)
- Executive snapshot: Key sentiment drift, current perception among social media users, and headline news drivers affecting AMD as of early October 2025.
- Social sentiment analysis by day (if Reddit data becomes available) or by notable social/news events (if we switch sources): Positive/Neutral/Negative shares, notable spikes, and associated topics (e.g., product launches, earnings, supply chain updates, AI/datacenter demand).
- Top themes and crowd sentiment drivers: GPU/AISC demand commentary, competition (e.g., Intel/NVIDIA dynamics), product roadmap mentions, profitability signals, and any risk flags (pricing pressure, supply chain constraints, capex).
- News flow integration: Summary of recent AMD company news (press releases, partnerships, product announcements, earnings guidance) and how those events map to sentiment shifts.
- Trader-oriented implications: What sentiment trends and news cues imply for risk-on vs risk-off behavior, timing considerations around catalysts, and potential near-term price action signals (breakouts, pullbacks, volatility spikes).
- Risk and caveats: Data gaps, potential biases in social sentiment data, and macro factors that could override micro social signals.
- Concrete takeaways and watchlist signals: If sentiment improves or deteriorates a certain threshold, what action signals would be warranted (e.g., consider hedges, monitor for entry/exit around key catalysts).

What I need from you
- Confirm preferred data sources: Should I proceed with Option A (retry Reddit data) or Option B (proceed with alternative sources)?
- If you opt for Option B, do you want me to pull in any specific sources besides Reddit (e.g., X/Twitter mentions, stock-specific forums, earnings call transcripts, major tech outlets) or should I treat all non-Reddit social/news as a single blended sentiment stream?
- If you want a quick preview, I can deliver a high-level AMD sentiment/News snapshot based on the latest public information and frame the likely implications for traders while we wait for Reddit data to come back.

Note on what I can deliver now
- Without Reddit data, I can still draft the outline and fill in sections that rely on publicly known news and general market context. I will clearly flag where Reddit-specific sentiment is missing and provide expected data fields so we can slot in the Reddit insights as soon as the tool is healthy again.

Appendix: Markdown table (key points and plan)
| Topic | Status / Notes | Data Source | Immediate Trader Implications |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reddit sentiment data pull for AMD (2025-10-02 to 2025-10-08) | Failed due to tool error (FileNotFoundError) | Reddit data tool | Data gap; wait for tool recovery or switch to alternatives; potential timing risk for day-by-day sentiment cues |
| Alternative sentiment sources (if we switch) | Pending confirmation | Non-Reddit social/news | Can provide blended sentiment signal; useful for cross-validation |
| Recent AMD company news (through 2025-10-08) | To be incorporated; needs update | AMD press releases, earnings, outlets | Core catalysts among product/AI/datacenter demand; map to sentiment themes |
| Daily sentiment themes (when data available) | Planned | Reddit or alternative sources | Identify spikes tied to catalysts; inform short-term trading windows |
| Trader-focused takeaways | To be finalized | Integrated data | Entry/exit signals around catalysts, risk assessment, hedging opportunities |

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option A or Option B right away. Just tell me which path to follow, and I’ll pull together the full, structured AMD report with a detailed narrative, sentiment breakdown, and a final Makrdown table summarizing the key takeaways.
