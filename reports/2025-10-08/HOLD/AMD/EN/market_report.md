I attempted to fetch AMD data, but the data retrieval step returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data pull if you’d like, but in the meantime I can still provide a solid, non-data-dependent indicator framework and how I’d apply it to AMD given a typical mid- to long-term trading context. When the data fetch succeeds, I’ll plug in the exact values and refine the insights accordingly.

Proposed 8 indicators for AMD (diverse, complementary, and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for AMD (as of a typical 2025-10-08 context)
- Trend and dynamic support/resistance: The 50 SMA and 200 SMA help identify medium- and long-term trend direction and possible dynamic support or resistance zones. Given AMD’s cyclical nameplate launches and demand sensitivity, aligning entries with a broader trend can improve the odds of a sustainable move rather than a noisy swing.
- Momentum and entry timing: The 10 EMA provides a responsive read on near-term momentum, flagging shifts that may precede larger trend moves. MACD family (macd, macds, macdh) gives a three-layer view of momentum (line crossovers, smoothing, and momentum strength/divergence), which is valuable in a stock that often experiences rapid shifts around earnings or AI-related news.
- Risk management and volatility context: ATR offers a clear sense of current volatility, helping to size positions and place stops adaptively—useful for AMD’s typically volatile reaction to quarterly results or AI infrastructure news.
- Momentum extremes and potential reversals: RSI adds a momentum filter to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences, which can be particularly informative when AMD is extending in one direction on strong earnings or guidance.

How to interpret and combine signals (practical workflow for AMD)
- Trend confirmation: 
  - If price is above both the 50 SMA and 200 SMA and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA (positive trend alignment), bias toward long entries when MACD lines are bullish and RSI is not in extreme overbought territory.
  - If price is below both moving averages or the 50 SMA has just crossed below the 200 SMA (bearish alignment), bias toward short entries or cautious long entries with tight risk controls if momentum signals turn favorable.
- Entry timing with momentum:
  - Look for a bullish MACD cross (MACD line above MACD Signal) accompanied by a rising MACD Histogram (macdh has positive, increasing values) and price holding above the 10 EMA for a potential near-term entry.
  - Conversely, a bearish MACD cross with a decreasing macdh and price dipping toward or below the 10 EMA supports a potential short or exit signal.
- Overbought/oversold discipline:
  - In a strong uptrend, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; avoid over-reliance on overbought readings alone. Use RSI in combination with trend and MACD to time pullbacks.
  - In choppier phases, a drop in RSI from overbought territory toward mid-range can precede a consolidation or a fresh leg higher if other momentum/trend signals align.
- Volatility-aware risk management:
  - Use ATR to set stop distances that reflect current volatility (e.g., a multiple of ATR below/above entry price). When ATR rises, widen stops slightly to avoid premature exits; when ATR compresses, tighten stops to protect profits.

What to expect in decision-making (AMD-specific considerations)
- AMD often reacts strongly to quarterly guidance, AI data-center demand, and supply chain dynamics. Expect rapid shifts in momentum around earnings or product-cycle news. Rely on a multi-indicator confirmation rather than a single signal to reduce whipsaws.
- In bullish accelerations, you may observe price above 50 and 200 SMAs with MACD positive and RSI trending higher but not excessively overbought; ATR may show rising volatility as the move runs.
- In pullbacks or reactions to news, price may test the 50 SMA or 10 EMA while MACD temporarily weakens; use ATR to gauge if pullbacks are deep or shallow and adjust stop levels accordingly.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now and then provide a data-driven, AMD-specific trend and signal table with the exact latest values for the 8 indicators above, plus a trading-ready interpretation.
- If you’d like me to proceed immediately with a retry, say “Retry data fetch for AMD,” and I’ll attempt again and then deliver a detailed, datapoints-backed report.

Appendix: quick reference table (indicator purpose and trade utility)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance; lagging signal, best used with faster indicators for entry timing.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; confirms broad market regime; slow to react; useful for strategic bias.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum shifts; potential early entry points; sensitive to noise; use with longer-term filters.
- macd: Momentum and trend change signals via EMA differentials; crossovers indicate potential shifts; best with corroboration.
- macds: MACD signal line; smoother crossover signals to time entries/exits; reduces false positives when used with other filters.
- macdh: Momentum strength gauge via histogram; divergence hints; helps with timing in volatile markets.
- rsi: Momentum strength/overbought-oversold cues; divergence signals possible reversals; interpret within trend context.
- atr: Volatility gauge; informs position sizing and stop placement; reactive measure; helps with risk management rather than direction.

- How it helps AMD trading
- Primary caveats

| Indicator | What it measures | How it helps AMD trading | Primary caveats |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average (mid-term trend) | Identifies trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; good for biasing trades toward the prevailing trend | Lagging; may give late signals in fast moves; need confirmations |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average (long-term trend) | Confirms overall market regime; useful for strategic trend confirmation (golden/death cross) | Slow to react; not ideal for precise entries |
| close_10_ema | 10-day exponential moving average (short-term momentum) | Captures quick momentum shifts; potential early entry points | Prone to noise; use with longer-term filters |
| macd | MACD line (EMA differences) | Primary momentum/trend-change signal; crossovers indicate potential shifts | Can false signal in sideways markets; best with confirmations |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Smoother crossovers; helps time entries/exits with reduced noise | Requires other signals to avoid false positives |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Visualizes momentum strength and divergence risk early | Can be volatile; use with additional filters in fast markets |
| rsi | Relative Strength Index | Identifies overbought/oversold conditions and momentum shifts | In strong trends, can stay extreme; use with trend analysis |
| atr | Average True Range | Gauges volatility to set stops and size positions appropriately | Reactive measure; use alongside other risk controls |

If you want me to retry the data fetch right away, just say “Retry data fetch for AMD,” and I’ll run it and then deliver a data-backed, updated AMD report with the 8 indicators above.
