I attempted to fetch the data for QQQ, but all tool calls failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the environment. Specifically:

- get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment
- get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions
- get_simfin_balance_sheet
- get_simfin_cashflow
- get_simfin_income_stmt

What this means: I can’t retrieve insider sentiment/transactions or any SimFin financial statements for QQQ right now. I can retry the data pull, but given the error, there’s a chance the tool layer is temporarily down.

Options to move forward

1) Retry now
- I can attempt to fetch the data again (either in parallel or sequentially) as soon as you confirm. If the environment is temporarily blocked, a retry may succeed shortly.

2) Shift to ETF-focused analysis (recommended for QQQ)
- QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index. Insider sentiment/transactions and typical “company-level” financials don’t apply cleanly to an ETF. A comprehensive ETF-focused fundamental report would cover:
  - Fund profile: objective, inception date, expense ratio, AUM, liquidity (average daily volume), distribution yield.
  - Holdings overview: top holdings, sector/industry weights, concentration risk, turnover/refresh rate.
  - Performance context: trailing returns (1D/1W/1M/3M/6M/1Y), tracking error vs. underlying index, volatility characteristics.
  - Structural factors: replication method (full replication vs. sampling), fee structure, tax considerations, creation/redemption mechanism.
  - Risk considerations: concentration risk in tech-heavy holdings, concentration vs. benchmark, potential liquidity implications.
- If you want this route, I’ll assemble a detailed ETF-focused report with a clear section-by-section narrative and a final summary of potential trading implications.

3) Keep using company-oriented tools with a different ticker
- If you’d like to work with a company instead of an ETF (for example, a Nasdaq-100 constituent such as Apple or Microsoft), I can proceed once the tool environment is functional.

What I need from you
- Do you want me to retry the data fetch for QQQ now, hoping the tools come back online?
- Or would you prefer I switch to an ETF-focused report on QQQ (without insider sentiment/transactions and company-level financials) and provide a thorough, trader-oriented analysis based on holdings, exposure, and fund metrics?

If you approve, I’ll proceed with the chosen path and deliver a comprehensive report, including a Markdown table at the end that consolidates key findings and actionable insights.
