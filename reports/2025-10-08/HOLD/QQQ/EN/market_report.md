Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the data and indicators for QQQ, but I’m hitting a data-access error right now which prevents me from producing the precise current values:

- The data retrieval service returned FileNotFoundError for YFin data and for the stockstats indicator reports.
- In short, I don’t have the actual numbers to compute and confirm the exact readings across the requested indicators at the moment.

What I can do now
- Outline the exact indicators I would pull (up to 8) and why they’re complementary for QQQ.
- Provide a detailed, nuanced framework for interpreting those indicators once data is available.
- If you’d like, I can retry immediately or after you authorize, or you can provide the CSV/data, and I’ll run the calculations and deliver a fully data-grounded report.

Recommended indicator set (non-redundant, complementary)
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend anchor. Helps confirm the dominant market regime (bullish vs bearish) and potential support/resistance zones.
- close_50_sma: Mid-term trend context. Useful for confirming trend direction and timing around the longer-term view.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum/shift signals. More responsive to recent moves; good for catching quicker entries when used with longer-term filters.
- macd: Momentum/trend strength via MACD line vs. zero line and its dynamics.
- macds: MACD Signal; crossovers with MACD provide clearer trigger signals within a broader trend context.
- macdh: MACD Histogram; visualizes momentum strength and helps spot divergences earlier than line-cross signals.
- rsi: Momentum gauge and overbought/oversold thresholds (commonly 70/30). Useful for spotting potential reversals in conjunction with trend context.
- atr: Volatility measure for risk management and position sizing; informs stop distances and how much price movement is typical in current regime.

Why this set is suitable for QQQ
- It covers trend (200SMA, 50SMA), timing (10 EMA), momentum (MACD trio, RSI), and risk/volatility (ATR) in a balanced way.
- It avoids redundancy by combining trend overlays (200/50SMA) with momentum and volatility rather than relying solely on a single family (e.g., RSI alone or MACD alone).
- It’s robust for a highly-traded tech-heavy ETF like QQQ, where regime shifts can be driven by macro risk appetite, tech earnings, and sector rotation.

How I’ll interpret these indicators once data is available
- Trend confirmation
  - Price is above both 200SMA and 50SMA, and the 50SMA is rising relative to the 200SMA -> bullish longer-term regime and potential pullback-friendly dynamic support.
  - If 50SMA crosses above 200SMA (golden cross) and price holds above both, this strengthens a constructive bias; if reversed (death cross), bias shifts bearish unless supported by other signals.
- Momentum and entry timing
  - MACD line above zero and above MACD Signal, with MACD Histogram (macdh) turning positive and rising -> upside momentum confirmed; look for pullbacks to the 50SMA/10EMA as potential entries if RSI supports it.
  - If MACD crosses below its signal or MACD becomes negative while price remains above long-term supports, expect potential consolidation or a trend pause.
  - RSI in a neutral-to-bullish range (e.g., 40–70) supports continued upside; RSI approaching overbought (70+) warrants watching for risk of a pullback, especially if MACD shows weakening momentum.
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising indicates increasing volatility; may justify wider stops and position sizing adjustments; ATR falling suggests a calmer market and tighter risk controls may be appropriate.
  - If price trades near Bollinger upper band (boll_ub) with momentum still positive, beware of a squeeze or a potential mean-reversion pullback; confirm with MACD and RSI.
  - If price touches Bollinger lower band (boll_lb) with MACD/momentum diverging, it could signal a potential mean-reversion or a buying opportunity in a dip, particularly if RSI shows room to rally.
- Reversal/divergence considerations
  - RSI diverging from price highs (higher highs in price, lower highs in RSI) can precede a pullback; wait for MACD/price to align before acting.
  - MACD histogram divergence (macdh) can warn of fading momentum even if price is still rising; use with ATR to gauge risk.

Practical decision framework (scenarios)
- Bullish continuation scenario
  - Price above 200SMA and rising; 50SMA above 200SMA; MACD positive and rising; MACDS above MACD and rising; RSI 40–70 trending up; ATR moderate; price near or above boll_ub in a strong uptrend.
  - Potential action: look for pullbacks to 50SMA or 10EMA as potential entries with stops below recent swing lows, or use a breakout approach if price breaks above a recent consolidation with MACD corroboration.
- Momentum exhaustion / pullback scenario
  - MACD shows weakening (declining histogram, MACD line flattening) while RSI remains elevated; price tests near resistance (previous highs) and struggles to push higher; ATR remains elevated but not expanding.
  - Potential action: reduce exposure or prepare for a controlled exit; wait for a fresh MACD positive crossover or a robust RSI reset before re-entering.
- Volatility-driven risk management scenario
  - ATR rising sharply with price moving erratically; MACD signals mixed; RSI fluctuating near overbought without clear momentum.
  - Potential action: tighten stops, reduce position size, or avoid new entries until volatility stabilizes; consider hedging if risk tolerance allows.

Caveats
- Markets and QQQ-specific factors (tech earnings, macro policy, rate expectations) can override purely technical signals.
- In highly volatile periods, MACD/RSI signals may produce false positives; rely on confluence with price above/below long-term moving averages and ATR-driven risk controls.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data and compute the eight indicators exactly, then provide a precise, data-backed report with a summary table and a signal checklist.
- If you’d prefer, you can share the data CSV or authorize a retry, and I’ll deliver a filled-out, trader-ready analysis.
