Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch TSLA data for the period 2024-10-08 to 2025-10-08, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t pull the live values right now. If you’d like, I can retry, or you can provide a data source or a snapshot. In the meantime, here’s a concise, non-data-dependent plan using a carefully selected set of indicators that offer complementary insights for TSLA’s typical price action and volatility.

Indicator set (up to 8, chosen for complementarity and coverage)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for TSLA
- Moving Averages (50SMA, 200SMA, 10EMA)
  - 50SMA: Captures medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helpful to filter trades in the context of TSLA’s frequent momentum shifts.
  - 200SMA: Provides a long-term trend benchmark. Useful to assess strategic context (golden/death cross considerations) and to align with larger macro moves in the stock.
  - 10EMA: A responsive short-term momentum gauge to flag quicker shifts, which is valuable given TSLA’s asymmetric news-driven moves and volatility.
- MACD Family (MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram)
  - MACD: Measures momentum via EMA differences; crossovers can indicate trend changes and potential entries/exits.
  - MACD Signal: The smoothed MACD line helps confirm MACD-derived signals, reducing false positives in choppy markets.
  - MACD Histogram: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence dynamics; useful for early notion of slowing or accelerating moves.
- RSI
  - RSI: Classic momentum and overbought/oversold gauge. Helpful for spotting potential reversals or pullbacks, especially when TSLA is extending in one direction.
- ATR
  - ATR: Measures volatility, informing risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and helping interpret signals in the context of changing volatility regimes typical to TSLA.

How these indicators can be interpreted together (framework you can apply as a template)
- Trend confirmation
  - If price trades above both 50SMA and 200SMA, and the 10EMA is above price or crossing upwards, you’re seeing a robust short-term move within a longer uptrend. Look for MACD bullish cross (MACD line crossing above MACD Signal) to strengthen the case; MACD Histogram turning positive supports momentum.
  - Conversely, price below 50SMA and 200SMA with 10EMA trending downward suggests a downturn bias; look for MACD bearish cross and MACD Histogram turning negative to confirm momentum shift.
- Momentum and timing
  - When MACD crosses above zero and the MACD line crosses above MACD Signal while RSI is not in overbought territory (e.g., RSI around 40–60 for a potential continuation), you may have favorable entries in a confirmed uptrend.
  - If RSI approaches or exceeds 70 while price remains above key moving averages, note potential overbought conditions; prefer alignment with MACD momentum and consider tighter ATR-based risk controls.
- Momentum strength vs. volatility
  - A rising MACD Histogram in tandem with a rising ATR indicates strengthening momentum with increasing volatility—this can present both opportunities and higher risk, warranting flexible stop placements.
  - If MACD momentum cools (Histogram shrinking toward zero or negative) while ATR rises (volatility spikes), be cautious of possible pullbacks or breakouts losing steam.
- Risk management
  - Use ATR to size stops: higher ATR suggests wider stops; lower ATR suggests tighter stops. Ensure stop levels are compatible with your risk per trade and the current volatility regime TSLA is in.
  - In periods of high volatility (high ATR) but constructive trend signals (positive MACD, price above key SMAs), you might allow for wider price swings but keep position sizes conservative relative to history.

Notes and caveats
- TSLA is known for news-driven moves and rapid volatility changes. The combination of 50SMA/200SMA and 10EMA helps blend trend fidelity with responsiveness.
- Rely on MACD crossovers for momentum confirmation but avoid acting on signals in isolation—cross-check with RSI and price-position relative to SMAs.
- Always consider risk controls with ATR-based sizing, and adjust for earnings events or major product/news catalysts that can abruptly alter volatility.

Proposed next steps (once data access is restored)
- Retrieve TSLA price data for the desired window.
- Compute the eight indicators exactly as listed.
- Generate a live, granular trend/momentum/volatility readout with current values, crossovers, and inferred trade signals.
- Deliver a concise signal table (Long/Neutral/Short with confidence level) plus risk guidelines.

Markdown table: key points at a glance
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - Type: Moving Average
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance
  - How to interpret: Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend bias; price below suggests downtrend bias
  - Trade signal cues: Price crossing above/below 50SMA; use with MACD confirmation
  - Notes: Lags price; use with faster indicators for timing
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - Type: Moving Average
  - What it measures: Long-term trend
  - How to interpret: Price above 200SMA = bullish longer-term context; below = bearish
  - Trade signal cues: Golden cross with 50SMA; death cross if 50SMA crosses below 200SMA
  - Notes: Strong trend filter; slower to react
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - Type: Moving Average
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum
  - How to interpret: 10EMA above price or crossing upwards indicates bullish tilt
  - Trade signal cues: 10EMA cross above/below short-term price bands
  - Notes: Prone to noise; combine with longer SMAs
- Indicator: macd
  - Type: MACD
  - What it measures: Momentum via EMA differences
  - How to interpret: MACD line crossing above zero or MACD Signal is bullish
  - Trade signal cues: MACD bullish cross with price above SMAs adds confirmation
  - Notes: Best used with other filters to avoid false positives
- Indicator: macds
  - Type: MACD Signal
  - What it measures: Smoothed MACD momentum
  - How to interpret: MACD Signal crossing with MACD can confirm signals
  - Trade signal cues: Bullish/bearish cross signals for entries/exits
  - Notes: Reduces noise from MACD
- Indicator: macdh
  - Type: MACD Histogram
  - What it measures: Momentum strength
  - How to interpret: Increasing positive histogram = strengthening up move; negative slope = weakening momentum
  - Trade signal cues: Histogram inflection aligns with MACD cross for stronger conviction
  - Notes: Can be volatile; use with additional filters
- Indicator: rsi
  - Type: RSI
  - What it measures: Momentum; overbought/oversold
  - How to interpret: RSI > 70 may warn of overbought; RSI < 30 may indicate oversold
  - Trade signal cues: Divergence with price or RSI zone breaches with MACD trend
  - Notes: In strong trends RSI can stay extended; rely on trend context
- Indicator: atr
  - Type: ATR
  - What it measures: Volatility
  - How to interpret: Rising ATR signals higher risk and wider stop needs
  - Trade signal cues: Use to scale stops and position sizes; confirm with price action
  - Notes: Reactive measure; complements trend/momentum, not a directional signal

If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now or after you specify a preferred data source. Otherwise, I can proceed with generating a live, data-backed report as soon as the system can access TSLA data.
