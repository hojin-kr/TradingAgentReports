Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull TSLA’s latest fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) for 2025-10-08, but all tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError indicating the data sources aren’t accessible in this session right now.

What I can do right now
- Retry data retrieval: I can attempt to fetch all five data sources again immediately if you’d like.
- Proceed with a rigorous framework: If you prefer, I can deliver a comprehensive, trader-focused fundamental report framework that you can fill in once data access is restored. This would include a detailed methodology, key data points to capture, and how to interpret them for TSLA.
- Use a best-effort qualitative analysis (no new numbers): I can provide detailed guidance on what to watch for in each area (insider sentiment, insider transactions, income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) based on general best practices and TSLA-specific risk/driver signals, clearly flagging what would need actual figures.

Proposed plan if you want the full, data-backed report once access is restored
- Company profile: business model, segments (vehicles, energy storage, solar), geographic exposure, strategic initiatives (pricing, capex cadence, model lineup) and recent catalysts.
- Financial documents (recent period, quarterly where available):
  - Income statement: revenues, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, YoY/QoQ trends, notable line items (cost of goods sold, R&D, SG&A, impairment).
  - Balance sheet: liquidity, cash & equivalents, debt levels, working capital, capitalized costs, intangible assets, equity structure.
  - Cash flow: operating cash flow, investing cash flow, financing cash flow, free cash flow, working capital changes.
- Financial history: trend analysis across the most recent 4–8 quarters/years, margin evolution, capital expenditure cadence, debt maturities, share count and dilution risks.
- Insider sentiment: qualitative read on insider confidence, ownership concentration, and any reported themes from recent filings.
- Insider transactions: notable purchases/sales, timing relative to earnings, potential implications for management incentives and capital allocation.
- Key risk factors: supply chain, demand variability, regulatory shifts, competition, macro headwinds.
- Trader-focused insights: what the data implies for momentum, valuation, and risk-reward in TSLA’s stock over the next 6–12 weeks.
- A compact Markdown table at the end summarizing key takeaways, data points, and interpretations.

Proposed Markdown table structure (for the final report)
- Section | Key Data Point | Latest Observation (with date) | Source | Trader Implication
- Examples:
  - Insider Sentiment | Positive/Neutral/Negative tone | [date range] | Finnhub | Potential short-term bias
  - Insider Transactions | Large buy/sell events | [date] | Finnhub | Allocation signal vs. earnings/news
  - Income Statement | Revenue growth, margin | [quarter] | SimFin | Profitability trend
  - Balance Sheet | Cash position, debt level | [quarter] | SimFin | Liquidity/risk assessment
  - Cash Flow | Operating cash flow trend | [quarter] | SimFin | Cash conversion efficiency
  - Overall Interpretation | Synthesis of signals | — | — | Tactical stance (Buy/Hold/Sell)

Next step options
1) I retry data retrieval now. If you want me to proceed with that, say “Retry now.”
2) You approve proceeding with the framework and checklist (no numbers yet). I’ll publish the full report skeleton and the final Markdown table structure you can populate once data is available.
3) If you have alternative data sources or a preferred date window, share them and I’ll tailor the plan accordingly.

Would you like me to retry the data pulls now, or would you prefer I deliver the detailed framework and checklist in the meantime?
