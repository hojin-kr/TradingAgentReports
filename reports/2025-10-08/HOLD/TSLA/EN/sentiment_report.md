Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch TSLA social sentiment data for 2025-10-08 using the Reddit stock info tool, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source is temporarily unavailable on my end, so I can’t pull the latest Reddit/social sentiment feed right now.

What would you like me to do next?
- Retry automatically: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again in a moment and then generate the full report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Use a placeholder/template: I can give you a complete long-form analysis framework and a filled-out Markdown table structure that you can populate once the data source is back, plus guidance on how to interpret the signals.
- Proceed with a manual framework: I can outline the exact analysis approach, what data to collect, and how to translate sentiment and news into trader implications, even if I don’t have the live feed right this moment.

If you’d prefer to proceed now without live data, here is a ready-to-fill framework and a template for the final report. You can paste in the data once the tool works again and I’ll finalize the detailed analysis.

What I can deliver once data is available
- A comprehensive, nuanced sentiment analysis for TSLA over the past week, including day-by-day sentiment, dominant themes, and potential driving events.
- A synthesis of recent company news impacting sentiment and risk (production updates, demand signals, regulatory issues, partnerships, FSD/AI developments, etc.).
- Trader-focused implications: catalysts to watch, risk factors, and possible trade ideas (short-term swing, options skews, etc.).
- A clear, easy-to-scan Markdown table at the end summarizing key themes and signals.

Template for the final Markdown table (to be filled after data collection)
- Theme | Sentiment (avg, range) | Key Drivers | News/Narratives | Potential Trader Implications | Confidence
- FSD/AI developments | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Price/volume catalysts (pricing, supply chain) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Manufacturing/production updates | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- EV demand signals (US/EU/China) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Regulatory or policy moves | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Key influencers/topics (top 5 themes) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...

If you want, I can try the Reddit data pull again right away. Just say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt the fetch again and then deliver the full long report with the Markdown table appended.
