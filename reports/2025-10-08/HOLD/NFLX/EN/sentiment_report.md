Thanks for the nudge. I ran into a tool error trying to fetch Reddit sentiment data for NFLX (FileNotFoundError). Specifically, attempts to pull Reddit stock news for 2025-10-02 through 2025-10-08 failed, and a direct fetch for 2025-10-08 also errored.

What I can do next (two options), please choose:
1) Retry Reddit data fetch now
- I can retry the Reddit feed for NFLX for the requested date range and pull the latest posts, upvotes, and sentiment signals as soon as the tool is available.

2) Proceed with an alternative sentiment/news-only analysis
- I can build a comprehensive report using other sources (public sentiment from X/Twitter, StockTwits, major news articles, company announcements, and earnings/official notes) once you confirm you’d like to broaden beyond Reddit. I will note that I don’t currently have a dedicated sentiment tool other than the Reddit tool in this session, but I can synthesize from public articles and social posts if you’re okay with that approach.

Proposed structure for the NFLX long-form report (to be filled with data as soon as Reddit data is available or with alternative sources if you choose option 2):
- Executive snapshot (current sentiment bias, key talking points, potential price/volatility implications)
- Daily sentiment arc (NFLX sentiment by date 2025-10-02 to 2025-10-08, or summarized weekly sentiment with day-by-day notes)
- Core talking points in social chatter
  - Content slate and competitive positioning (Netflix originals, licensing, franchise fatigue)
  - Pricing and tier strategy (ad-supported tier, password sharing, crackdowns)
  - Subscriber trends (net adds, churn risk, international growth)
  - Regulatory and macro concerns (advertising sensitivity, ad rates, streaming economics)
- News flow and catalysts (recent earnings commentary, key press releases, partnerships, product updates)
- Sentiment vs. fundamentals (how the mood aligns or diverges from fundamentals like ARPU, subscriber trajectory, content spend)
- Risk and opportunity tearsheet for traders
  - Potential catalysts (new content milestones, price tier changes, platform partnerships)
  - Risks (subscriber slowdown, competition, ad market volatility)
  - Trading implications (volatility expectations, sentiment-driven gaps)
- Quantified takeaways and scenarios
  - Bull case, base case, bear case with sentiment/price-inference overlays
- Appendix
  - Data sources and methodology (Reddit (if available), other social feeds, news, earnings data)
  - Quick reference glossary

Makrdown table (sample structure to append at the end):
- Topic | Sentiment Signal | Source | Potential Trading Implication | Confidence
- Subscriber Trends | Neutral to slightly positive | Reddit / News (or alternative sources) | Watch for a sustained subscriber uptick; if momentum stalls, risk-off sentiment may rise | Medium
- Content Slate/Originals | Mixed to positive | Reddit / News | Strong content slate could push upside; weak slate could cap upside | Medium
- Pricing / Ad-supported tier | Cautious optimism | Reddit / News | Advertiser demand and ARPU effects could drive volatility | Low
- Platform/Tech/Product | Positive on features; concerns on rollout | Reddit / News | Feature launches can drive intraday moves; bugs can spark quick reversals | Medium
- Macro/Advertising Market | Mixed | News | Ad market strength could reinforce upside; softness could weigh on sentiment | Low

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data pull now, or
- Proceed with option 2 (alternative sentiment/news synthesis) and begin assembling the report with non-Reddit sources?

If you prefer option 2, I’ll start collating and structuring the analysis right away and deliver the full long-form report plus the final Makrmarkdown table.
