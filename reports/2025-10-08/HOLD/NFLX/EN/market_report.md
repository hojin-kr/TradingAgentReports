Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch NFLX data and run the indicator suite, but the data fetch environment returned errors (FileNotFoundError) for all data pulls. I can proceed in two ways:
- Retry data retrieval now and, once successful, deliver a data-backed, fully calculated indicator review.
- Or provide a robust, nuanced framework of the most relevant indicators and how to interpret them for NFLX in today’s context, so you can apply them as soon as data is available.

Since the data fetch is currently blocked, I’ll present a detailed, nuanced framework with a carefully selected set of indicators (up to 8) that offer diverse, complementary insights for NFLX. I’ll also include a concise, structured table at the end to summarize how to read each signal.

Selected indicators (8 total) and rationale
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend via the 50-day simple moving average.
  - How to read: Price above 50 SMA suggests a positive medium-term trend; price below 50 SMA suggests a pullback or downtrend.
  - NFLX-use case: Use 50 SMA as a dynamic support/resistance level and to confirm trend direction when combined with other signals.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Long-term trend via the 200-day simple moving average.
  - How to read: Price above 200 SMA signals bullish long-term bias; price below signals bearish bias. Crosses (golden/death cross with shorter averages) can mark major regime shifts.
  - NFLX-use case: Acts as a strategic filter for entries/exits; favors long-side bias when price and near-term momentum align above 200 SMA.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum via the 10-day exponential moving average.
  - How to read: Price above 10 EMA indicates near-term bullish momentum; a cross below can indicate a shift to bearish momentum.
  - NFLX-use case: Captures quick shifts in momentum; good for timing entries when used with longer-term trend filters (50/200 SMA).

- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Momentum via difference between two EMAs (traditionally 12/26) reflected as MACD line vs. signal.
  - How to read: MACD line crossing above the signal line is typically bullish; crossing below is typically bearish. A rising MACD histogram confirms strengthening momentum.
  - NFLX-use case: Helps confirm breakouts or reversals beyond price action; useful in conjunction with trend lines and vol signals.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: Momentum strength via the gap between MACD line and its signal.
  - How to read: Positive histogram bars expanding suggest increasing bullish momentum; negative bars expanding suggest increasing bearish momentum.
  - NFLX-use case: Provides a visual gauge of momentum strength and potential divergences with price.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: Momentum magnitude and overbought/oversold conditions (relative strength index).
  - How to read: RSI above 70 can indicate overbought conditions (possible pullback); RSI below 30 can indicate oversold conditions (possible bounce). Divergences with price can signal reversals.
  - NFLX-use case: Helps identify potential reversal zones in the context of the prevailing trend; best used with trend and momentum filters to avoid trap trades in strong trends.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it measures: Average True Range, a volatility gauge.
  - How to read: Rising ATR indicates increasing volatility; falling ATR indicates a quiet market.
  - NFLX-use case: Useful for sizing and stop-placement; helps adapt risk to current market turbulence around events (e.g., earnings).

- vwma (VWMA)
  - What it measures: Volume-weighted moving average; price action filtered by volume.
  - How to read: Price moves that are confirmed by higher volume (VWMA alignment) tend to be more robust than price moves on low volume.
  - NFLX-use case: Adds a volume-confirmation layer to trend signals; helps avoid false breakouts in low-volume periods.

What this combination gives you
- Trend confirmation: 50 SMA and 200 SMA together help you assess whether NFLX is in a bullish or bearish regime.
- Momentum timing: 10 EMA with MACD and MACD Histogram offers both quick momentum cues (short-term) and more robust momentum shifts (MACD).
- Momentum quality: RSI adds a momentum perspective to identify potential reversal risk in overbought/oversold zones, especially when the trend is strong.
- Volatility management: ATR informs risk controls (stops, position sizing) in relation to current volatility, while VWMA adds volume context to price moves for more reliable entries.
- Trade filtering: This suite provides a balanced mix of trend, momentum, volatility, and volume signals to reduce false positives and improve edge.

Nuanced interpretation framework (without current data)
- In a bullish regime (price above 200 SMA, 50 SMA rising, price above 50 SMA):
  - Look for price above 50 SMA and a bullish MACD cross with rising histogram.
  - Confirm momentum with RSI not in overbought extreme; prefer pullbacks to 10 EMA or 50 SMA for entries.
  - Use VWMA to confirm that rallies are supported by above-average volume; scale positions with ATR-based volatility.
- In a choppy/range-bound regime (price oscillating around 50 SMA, 200 SMA flat):
  - Rely more on MACD histogram and RSI to identify potential divergences; be cautious with breakouts when ATR is elevated.
  - Avoid large positions unless VWMA confirms a volume-supported breakout and price moves beyond a major MA resistance.
- Around earnings or clear catalysts (NFLX is known for volatile events):
  - Expect ATR spikes; use ATR for stop placement and position sizing; prefer signals that align across multiple indicators (e.g., MACD momentum, RSI support, and VWMA confirmation) before entering.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry fetching NFLX data now and deliver a data-backed, point-in-time indicator report (values, crossovers, momentum readings, etc.).
- Alternatively, I can generate a more generic set of actionable rules and example entry/exit criteria based on these indicators, to be applied once data is available.

Appendix: quick reference table
Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to read signals | Practical use for NFLX
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend (50-day) | Price above 50 SMA = uptrend; cross below = potential pullback | Dynamic support/resistance; trend alignment checks
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend (200-day) | Price above 200 SMA = bullish bias; below = bearish | Strategic trend filter; prefer long entries when aligned with other signals
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price above 10 EMA = bullish momentum; cross below = bearish | Timing entries; complements longer-term trend
- macd | MACD | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD line crosses signal = signal; histogram rising = momentum strengthening | Confirm breakouts/reversals with price action
- macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Positive/expanding histogram = bullish momentum; negative/contracting = bearish | Gauge momentum intensity and divergences
- rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold and momentum | RSI > 70 = overbought; RSI < 30 = oversold; watch for divergences | Reversal risk signals within trend context
- atr | Volatility | Market volatility | Rising ATR = higher volatility; falling ATR = compression | Risk management: stop placement and position sizing
- vwma | Volume-Based | Price action weighted by volume | Price movement confirmed by higher volume = stronger signal | Volume-confirmed entries; reduces false breakouts

Status note
- Data fetch currently failed due to environment/file-not-found errors. I’m ready to retry now or on your command. Once data is available, I’ll deliver a fully data-driven, point-in-time report including actual values, indicator readings, crossovers, and a trade-oriented interpretation for NFLX.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now and produce the complete, data-backed NFLX indicator report?
