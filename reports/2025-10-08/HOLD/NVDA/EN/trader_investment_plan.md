No past memories found. Based on the provided investment plan and current market context, my next trading decision is to Buy NVDA with a disciplined, staged-entry approach and robust risk controls.

Recommendation
- Buy NVDA, using a staged entry and explicit risk management to capture the long-term AI infrastructure tailwinds while limiting downside.

Actionable execution plan
- Initial allocation: Start with a modest tranche representing 2–3% of risk capital to establish exposure.
- Add-on entries: If NVDA holds above key support or a constructive pullback (for example, a confirmed bounce near a defined level or a move above a near-term resistance-turned-support), consider a second tranche of 1–2%.
- Stops and risk controls:
  - Use an ATR-based stop: initial stop around 1.5x ATR below entry for the first tranche.
  - For added tranches, trail stops with approximately 1.25–1.5x ATR as the position proves itself.
  - Cap single-name risk: ensure NVDA exposure never dominates risk capital and keep a hard cap on position size relative to your overall risk budget.
- Hedging: employ a protective put or a collar on a portion of the position to limit downside while preserving upside potential, scaled to risk tolerance. Optional use of broader hedges if you hold large semis exposure.
- Catalysts and timing: focus on earnings, AI partnerships, and infra capex guidance as key signals. Reassess on earnings when guidance or trajectory shifts meaningfully.
- Monitoring framework:
  - Trend signals: monitor 50-day vs 200-day moving averages, price strength relative to those levels.
  - Momentum and volatility: track MACD, RSI, and ATR to adjust stops and exposure.
  - Watch for bear-case triggers: changes in hyperscale capex commentary, regulatory/export-control news, or meaningful competitive milestones; tighten risk controls if these emerge.
- Scenario planning:
  - Base case: sustained AI compute demand supports a gradual rise; maintain exposure with a disciplined trailing risk regime.
  - Bull case: faster AI adoption or stronger software monetization; allow for some upside nibbling within risk limits.
  - Bear case: macro/regulatory headwinds or cycle slowdown; tighten risk controls and be prepared to trim or exit if downside signals overwhelm upside thesis.

Rationale aligned with the plan
- Structural tailwinds from AI compute demand underpin NVDA’s multi-layer moat (hardware leadership, CUDA ecosystem, software-driven monetization) and a growing TAM across hyperscalers, enterprises, and edge deployments.
- While valuation is rich and bear-case risks are real, a staged-entry with risk controls preserves upside while limiting downside in adverse scenarios.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
