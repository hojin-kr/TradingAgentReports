Thanks for the prompt. I’m running into a tool issue: the get_reddit_stock_info function is returning a FileNotFoundError right now, so I can’t fetch the NVDA-related Reddit data for 2025-10-08 at the moment. I can’t complete the live Reddit sentiment extraction until that tool is working again. If you’d like, I can proceed in one of the following ways:

Options
- Retry now: I’ll attempt to fetch Reddit data again as soon as the tool is responsive.
- Proceed with a skeleton report: I’ll deliver a detailed analysis framework, methodology, and a filled-out template with placeholders where Reddit sentiment data would go. Once the tool is back, we can plug in the actual figures and update the narrative.
- Use alternative sources: We can compile a qualitative analysis based on press releases, earnings notes, and public sentiment data from other channels (if available in your workflow) and clearly label where Reddit data would be incorporated.

What I can deliver right now (without live Reddit data)
- A comprehensive research framework you can reuse weekly
- Methodology for parsing social sentiment, including day-by-day tracking, key narratives, and risk factors
- An actionable trading implications section with potential ideas (HOLD, BUY, SELL) and risk controls
- A Markdown-ready summary with a polished table of key points (placeholders where Reddit data will go)

Proposed report structure (NVDA, past week)
- Executive snapshot
  - High-level sentiment direction (positive/neutral/negative) and catalysts
  - Notable price action and volume context over the week
- Social sentiment methodology
  - Sources: Reddit (primary), plus other channels if available
  - Metrics: sentiment score, volume, new vs. existing discussions, major narratives
  - Day-by-day breakdown and volatility considerations
- Thematic narratives in the past week
  - AI demand and data center commentary
  - GPU supply/demand dynamics and product cycle (Hopper/Lovelace/4nm generation updates, if relevant)
  - Gaming and consumer sentiment
  - China/regulatory/regulatory scrutiny and supply chain commentary
  - Competitor chatter and market share discourse
- News catalysts and impact
  - Any earnings signals, product announcements, supply chain updates, partnerships, or regulatory moves
  - How these align with or diverge from social sentiment
- Price action context
  - Key support/resistance zones observed in the week
  - Correlation between sentiment shifts and price/volume moves
- Risk considerations
  - Sentiment-driven risk (e.g., sudden Reddit-driven narratives)
  - Longer-term macro and AI market risk factors
- Trading implications and ideas
  - Short-term swing trades vs. longer-term positioning
  - Risk controls (stop levels, position sizing, event-driven risk windows)
  - Scenarios: bullish sentiment shift, bearish sentiment shift, neutral drift
- Data visualization ideas (to accompany the report)
  - Day-by-day sentiment line chart
  - Volume-adjusted sentiment heatmap
  - Narrative bar charts highlighting top themes
- Appendix
  - Data sources and caveats
  - Definitions of metrics used

Sample Markdown table (structure you can fill in later)
- The table below is a placeholder you can populate once Reddit data is available.

| Metric / Narrative | Week  of 2025-10-01 to 2025-10-08 | Notes / Implications |
|---|---|---|
| Reddit sentiment score (daily) | [to fill] | Primary driver for day-to-day swing potential |
| Reddit post volume (daily) | [to fill] | Signals interest/attention shifts |
| Top 3 narratives | [to fill] | AI demand, supply chain, product updates, regulatory concerns |
| Price action (close) | [to fill] | Compare with sentiment shifts |
| Volume spikes | [to fill] | Possible confirmation of narrative-driven moves |
| Key catalysts | [to fill] | Earnings, product news, partnerships, regulatory events |
| Trading implication | [to fill] | Bias and risk controls based on sentiment trend |

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry the Reddit data fetch now and then complete the full analysis with actual figures and narrative labels.
- Alternatively, I can deliver the skeleton report immediately and populate the Reddit-specific sections once the tool is available.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry now, I’ll attempt again as soon as the tool becomes accessible.
