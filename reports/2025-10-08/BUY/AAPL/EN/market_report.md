I attempted to fetch AAPL data and run the 8 indicators, but I’m hitting a data-access error in the current environment (FileNotFoundError) for the Yahoo/YFin data and for the stockstats indicators. I can retry immediately or you can approve a follow-up attempt later. In the meantime, here’s a rigorous plan: the eight indicators I’d use for complementary, non-redundant insight on AAPL, plus why they fit a typical equity-trading context around 2025-10-08. When the data retrieval succeeds, I’ll generate the actual values and provide a detailed, data-backed trend assessment.

Proposed eight indicators for AAPL (diverse, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- rsi
- boll
- atr
- vwma

Rationale and how they complement each other
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average): Provides the medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for gauging whether the price is in a clearer uptrend or downtrend relative to a common time horizon.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average): Establishes the long-term trend benchmark. When price is above the 200 SMA, the bias is typically bullish; below suggests bearish bias. Also helps filter out false signals in choppier environments.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average): A responsive short-term trend/momentum gauge. Helps identify quicker shifts in price action and potential entry points, but can be noisy in ranges; benefits from confirmation with longer-term averages.
- macd (MACD line): Momentum indicator based on EMAs. Crosses of MACD with the signal line and the zero line provide signals about momentum changes and potential trend shifts. Best used with other confirmations.
- rsi (Relative Strength Index): Momentum gauge indicating overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. In strong trends, RSI can stay elevated, so it should be interpreted alongside trend context.
- boll (Bollinger middle band, i.e., 20-SMA): Provides a volatility-adjusted baseline and a reference for breakouts/mean reversion relative to a dynamic middle line.
- atr (Average True Range): Measures volatility magnitude. Useful for dynamic risk management: setting stops, sizing, and adjusting expectations for continuations or reversals based on current volatility.
- vwma (Volume Weighted Moving Average): Confirms trend with volume. Price action aligned with high-volume VWMA tends to be more robust; divergences between price and VWMA can warn of weaker moves or false breakouts.

How I’ll interpret signals once data is available
- Trend alignment: Look for alignment across 50_sma, 200_sma, and 10_ema. A bullish setup would typically prefer price above both moving averages with 10_ema above 50_sma and 200_sma trending upward. A bearish setup would be the opposite, with price below these averages and potential cross-downs.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD should corroborate price-driven signals (MACD above zero and rising for bullish bias; below zero and falling for bearish bias). RSI should be in a non-extreme zone or showing a bullish/bearish divergence in context of the trend.
- Volatility context: Bollinger bands provide breakout/reversion context; widening bands suggest higher volatility and potentially larger moves, while tightening bands may precede a breakout. ATR confirms whether the current move has accompanying volatility levels suitable for the planned risk controls.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA helps verify that moves are supported by volume. Breakouts or trend changes accompanied by rising VWMA-consistent volume are generally more robust than moves with weak volume.

Next steps
- I’ll retry data retrieval as soon as possible (a fresh attempt to read Yahoo/YFin data and recompute the 8 indicators). If you’d like, I can also try an alternative data source or adjust the date range.
- If you’re in a hurry, I can proceed with a detailed, qualitative scenario analysis using the chosen indicator framework and provide decision guidance templates (entry/exit rules, risk management) that you can apply once data is available.

Key points to consider (for a trader using these eight indicators)
- Use 50_sma and 200_sma to define the macro trend; avoid counter-trend entries when they disagree with MACD/RSSI signals.
- Use 10_ema for timely entries but require MACD and RSI confirmation to avoid whipsaws.
- Use MACD to gauge momentum strength and potential crossovers; pair with RSI to filter false positives in range-bound markets.
- Use Boll to spot breakout or mean-reversion opportunities; confirm with ATR for volatility context and with VWMA for volume-backed moves.
- Use VWMA to validate that price moves have credible volume behind them.

Markdown table — quick reference of the indicators and their roles
| Indicator | What it measures | How signals help | How to use for decisions |
| - | - | - | - |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Crossover with price; relative position to price indicates trend slope | Use as baseline trend; seek confluence with MACD/RSSI before entries |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above = bullish bias; below = bearish bias; crossovers indicate longer-term shifts | Align entries with long-term trend; avoid counter-trend trades when conflicting signals exist |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below, or EMA slope, signals quick momentum shifts | Look for rapid moves confirmed by MACD and RSI before entry |
| macd | Momentum change; trend strength | Crosses with signal; direction relative to zero line | Confirm with price action and RSI; use for entries/exits with trend bias |
| rsi | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold | >70 overbought, <30 oversold; potential divergences | In uptrends, be wary of overbought readings; use divergences with trend context |
| boll | Volatility around a 20-SMA; breakout/mean-reversion context | Price near/against bands suggests sensitivity to volatility; band expansion signals larger moves | Use with MACD/RSSI for breakouts; expect larger swings when bands widen |
| atr | Volatility magnitude | Higher ATR means larger expected moves; informs risk management | Set stop-losses and position sizes proportionally to volatility |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend | Price movement aligned with high VWMA volume is more credible | Confirm breakouts with volume; be cautious of moves on low volume |

I’ll proceed to retry fetching the data and run the eight indicators as soon as the data source is accessible. If you want me to switch data sources or adjust the date window (e.g., last 12–18 months or a different anchoring date), tell me which you prefer.
