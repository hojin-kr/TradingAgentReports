Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit stock news for AAPL on 2025-10-08, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError repeatedly. I’ve retried a few times with the same result. I can proceed in one of two ways:

Options
1) Retry now and wait for the Reddit data tool to come back online, then deliver the full, data-filled long report (including the Markdown table). 
2) Proceed with a comprehensive sentiment/news analysis that does not rely on the Reddit data tool, clearly noting Reddit data is unavailable in this run. I’ll still cover social sentiment, recent company news, and implications for traders, and I’ll append the Markdown table at the end of the final report.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like, I can start with option 2 immediately and provide a structured, trader-focused analysis now, with a placeholder note where Reddit data would be.

What I’ll deliver in the final report (when data is available)
- Daily sentiment trend for the past week (if Reddit data is available) plus key themes driving sentiment
- Summary of recent Apple (AAPL) company news and how it’s being perceived
- Event-driven risk and opportunity assessment (products, services, supply chain, guidance expectations)
- Implications for traders/investors (short/medium-term posture: bias, volatility drivers, potential catalysts)
- Quantified sentiment signals (e.g., sentiment score ranges, notable sentiment shifts, top-positive/top-negative themes)
- Actionable takeaways and potential trading ideas (with caveats)

Markdown table (to be included in the final report)
- I will populate with: Date, Source, Sentiment Tilt, Key Themes, Notable News, Potential Implications, Recommended Stance

If you’d like me to proceed now with option 2 (non-Reddit-first analysis), I’ll start compiling a thorough report right away and clearly mark Reddit data as unavailable in this run.
