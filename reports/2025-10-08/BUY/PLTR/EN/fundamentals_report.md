I attempted to fetch the latest PLTR fundamentals (SimFin balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow, plus Finnhub insider sentiment & insider transactions) but all calls returned a FileNotFoundError indicating the data source or path is currently unavailable.

What happened
- Tools invoked: 
  - get_simfin_balance_sheet (quarterly, curr_date 2025-10-08)
  - get_simfin_income_stmt (quarterly, curr_date 2025-10-08)
  - get_simfin_cashflow (quarterly, curr_date 2025-10-08)
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment (curr_date 2025-10-08)
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions (curr_date 2025-10-08)
- Result: All calls returned FileNotFoundError: "No such file or directory". This looks like a temporary data access issue on the backend, not a user error.

Next steps (options)
1) Retry now or after a short wait
   - I can re-attempt all data fetches immediately, or you can specify a new curr_date (e.g., 2025-09-30) and I’ll try again.
2) Try alternative data sources or formats
   - If available, we can switch to annual data or a different data provider if the environment supports it.
3) Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals analysis
   - If you’d prefer, I can deliver a detailed, yet data-less, fundamentals-focused report on Palantir (PLTR) using publicly known factors (business model, revenue mix, profitability trajectory, balance sheet health, liquidity, capital structure, and qualitative insider sentiment/transactions dynamics). I will clearly mark where data is estimated or based on public context rather than the latest fetch.

If you’d like me to proceed now:
- Please confirm whether to retry the data fetch as-is (curr_date 2025-10-08, quarterly), or provide a new date.
- Or, tell me to switch to a qualitative analysis for PLTR now, and I’ll produce a thorough report with a Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, risks, and potential trader signals.

I can also try a partial approach: fetch what is likely to be available (e.g., a high-level income statement outline or general balance sheet cues) if any of the tools respond, and build a partial report while we resolve the data access issue.
