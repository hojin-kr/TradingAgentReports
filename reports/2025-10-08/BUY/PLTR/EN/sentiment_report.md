I ran into an internal tool error fetching Reddit news for PLTR on 2025-10-08: FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source behind the Reddit news fetch isn’t accessible right now.

What I can do next:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (I can attempt up to a few consecutive retries in this session).
- If you prefer, pause and try again later when the tool is available.
- Or we can proceed with a scaffolded long-form report using any other data sources you approve (news headlines you provide, or I can outline the full report structure and key analysis points and fill in data once the Reddit tool is working again).

If you want me to retry now, I’ll attempt to fetch the Reddit stock news for PLTR for 2025-10-08 and then produce the comprehensive, day-by-day sentiment and news analysis you asked for, concluding with a Markdown table of key points.

In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the final long report once the data is in:
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment trend on PLTR from Reddit and recent news catalysts.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: day-by-day sentiment scores and notable thread topics for the past week.
- Top themes: recurring concerns, bullish catalysts, and reputation signals (e.g., government contracts, AI/data strategy, earnings expectations, regulatory or geopolitical factors).
- Newsflow synthesis: key headlines from official channels, major outlets, and niche communities; what moved the stock (priceline events, product announcements, partnerships).
- Risk/uncertainty map: data integrity concerns, sentiment spikes vs. actual fundamentals, potential overreactions, and possible catalysts.
- Trader implications: how the sentiment and news environment could influence price action, volatility, and timing considerations.
- Quantified takeaways: concrete sentiment ranges, notable threshold triggers, and suggested watchlist criteria.
- Appendix: data sources, methodology, and any caveats.

If you’d like me to proceed with retries now, just say “Retry now.” If you have a preferred date window or want me to switch to a different data source (news headlines you provide or another feed), tell me and I’ll adjust.
