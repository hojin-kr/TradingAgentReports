Thanks for the update. I attempted to pull Reddit stock info for SPY on 2025-10-08, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I retried several times and it still isn’t pulling data. It looks like the Reddit data feed isn’t accessible in this session right now.

Here are two workable options moving forward:

Option A — Retry later
- I can keep trying to fetch the Reddit sentiment data for SPY on 2025-10-08 as soon as the data source is available again.
- If you want, I can also try a nearby date (e.g., 2025-10-07 or 2025-10-09) to get a sense of the week’s sentiment trail, then interpolate.

Option B — Proceed without Reddit data (tool-free, trader-focused analysis)
- I can deliver a comprehensive SPY analysis focused on sentiment drivers, macro news, and trading implications using available signals beyond Reddit (e.g., macro data, earnings, Fed commentary, market breadth, etc.). Note: this will not include Reddit-specific posts or scores for the specified date.
- Deliverable would be a long-form report with:
  - Executive snapshot
  - Macro/regulatory/news backdrop
  - Sentiment and technical framing (without the Reddit feed)
  - Key drivers and scenario analysis
  - Trading implications and risk factors
  - A concise wrap-up with actionable takeaways
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing key points

If you’d like, I can start with Option B right away and clearly label any data gaps due to the Reddit tool issue. Let me know which option you prefer, or share a preferred date range or alternative data source for sentiment.
