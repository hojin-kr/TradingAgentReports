Based on the comprehensive analysis provided, I agree with the recommendation to **Sell** PLTR due to its financial instability, market saturation, and challenges in the automotive industry outweighing its growth potential.

However, upon further review of the proposed investment plan and the lessons learned from previous trading decisions, I would like to revise my position slightly. While the risks associated with PLTR are significant, I believe that the company's focus on EV manufacturing and growing customer base is worth considering.

To mitigate the risks, I would recommend a **Buy** strategy with a stop-loss order in place to limit potential losses. This would allow me to benefit from any potential upside while minimizing my exposure to potential downsides.

The key factors that led me to this revised recommendation are:

1. PLTR's growing customer base and increasing revenue in the EV market.
2. The significant investment made by a leading venture capital firm, which demonstrates confidence in the company's prospects.
3. The need for a contrarian view, as the Bull Analyst's argument is strong, but not without merit.

**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY**
