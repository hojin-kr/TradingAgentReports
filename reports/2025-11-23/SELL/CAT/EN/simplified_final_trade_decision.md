# Investment Report: CAT
## Executive Summary

## Investment Decision
SELL Caterpillar Inc.'s (CAT) stock immediately.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
The company's growth potential and competitive advantages are not enough to outweigh the bearish concerns about the downturn in the construction industry, mixed sentiment on Reddit, and slowing US GDP growth rate.

- Slowing down of US GDP growth rate
- Impact of interest rate hikes on Caterpillar Inc.'s financial performance
