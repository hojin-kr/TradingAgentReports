Based on the news and trends gathered from EODHD, finnhub, and reddit, here is a comprehensive report on the current state of the world relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Global Markets:**
The global stock markets have experienced a mixed week, with some indices rising while others have fallen. The S&P 500 rose by 1.2% during the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite rose by 2.1%, driven by gains in tech stocks.

**Earnings Season:**
The earnings season has kicked off, with several major companies reporting their quarterly results. Many of these companies have exceeded expectations, which has led to a surge in stocks. However, some companies have also missed expectations, leading to a decline in their stock prices.

**Interest Rates:**
The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive month, citing concerns over inflation. However, there are signs that the Fed may be preparing to raise interest rates again, which could impact bond yields and stock markets.

**Economic Data:**
The US economy released its Q3 GDP growth rate, which came in at 2.1%, beating expectations of a 2% growth rate. This suggests that the economy is still growing, but at a slower pace than previously thought.

**Geopolitics:**
Tensions between the US and China have escalated, with both countries imposing new tariffs on each other's goods. This has led to concerns over trade wars and their impact on global markets.
