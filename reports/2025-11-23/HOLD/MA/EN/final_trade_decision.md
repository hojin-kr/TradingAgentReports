**Rationale:**

Based on the debate, I agree with the Risky Analyst that Meta Platforms, Inc. offers a compelling opportunity for growth and returns. While both Neutral and Safe Analysts present valid arguments about risk mitigation and diversification, I believe the benefits of investing in high-growth companies like Meta outweigh the potential drawbacks.

Counterargument:

* Neutral Analyst's point about prioritizing risk mitigation is well-taken, but I agree that a diversified portfolio should be evaluated in light of the overall market environment and industry trends.
* Safe Analyst's concerns about regulatory changes and market saturation are valid, but I believe a cautious approach can minimize potential losses while still capturing some of the potential benefits of investing in Meta Platforms, Inc.
