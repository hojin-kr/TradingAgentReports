**Finnhub News Analysis**

According to the Finnhub news feed, over the past week (Nov 16 - Nov 23), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) has seen significant price fluctuations. On November 16th, ORCL stock closed at $93.42, and by November 17th, it had risen to $96.11. However, on November 18th, the stock dropped back down to $92.58 due to a decline in the company's quarterly earnings report.

Despite this volatility, Finnhub news suggests that ORCL is still maintaining its momentum. The financials of Oracle Corporation showed positive aspects such as a revenue increase of 10% compared to the same period last year. This boost was mainly driven by growth in cloud services and infrastructure sales.

**Reddit News Analysis**

On Reddit's r/investing, users have been discussing ORCL stock with varying opinions on its future prospects. Some investors believe that the recent earnings report will mark a turning point for Oracle Corporation, as they predict an increase in demand for their cloud-based solutions.

Others, however, are more skeptical about the company's ability to maintain its growth rate and express concerns over increasing competition from other tech giants such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

**Google News Analysis**

A Google news search reveals that global economic uncertainty has led investors to become cautious. The COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, and recession fears have pushed the financial markets into a state of volatility.

Among the top stories related to Oracle Corporation are reports on its potential acquisition of TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. This deal would further solidify Oracle's position in the rapidly growing cloud services market.

**Current State of ORCL**

Based on these news sources, it appears that Oracle Corporation is still maintaining its growth momentum despite recent volatility. The company's quarterly earnings report highlighted positive revenue increases and a strong demand for its cloud-based solutions.

However, investors should remain cautious due to global economic uncertainty and the increasing competition in the tech industry. A closer look at ORCL's financials reveals an increase in revenue but also rising costs associated with expanding its cloud infrastructure.
