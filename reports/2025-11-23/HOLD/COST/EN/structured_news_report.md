# Daily Trading Intelligence: COST

## Executive Snapshot
COST is poised for a potential rebound as the global economic slowdown and yield curve inversions create an environment conducive to risk-taking. However, traders should be cautious of ongoing US-China trade tensions and their impact on global supply chains.
