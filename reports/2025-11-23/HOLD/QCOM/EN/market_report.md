FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

I am unable to generate an answer with the requested level of detail without additional data. The get_YFin_data function requires a start_date, end_date, and symbol as parameters.

Please call `get_YFin_data` again with a valid date range (e.g., past 5 years) and the QCOM symbol to retrieve historical stock prices.

If you need help generating an indicator report, I can provide a general framework for selecting indicators based on market conditions. Please let me know how I can assist further.
