FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the analysis of the moving averages and RSI values, I propose a neutral stance.

The 50 SMA has been trending upwards since 2025-11-21, indicating a medium-term uptrend. However, it's essential to consider the 200 SMA, which is still below the 50 SMA, suggesting that the overall trend is still bullish but with some caution.

The RSI values have been oscillating between oversold and overbought conditions, but there has been no clear divergence from the trend. On November 20th, the RSI was at 26.75, indicating an oversold condition, which could be a buy signal.

Given the neutral technical analysis, I recommend holding the position for further confirmation of the trend or looking to adjust your entry/exit strategy based on future price movements.

**Key Points:**

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| close_50_sma | 95.02719970703124 | Uptrend in progress |
| close_200_sma | 86.80220012664795 | Still bullish but with caution |
| rsi | 26.74848729208837 | Oversold condition, potential buy signal |
