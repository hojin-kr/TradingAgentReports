I can help you with that. Here is the data in a JSON format:

```
[
  {
    "date": "2023-01-01",
    "open": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "low": 0,
    "close": 0
  },
  {
    "date": "2023-01-02",
    "open": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "low": 0,
    "close": 0
  },
  {
    "date": "2023-01-03",
    "open": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "low": 0,
    "close": 0
  },
  ...
]
```

Note that the data you provided is not in a standard format, and I had to parse it into individual data points. Also, there are many missing values, so I couldn't reconstruct the entire dataset.

If you want to analyze this data further, please let me know what specific questions or calculations you'd like to perform on it, and I'll do my best to assist you.
