FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

As of the current market conditions, our team's analysis suggests that AVGO is in an uptrend. The 50 SMA (348.0891748046875) has been increasing steadily since its last reading on November 17th at 348.9164025878906.

The RSI (44.92127714562899) has dipped below the 50-level, indicating a slight oversold condition. However, considering the overall uptrend and recent price movements, we are leaning towards holding onto our current position. The recent price action suggests that AVGO is gaining momentum and may continue to rise.

Looking at the Bollinger Middle (355.90950164794924), which serves as the benchmark for price movement, it appears that the stock has been consolidating above this level. Given the overall uptrend and increasing price movements, our team recommends holding onto AVGO for now.

We do not recommend buying or selling AVGO at this time due to the lack of clear entry points. However, if you're looking to get in on the trend, we suggest keeping an eye on the stock's momentum and being prepared to make a move when the RSI reaches the overbought zone (above 70).
