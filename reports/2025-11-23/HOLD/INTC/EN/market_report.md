FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the indicator values provided, here's a detailed analysis of the current market trends:

**Current Market Trends Analysis**

The company INTC has been experiencing an upward trend in its stock price over the past few days, with some minor fluctuations. The close_10_ema value on November 21st is 35.515687260200274, indicating a slight decrease from the previous day's high of 36.21281700876922. However, this is still above the lower trend line of 34.4 (50% retracement of the last two peaks). 

The close_200_sma value on November 21st is 25.42914996147156, showing that the long-term trend for INTC is slightly bearish. The golden cross occurred in April 2025 when the closing price was higher than 50-SMA (35.49), and it has been trading above it since then.

The RSI value on November 21st is 58.22, indicating a slight overbought condition. However, considering the slow reaction of the close_200_sma to changes in market conditions, this may not be a strong enough signal for immediate entry or exit.

**Buy/Hold/Sell Recommendation:**

Based on the current trends and indicators, we cannot make any specific buy/sell/hold recommendations without further analysis. However, given the recent uptrend, it might be worth considering holding onto INTC stock until the close_200_sma value reaches a certain level (50-20% retracement of 200-sma).
