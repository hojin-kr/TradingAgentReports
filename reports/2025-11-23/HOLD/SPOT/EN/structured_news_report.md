## Executive Snapshot
The global market has been experiencing a mixed trend over the past week, with gains in the tech sector offset by losses in other sectors. The recent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve and rising inflation concerns have added to the uncertainty.

The global economy is facing a slowdown in economic growth, driven by declining consumer spending and investment. The yield curve remains inverted, which can be a sign of an impending recession. Rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions are also contributing to higher inflation, with October's inflation rate increasing to 2%.
