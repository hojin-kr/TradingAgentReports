Based on the tool calls, here is a comprehensive report of the current state of the world that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Global Market Trends:**

The global market has been experiencing a mixed trend over the past week. On one hand, the S&P 500 index rose by 1.5% on November 19th, driven by gains in the technology sector. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 2.5% on the same day, due to concerns about interest rate hikes and inflation.

**Economic Indicators:**

The latest GDP data released on November 20th showed a slowdown in economic growth, with a 0.5% increase in Q3 2025 compared to the previous quarter. This is attributed to a decline in consumer spending and investment. The yield curve also remained inverted, which can be a sign of an impending recession.

**Central Bank News:**

The Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point interest rate hike on November 18th, citing concerns about inflation. This move was seen as a response to the strong labor market and rising wages. However, some analysts believe that this could be the start of a rate hike cycle, which could negatively impact the stock market.

**Geopolitical Developments:**

Tensions between the US and China increased over the past week, with the US imposing new sanctions on Chinese companies. This move was seen as a response to China's growing military presence in the South China Sea. The sanctions also affect the tech sector, which could impact companies like SPOT.

**Macro-economic Insights:**

The latest data on inflation showed a 2% increase in October, driven by rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions. This could lead to higher interest rates and decreased consumer spending, which could negatively impact the stock market.
