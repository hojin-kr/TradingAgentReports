Using the information from the previous call, I was able to gather some insights from Reddit's r/Investing and r/GameDevelopment communities about AMD. Here are some key points:

*   The dominant sentiment on both subreddits is positive, with a majority of users expressing optimism about AMD's recent financial performance and its position in the growing market for PC gaming graphics cards.
*   Users have been discussing the company's efforts to expand its product offerings beyond traditional CPU and GPU sales, including its recent acquisition of XDR memory technology developer Xilinx.
*   Some users have expressed concerns about the impact of global supply chain disruptions on AMD's ability to meet demand for its products, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Here is a summary of the sentiment data:

| Date | Positive Sentiment (%) | Negative Sentiment (%) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-20 | 60% | 20% |
| 2025-11-21 | 65% | 15% |
| 2025-11-22 | 70% | 10% |
| 2025-11-23 | 75% | 5% |

Overall, the sentiment data suggests that investors should be cautiously optimistic about AMD's prospects, given its strong financial performance and expanding product offerings. However, the ongoing supply chain disruptions pose a risk to the company's ability to meet demand, which may impact its stock price.
