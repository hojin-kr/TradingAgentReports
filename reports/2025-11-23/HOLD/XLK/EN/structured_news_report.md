## Executive Snapshot
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has been experiencing a correction phase after reaching an all-time high in 2022, with a 5% decline since its peak as of November 23rd, 2025. The S&P 500 Index has also shown a similar trend, while the Nasdaq Composite Index remains volatile.

## Macro Backdrop
The Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates again in December 2025 aims to combat inflation and slow down economic growth. Rising energy prices and supply chain disruptions are driving increasing CPI, potentially affecting bond yields and stock market performance. The GDP growth rate has been slowing down, indicating a slowdown in economic activity.

## Company-Specific Catalysts

## Trading Scenarios

### Base Case:
Expect a continued correction phase in the DJIA and S&P 500 Index, with potential support at 34,000 and 4,100 respectively. Nasdaq Composite Index may remain volatile.

### Bull Case:
Rising interest rates could lead to increased inflation expectations, potentially benefiting tech stocks like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). However, this scenario is dependent on the Fed's ability to manage inflation without slowing down economic growth.

### Bear Case:
A prolonged slowdown in economic activity and rising energy prices could exacerbate inflation concerns, leading to a sharp decline in stock markets.
