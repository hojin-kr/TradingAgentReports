# Investment Report: AMZN
## Executive Summary
I recommend selling 20% of Amazon (AMZN) stock due to concerns about market volatility, customer satisfaction, and innovation risks outweighing the benefits.

Key risks that could change the investment thesis:
- Market volatility: Continued price swings may impact our investment.
- Customer dissatisfaction: Alienation of customers due to changes in website or services could negatively affect AMZN's stock price.
