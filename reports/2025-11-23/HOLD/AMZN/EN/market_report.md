FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

The current trend of Amazon (AMZN) stock is characterized by a golden cross setup, which indicates a potential buying opportunity.

In the short term, the 10 EMA (close_10_ema) has crossed above the 50 SMA (close_50_sma), suggesting a bullish signal. However, considering the longer-term trend, the 200 SMA (close_200_sma) is still below the current price, indicating that the overall market trend remains bullish.

The RSI (rsi) indicator shows an oversold condition on November 10th, which may have been a buying opportunity for the stock. However, since then, the RSI has been in a neutral zone, suggesting that the stock is consolidating its gains.

The Bollinger Middle (boll) value of Amazon has been trending upwards, indicating increasing price movement. The upper band (boll_ub) and lower band (boll_lb) are also showing signs of strength, indicating potential breakout or reversal points.

Considering these indicators, I recommend a **BUY** strategy for Amazon stock with a target price range of $250-$300. Traders should monitor the stock's price movement closely and adjust their positions according to the RSI and Bollinger Bands' signals.

| Indicator | Value |
| --- | --- |
| close_10_ema | Above 50 SMA (Bullish signal) |
| close_200_sma | Below current price (Bullish trend) |
| rsi | Neutral zone |
| boll_ub | Showing signs of strength |
| boll_lb | Showing signs of strength |
