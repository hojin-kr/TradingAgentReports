I’m running into an issue pulling PLTR data from the data backend right now (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I attempted multiple date ranges, but the data source isn’t returning a file. This looks like a temporary backend problem rather than a user error. I can retry immediately, or you can specify a narrower window (e.g., last 90 days) or a specific date you care about. If you have a CSV you can share, I can analyze that directly as well.

In the meantime, here are the up-to-8 indicators I would select for a balanced, complementary view on PLTR, along with why they’re suitable for this market context:

Selected indicators (up to 8) and rationale
- close_50_sma
  - What it tells you: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s useful for PLTR: Helps confirm the ongoing trend when price is above/below the 50-day average and is useful when combined with faster signals to avoid false entries in choppy markets.
- close_200_sma
  - What it tells you: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major regime (bullish/bearish) and potential golden/death crosses.
  - Why it’s useful for PLTR: Provides strategic trend confirmation; especially relevant for evaluating sustained moves in a growth/name with potential regime shifts.
- close_10_ema
  - What it tells you: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action.
  - Why it’s useful for PLTR: Captures early momentum when combined with longer-term averages to filter noise in a volatile stock.
- macd
  - What it tells you: Momentum via the difference between two EMAs; crossovers signal potential trend changes.
  - Why it’s useful for PLTR: Helps catch shifts in trend momentum that may precede other confirmations; good for signaling entries/exits in moderate-volatility contexts.
- macds
  - What it tells you: MACD signal line; its crossovers with MACD provide potential trade signals.
  - Why it’s useful for PLTR: Complements the MACD line, reducing reliance on a single momentum signal and filtering false positives when market is range-bound.
- macdh
  - What it tells you: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence visuals.
  - Why it’s useful for PLTR: Adds depth to momentum assessment; divergences between price and MACD histogram can warn of waning momentum before price reverses.
- rsi
  - What it tells you: Relative strength momentum; overbought/oversold levels and potential divergences.
  - Why it’s useful for PLTR: Useful in both trending and side-ways regimes; helps spot exhaustion and potential reversals, especially when used with trend context (SMA 50/200).
- atr
  - What it tells you: Market volatility; typical true range-based measure to guide risk management.
  - Why it’s useful for PLTR: Informs position sizing and stop placement; helps adapt to changing volatility regimes that PLTR often experiences after news/events.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced narrative describing:
  - The current trend regime (short-term vs. long-term) using 50/200 SMA and 10 EMA.
  - Momentum context via MACD, MACD signal, and MACD histogram, including crossovers and divergences.
  - Overbought/oversold context with RSI and how it aligns or diverges from the trend/momentum signals.
  - Volatility framework using ATR to adjust risk controls and stop levels.
  - A consideration of volume-linked confirmation (I can add VWMA if you want a fifth dimension; I’ll keep to 8 as planned unless you request changes).
- Practical takeaways for PLTR, including:
  - Possible entry/exit signals with supporting indicators.
  - Risk management notes (where to place stops, how to size positions given ATR).
  - Potential confirmation or warning signals across indicators to avoid false positives.
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick review.

Proposed next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now. Do you want me to:
  1) Retry pulling PLTR data for the same window (2024-10-12 to 2025-10-12) or
  2) Use a shorter window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to get a faster result, or
  3) Use a window you specify?
- If you have a CSV or a specific date to anchor the analysis, share it and I’ll proceed immediately with the full 8-indicator report.

Note: The current date is 2025-10-12. Once data is available, I’ll generate a thorough, data-backed report and append a Markdown table summarizing the key insights and actions. If you’d like me to proceed with a specific window or alternative indicators (e.g., replace RSI with a different momentum measure like Stochastic RSI), tell me and I’ll adjust.

Would you like me to retry fetching PLTR data now with the same window, or would you prefer a smaller window (e.g., last 180 days) to get a result quickly?
