Recommendation: Hold Palantir (PLTR) for now.

Rationale
- Near-term risk factors dominate the headlines: valuation remains elevated relative to near-term profitability and cash-flow visibility, onboarding costs can stay elevated, and headline/regulatory risk persists given government exposure.
- The bull case for durable ARR growth, expanding gross margins from Foundry’s software mix, and AI-enabled workflow value is credible but not guaranteed to translate into quick, durable profitability.
- A cautious stance preserves optionality on upside catalysts (new verticals, larger commercial deployments, more predictable government awards) while limiting downside risk from potential missteps or delays.

Upgrade to Buy triggers (milestones that would justify re-rating)
- ARR growth sustained at roughly 18–25% year over year with improving net retention and a clear path to positive free cash flow within 6–12 quarters.
- Gross margins expanding toward the mid-high 70s to 80% range as Foundry mix sharpens and professional-services tailwinds moderate.
- Material increase in commercial bookings beyond pilots, with lower onboarding costs per seat and shorter sales cycles in at least two new verticals (e.g., healthcare, energy).
- Government revenue trajectory stabilizing with multiple large, paid, multi-year awards showing early ARR recognition.

Position management and risk controls
- Maintain a disciplined, smaller-than-full allocation to PLTR.
- Avoid aggressive breakouts; use multi-signal validation (trend, momentum, volatility) before adding.
- Consider staged entry only on confirmed positive signals aligning with the upgrade criteria.

Risk management options
- Use ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.0–1.5 ATR below entry) and adjust with volatility.
- Hedge selectively (collar or vertical call spread; small put hedge) to protect downside while preserving upside.

Monitoring cadence
- Quarterly review of ARR growth, margins, cash flow, and government/commercial mix shifts.
- If milestones stall for two consecutive quarters, re-evaluate the risk-reward and consider trimming or reinterpreting the thesis.

Lessons applied
- Don’t rely on a single bullish signal; require a multi-signal confirmation before escalating.
- Demand credible cash-flow visibility and margin expansion before increasing exposure.
- Treat regulatory headlines as ongoing risk factors; ensure diversification of revenue mix mitigates, but doesn’t eliminate, exposure.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
