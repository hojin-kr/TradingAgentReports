I tried to fetch the Reddit data for PLTR on 2025-10-12, but the Reddit tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can either retry the data pull now or proceed with a best-effort analysis using other signals and outline how I’ll incorporate Reddit data as soon as the tool is available.

What would you like to do?
- Retry now: I’ll re-attempt to pull the Reddit data for PLTR for 2025-10-12 and then deliver a full, detailed report with a Markdown summary table at the end.
- Proceed with a framework: I’ll deliver a comprehensive analysis using sentiment, news, and general context (clearly labeling where Reddit data is pending) and provide a fill-in-ready Markdown table to populate once Reddit data comes in.

If you choose to proceed with the framework, here is the plan I will follow and the structure I’ll deliver (I’ll fill in the actual Reddit sentiment and counts as soon as the tool is back up):

- Executive snapshot (today’s read on PLTR through the lens of social sentiment and news)
  - Quick sentiment tilt (overall positive/negative/neutral)
  - Notable catalysts driving sentiment this week (e.g., product updates, government contracts, earnings hints)

- Daily sentiment timeline (past 7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment score (e.g., +0.15 means positive tilt)
  - Key themes by day (e.g., “Government contract discussion,” “AI/data integration,” “competition concerns”)

- News and catalysts (past week)
  - Summary of major headlines (company announcements, partnerships, regulatory updates, earnings hints)
  - Market impact notes (how the news moved the stock or sentiment)

- Thematic sentiment deep-dive
  - AI/PLTR positioning and client reactions
  - Competitive landscape and differentiation
  - Public concerns (security, data privacy, procurement bottlenecks)

- Risk and opportunity assessment
  - Key risk factors to watch (federal procurement cycles, budget constraints, tech competition)
  - Potential catalysts that could shift sentiment positively or negatively (new contracts, product launches, earnings signals)

- Trading implications and scenarios
  - Short-term (days to weeks): bullish/bearish sentiment signals and price reaction patterns to watch
  - Intermediate term (1–3 months): narrative shifts, deployment of Palantir products, and contract wins/losses

- Data quality notes
  - Acknowledgement of data gaps (specifically Reddit data pending) and how I’ll adjust once available

- Markdown table (end of report)
  - A clear, organized table summarizing key points: sentiment trend, major catalysts, news headlines, risk factors, and actionable signals

If you want me to proceed immediately with the framework above, say “Proceed,” and I’ll deliver the full report and a ready-to-fill Markdown table. If you prefer, I can retry the Reddit data pull first and then deliver the complete, data-backed report in one go.
