# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD has strong long-term AI and data-center potential. Near-term catalysts are uncertain, so a disciplined Hold with a clear path to Buy balances upside against timing risk.

## Investment Decision
HOLD. Confidence: Medium. Upgrade to Buy only after durable data-center margin expansion, credible ROCm adoption, and a sustained technical breakout.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Long-run opportunity is solid: AI and data-center demand could drive meaningful growth over several years.
- Platform breadth matters: AMDâ€™s mix of CPUs, GPUs, and Xilinx accelerators offers advantages across training, inference, and other workloads, not just a single product.
- Open software edge: ROCm and an open ecosystem could reduce switching costs and broaden deployment, potentially helping share gains.
- Margin and cash flow upside potential: If data-center demand strengthens and ROCm traction grows, margins and free cash flow could rise, supporting capital returns.
- Need for multi-signal proof: Upgrading to Buy requires durable, multi-quarter progress across margins, ROCm traction, and technical setup; a single positive datapoint is not enough.

## Risks To Watch
- AI cycle durability risk: Growth could slow, capex could pause, or deployments optimize in ways that limit near-term upside.
- Nvidia moat and ROCm uncertainty: CUDA remains dominant in many workflows; ROCm adoption is not assured at scale.
- Data-center mix and PC cycle sensitivity: A slower hyperscale or enterprise capex cycle could offset margin gains.
- Supply chain and execution risk: Lead times, capacity constraints, and costs could re-emerge; Xilinx/software integration challenges remain.
- Valuation and timing risk: Even with a long horizon, near-term catalysts may falter and valuations may stay stretched.
