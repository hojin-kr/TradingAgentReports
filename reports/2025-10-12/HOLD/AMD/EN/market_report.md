I attempted to fetch AMD data, but the data source returned a FileNotFoundError (the backend data fetcher isn’t available right now). I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with a solid indicator plan you can use once the data is retrieved. Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators (8 total) that are complementary and suitable for AMD’s typical market context (semiconductors/AI cycle, higher volatility, earnings-driven moves):

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance
  - Why suitable for AMD: Helps identify the prevailing trend direction amid AI/semiconductor cycles and potential pullbacks after rallies.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Long-term trend; major regime signal (bullish/bearish context)
  - Why suitable for AMD: Confirms overall market regime and can flag longer-term trend changes (e.g., golden/death cross scenarios).
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum; sensitive to recent price moves
  - Why suitable for AMD: Captures quick shifts around earnings, product announcements, or AI demand news; useful for tighter entries/exits when used with longer-term filters.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; trend-change signals
  - Why suitable for AMD: Helps spot momentum crossovers around catalysts; works well when combined with other filters to avoid false signals in choppy markets.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD Signal line
  - Why suitable for AMD: Filter for MACD crossovers; reduces false positives and smooths decision criteria.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD Histogram (momentum strength)
  - Why suitable for AMD: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential; useful for spotting early momentum shifts that may precede price moves.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - What it measures: Relative momentum; overbought/oversold conditions
  - Why suitable for AMD: Helps gauge potential reversals after big moves; divergence can signal waning momentum even as price trends persist.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it measures: Averaged true range; market volatility level
  - Why suitable for AMD: Critical for risk management and position sizing in a high-volatility stock; informs stop-placement and dynamic risk controls.

Brief note on how these pieces fit together
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to establish the broader trend regime. Look for alignment (e.g., price above both and 50SMA above 200SMA) for bullish bias.
- Momentum timing: Use macd, macds, macdh, and rsi to time entries and exits within the established trend. MACD components help confirm shifts, while RSI provides overbought/oversold context and potential reversals or continuations.
- Risk management: Use atr to scale stops and position sizes according to current volatility. This is especially important for AMD during periods of AI-cycle headlines, earnings, or supply/demand news.
- Complementary checks: The combination avoids relying on a single signal. For example, a bullish MACD cross supported by price above the 50/200 SMAs and RSI not overbought would be more robust than a MACD cross alone.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching AMD data now and then generate a detailed, data-driven trends report using these indicators.
- If you’d rather proceed immediately with a qualitative framework, I can provide a structured interpretation guide (entry/exit criteria, risk notes) based on these indicators as a template, and fill in the precise readings once data is available.

Markdown table of key points
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use (AMD context) | Trade signal nuance (example) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend | Confirm direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA suggests bullish bias. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend | Regime confirmation; trend strength | Price above 200SMA and 50SMA alignment strengthens uptrend case. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Capture quick shifts; early entry signals | Cross above/below price can indicate near-term entries; filter with longer SMAs. |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum/trend-change signals | Identify trend changes; screen for crossovers | MACD line crossing above zero + price above key SMAs is a stronger setup. |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD Signal line | Validate MACD cross with smoother signal | MACD crossing above MACD Signal reinforces bullish bias when other conditions align. |
| macdh | MACD Related | MACD Histogram momentum strength | Visualize momentum strength and divergence potential | Increasing histogram with price confirmation supports continuation signals. |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum; overbought/oversold | Gauge potential reversals; avoid overtrading in strong trends | RSI near extremes (>70 or <30) warrants confirmation with trend and MACD. |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility level | Risk management; set stops and sizing | Rising ATR implies wider stops; consider reducing position size or widening risk controls. |

Important note on data retrieval
- The data fetch for AMD currently encounters a backend file-not-found error. I can:
  1) Retry fetching AMD data now, or
  2) Proceed with the indicator framework (above) and generate a concrete, data-driven trends report as soon as the data is available.

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry fetching AMD data now?
- Or would you prefer I proceed with the indicator framework and deliver the full trends interpretation once data comes back?
