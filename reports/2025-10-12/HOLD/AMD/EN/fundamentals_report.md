Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch AMD’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) for 2025-10-12, but the data retrieval tools returned a FileNotFoundError. That means the data sources aren’t accessible right now, so I can’t generate the full, data-driven report at this moment.

What I can do right now
- Provide a comprehensive report framework you can use once data access is restored.
- Fill in a detailed, fine-grained analysis plan with the exact metrics to extract and how to interpret them for traders.
- Include a ready-to-fill Markdown table template at the end to organize key points.

Comprehensive AMD fundamental report framework (what I will deliver once data is available)
1) Company profile and business model
- Business segments: data center and gaming/PC personnel, embedded/other
- Revenue mix by segment, geography, and major customers if disclosed
- Competitive positioning, key suppliers, and product cycles (CPU/GPU/AI accelerators)

2) Financial snapshot (latest period)
- Revenue, gross margin, operating margin, operating income, net income
- Earnings per share (basic/diluted), EBITDA where available
- Year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter trends
- Cash and equivalents, debt levels, and liquidity metrics (current ratio, quick ratio)

3) Income statement deep dive (trend analysis)
- Revenue growth drivers (data center AI demand, gaming GPU refresh cycles, conscription of new product launches)
- Margin analysis: gross margin pressure (cost of wafer/ASICs, supply chain inflation), operating margin drivers (R&D intensity, SG&A)
- R&D intensity (R&D as % of revenue) and its implications for future product roadmap

4) Balance sheet highlights
- Cash position and net debt (if any)
- Inventory levels and turnover
- Accounts receivable/payable dynamics
- Long-term debt structure and maturities

5) Cash flow analysis
- Operating cash flow vs net income (quality of earnings)
- Free cash flow generation
- Capital expenditures and buybacks/dividends (capital allocation stance)

6) Insider sentiment and insider transactions
- Summary of sentiment signals over the past 15 days
- Notable insider buys/sells, concentrations, and potential confidence signals
- Any unusual activity or patterns relative to historical baselines

7) Sector and macro context
- AI/compute demand tailwinds and capex cycles
- Competitive landscape (NVIDIA, Intel, etc.) and AMD’s share gains/losses
- Potential risks: supply constraints, wafer pricing, geopolitical/regulatory factors

8) Risk factors and caveats
- Execution risk on product launches (e.g., new GPU/CPU generations)
- Dependency on foundry partnerships and ecosystem support
- Market sensitivity to PC demand and data center capex cycles

9) Traders’ takeaways and scenarios
- Bull case, base case, and bear case based on the data
- Key catalysts to watch (product launches, quarterly guidance, AI deployment trends)
- Concrete trade ideas aligned with the data (e.g., earnings-driven moves, catalyst duration, risk controls)

10) Appendices
- Definitions of metrics used
- Data sources and any assumptions

Markdown table template (ready to populate with actual data)
- You can paste the latest figures once the data fetch works

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval as soon as the data sources are accessible again. If you’d like, I can attempt automatic re-fetch after a brief wait, or you can prompt me to retry on a schedule.
- If you have alternative data you want me to use (e.g., you can paste the latest quarterly figures, or allow me to pull from SEC filings manually), I can build the full report from that data.
- I can also provide a qualitative AMD snapshot based on typical drivers and risks, clearly labeled as non-current data, until the live data is available.

Would you like me to:
- Retry the data fetch automatically in a few minutes, or
- Proceed with a qualitative AMD fundamental overview using generally known factors (clearly noted as of last public data, not current to 2025-10-12), or
- Have you paste the latest figures so I can assemble the full report right away?
