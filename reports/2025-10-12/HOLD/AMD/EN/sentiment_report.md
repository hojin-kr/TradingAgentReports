Sorry about that — I attempted to fetch Reddit stock info for AMD for 2025-10-12, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal data access issue). I can’t pull the latest Reddit sentiment data right now.

Here are your options, and I can proceed with any you choose:

- Option A: Retry now
  - I’ll try the Reddit data fetch again immediately and then proceed with the full long-form report (social sentiment across Reddit, daily sentiment levels, and key threads), plus news signals and implications for traders.

- Option B: Proceed with alternative sources
  - I can build a comprehensive AMD analysis using available public news headlines, earnings news, product announcements, partnerships, and general social sentiment from other platforms (e.g., Twitter/X, YouTube comments, financial forums) if you’d like me to approximate sentiment without Reddit.

- Option C: Prepare a framework now
  - I can deliver the full analysis framework and methodology, plus a detailed outline, so you can review while I retry or collect from other sources. This would include:
    - Executive snapshot
    - 7-day sentiment trend (per platform if available)
    - Topic clusters driving sentiment (e.g., product launches, AI accelerators, supply chain, competition)
    - Notable catalysts and risks
    - Technicals and price context
    - Trader implications and move hypotheses
    - A Markdown table summarizing key points (as requested)

What would you like me to do? If you want Option A, I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch now and then proceed with the full report. If you prefer Option B or C, I’ll start building the report framework or gather alternative sources right away.
