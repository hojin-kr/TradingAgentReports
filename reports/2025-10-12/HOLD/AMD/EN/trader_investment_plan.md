Recommendation: Hold

Rationale:
- Near-term setup remains indecisive. The AMD bull case (AI tailwinds, platform breadth, ROCm openness) is compelling over multi-year horizons, but near-term signals have not yet aligned to justify new long exposure.
- Key risks highlighted in the plan persist: potential AI capex pacing,竞争 from Nvidia’s ecosystem, ROCm adoption uncertainty, data-center mix risk, and ongoing supply/execution considerations. Until these risks are meaningfully resolved with stronger data-center margin momentum and clearer ROCm traction, adding risk today is better avoided.
- The plan’s guardrails still apply: a multi-signal confluence is required to upgrade to Buy. Specifically, we should wait for:
  - Data signals: sustained data-center revenue growth with margin expansion and improved free cash flow quality (positive FCF, reduced working capital drag).
  - Technical signals: price above 50-day and 200-day SMAs with 50-day above 200-day, MACD bullish and crossing, RSI in a healthy mid-range, and a close above the 10-day EMA.
  - Fundamental signals: clearer ROCm adoption across major workloads and improved supply-chain visibility (lead times/downside risk mitigated).

Operational plan if you’re already in or considering entry:
- If you already hold AMD, keep risk controls tight: tighten stops using ATR-based levels to protect against downside in volatile AI news cycles.
- Avoid adding new long exposure until the multi-signal Buy criteria are satisfied.
- Monitor the follow-on data closely: quarterly data-center margins, cash-flow quality, and any evidence of ROCm deployment gains. If these deteriorate, reassess.

What would trigger an upgrade to Buy?
- The exact, multi-factor convergence outlined above: confirmed data-center margin expansion, free cash flow improvement, ROCm adoption gains, and the technical setup clearly fulfilled (price and momentum signals align as described).

Final stance summary:
- Hold now with a defined, trigger-based path to Buy if and when the data and signals converge convincingly. Until then, wait for stronger evidence and avoid chasing headlines or single data points.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
