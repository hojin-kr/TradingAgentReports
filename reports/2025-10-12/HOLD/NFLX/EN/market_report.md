Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch NFLX data to generate the indicator report, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError for get_YFin_data (data source issue). I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with a clearly defined framework so we’re ready to run the analysis as soon as the data is available. Here’s what I propose and what I can deliver once the data is retrieved.

What happened
- Data fetch failure: get_YFin_data returned FileNotFoundError. This prevents generating the 8-indicator setup and a detailed trend report right now.
- Next steps: I can retry immediately, try a shorter date range (e.g., last 6–12 months), or wait for your go-ahead to retry. If you prefer, I can also outline the exact analysis plan and indicators we’ll use so we’re ready to execute the moment data is accessible.

Recommended 8-indicator setup (diverse, non-redundant)
- close_10_ema: Captures short-term momentum and quick shifts; useful for early entry/exit intuition when combined with longer-term trends.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the broader trend direction.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend anchor; confirms overarching market regime; useful for filtering signals and avoiding churning in counter-trend moves.
- macd: Momentum/allowing crossovers to signal potential trend changes; complements trend with momentum context.
- macds: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD provide trading triggers within the trend context.
- macdh: MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential; helps assess the strength of a move.
- rsi: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold cues (and potential divergences) to flag reversals or continuation risks within the trend.
- atr: Volatility measure to calibrate risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and to interpret how wide price swings may be.

How I will present the final report (once data is available)
- A detailed, nuanced narrative of NFLX’s price action, breaking down:
  - Trend direction (short-, medium-, long-term) using the 10 EMA, 50 SMA, and 200 SMA relationships.
  - Momentum shifts (MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram, RSI) with crossovers/divergences and their implications in NFLX’s current regime.
  - Volatility context (ATR, Bollinger-related insights if applicable) to frame risk and stop levels.
  - Price-position evidence (how price relates to the moving averages and to recent highs/lows) to assess support/resistance and breakout potential.
- Actionable takeaways that are informative without being prescriptive as a final buy/sell recommendation. The aim is to help you judge entry/exit timing and risk management with a clear rationale.

What I need from you
- Do you want me to retry data retrieval now, preferably with a shorter window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to get a quick turnaround?
- If you’d rather, I can proceed with the framework and placeholder observations, and fill in the actual values as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Appendix: Indicator roles (summary table)
Indicator | What it measures | Why it’s relevant for NFLX
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum; quick trend shifts | Early signals of momentum changes; useful for timely entries when paired with longer trends
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Confirms the broader trend and helps filter noisy signals
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Helps determine regime (bullish/bearish) and avoid counter-trend trades
- macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Crossover signals of trend changes; adds depth to trend assessment
- macds | MACD signal line | Crossovers with MACD line trigger potential entries/exits within trend
- macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength; divergence clues; complements MACD signals
- rsi | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | Divergence and extreme readings help anticipate reversals within the trend
- atr | Volatility magnitude | Guides risk management (stops, position sizing) and contextualizes price moves

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and proceed to generate the detailed, point-by-point analysis with a Markdown table summarizing the observations and recommended interpretations.
