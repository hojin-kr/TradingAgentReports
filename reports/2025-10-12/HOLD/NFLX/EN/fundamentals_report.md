I tried to fetch NFLX data for insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financial statements, but the tool environment returned a FileNotFoundError (backend data sources appear misconfigured or temporarily unavailable). Specifically, all attempted tool calls failed with:

- Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

Because of this, I don’t have any actual numbers to report right now.

What would you like to do next?

Options
- Retry now: I can attempt the data fetch again in the same session (or retry after a short delay) to see if the backend recovers.
- Use a fallback plan: I can draft a comprehensive report structure with placeholders and clearly labeled gaps, so we can fill in the numbers as soon as the data sources come back online.
- Proceed with a qualitative framework: I can provide a detailed, trader-focused qualitative analysis of NFLX fundamentals (key drivers, risk factors, historical context, and what to watch in upcoming filings) and include a ready-to-fill template for the actual figures once access is restored.
- Provide manual guidance: I can outline exactly which data points to extract from Netflix’s latest filings (10-Q/10-K, earnings releases, and insider filings) and a checklist for what to look for, so you or another assistant can plug in the numbers when the data sources are up.

If you’d like, I can start withOption A (retry) or B (fallback template) right away. If you choose a qualitative approach, I’ll cover:
- Company profile and business model (segments, geography, subscriber dynamics)
- Revenue and profitability trends (revenue mix, gross margin, operating margin, EBITDA, net income)
- Cash flow position (operating cash flow, free cash flow, capex intensity)
- Balance sheet health (debt, liquidity, working capital)
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (interpretation of recent activity)
- Recent risk factors and catalysts (content strategy, competition, user growth / churn, ARPU evolution)
- Key takeaways for traders, with a structured table at the end for quick reference

Tell me how you’d like to proceed.
