Sorry about that — it looks like the Reddit data tool failed with a FileNotFoundError for NFLX on 2025-10-12. I can retry the data pull now, or if you’d prefer, I can proceed with a high-level framework and fill in the Reddit sentiment data as soon as the tool returns.

Here are two options:
- Option A: Retry now and then deliver the full long-form report with day-by-day sentiment, themes, and a final Markdown table.
- Option B: Proceed with an outlined framework right away (without the Reddit feed yet), so you have the structure and methodology, and I’ll complete the data-dependent parts as soon as the tool comes back.

What would you like to do? In the meantime, here’s how the final report will be structured and what to expect once the data is in.

What the full report will cover (when Reddit data is available)
- Executive snapshot
  - Net sentiment trend over the past 7 days
  - Overall mood (bullish vs bearish) and notable sentiment spikes
  - Key drivers (e.g., earnings, product news, price moves, regulatory headlines)

- Daily sentiment delta and themes
  - Day-by-day sentiment scores (e.g., net positive vs negative) with sources (Reddit threads, mentions)
  - Top themes by day (e.g., ad-supported rollout, subscriber growth, price moves, streaming competition)

- News and narrative context
  - Summary of recent NFLX news (earnings, product updates, content announcements, partnerships)
  - How sentiment aligns with or diverges from news events

- Sentiment drivers and risk signals
  - Product/feature adoption chatter (e.g., user experience, pricing changes)
  - Competitive landscape observations (competition, market chatter)
  - Major risk factors reflected in social chatter (e.g., churn concerns, content costs, ARPU changes)

- Trader-oriented implications
  - Short-term catalysts to watch this week
  - Potential inflection points (support/resistance in sentiment, mention spikes)
  - Positioning cues for options vs. stock trades (based on sentiment momentum vs. news cadence)

- Data limitations and caveats
  - Source coverage, potential biases in Reddit discourse
  - How sentiment is normalized and any gaps in coverage

- Markdown summary table (final section)
  - Key points organized for quick scanning with columns like:
    - Theme / Driver
    - Sentiment (Bullish/Bearish)
    - Relevance to price/volatility
    - Last 7-day trend
    - Notable data source or post example

If you want me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll run the Reddit data pull for NFLX for 2025-10-12 and then deliver the full report with the Markdown table appended at the end. If you prefer Option B, I’ll draft the full framework now and populate the data as soon as the tool returns the results.
