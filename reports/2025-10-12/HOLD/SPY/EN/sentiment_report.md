Thanks for the patience. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based stock sentiment for SPY on 2025-10-12, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal backend issue). I can retry, but I don’t want to block you. Here are your options and how I can proceed now:

What I can do right away
- Prepare a comprehensive, trader-focused report on SPY using available public signals beyond Reddit (news headlines, macro drivers, sentiment proxies, and typical ETF-flow/technical considerations), clearly noting where Reddit data would be incorporated once the tool is back online.
- Provide a structured long-form analysis with actionable takeaways, risk flags, and scenarios for traders, plus a Makrdown table at the end to summarize key points.

If you’d like me to retry the Reddit data fetch
- I can attempt another fetch for SPY on 2025-10-12 and then immediately synthesize the sentiment once it returns. If the error persists, I’ll switch to the non-Reddit data approach and clearly label gaps.

If you’d prefer to proceed now with a complete analysis (without Reddit data for this run)
- I’ll deliver a thorough report focusing on:
  - Macro/news landscape driving SPY (Fed policy expectations, inflation signals, geopolitical/economic news, major earnings or macro reports if any in the past week)
  - Sentiment proxies (e.g., overall bullish/bearish tone from headlines and major financial outlets, ETF flow signals, options activity) with caveats about data sources
  - Technical posture (price action context, moving averages, volatility regime if available)
  - Risks and catalysts (federal stance shifts, macro surprises, sector rotation, liquidity conditions)
  - Trade implications and scenarios (bullets for bullish, bearish, and neutral environments)
  - A concise, reader-friendly Makrdown table at the end

Please tell me which route you want:
1) I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then produce the full report with Reddit sentiment included.
2) I proceed immediately with a Reddit-gaps-aware, non-Reddit-focused long report (clearly noting the missing Reddit data).
3) I provide just the report skeleton now (outline + placeholders) and fill in Reddit data later when the tool is available.

In the meantime, here’s a draft outline I can start with if you pick option 2 or 3 (the final version will include data-driven insights wherever available):

Draft report outline (to be populated with data)
- Executive snapshot: Key takeaways for SPY in the past week, sentiment drift, and immediate risk/rotations.
- What moved SPY this week: Top macro drivers, notable headlines, policy signals, earnings (if any), and geopolitical events.
- Public sentiment overview (excluding Reddit if needed): Synthesis from mainstream media, blogs, and OTC/social sentiment proxies; directional bias and confidence levels.
- ETF-specific dynamics: Liquidity, fund flows, index rebalancing activity, options positioning cues, implied volatility context.
- Technicals and risk framework: Trend direction, support/resistance levels, volatility regime, drawdown risk, correlation with major indices.
- Scenarios and trading implications: 
  - Bullish scenario: catalysts, entry/exit levels, risk controls
  - Bearish scenario: catalysts, entry/exit levels, risk controls
  - Neutral/unclear: hedging ideas and monitoring triggers
- Quant-tactical notes: short bullet list of indicators or signals to watch (with thresholds).
- Key takeaways and watchlist: 3–5 high-priority points and a small watchlist of data/events to monitor.
- Appendix: Data sources and caveats; explicit note about Reddit data status if applicable.
- Makrdown table: A clean, easy-to-scan summary of the key points (one row per category, with headlines like: Sentiment tilt, Main drivers, Technical posture, Risk flags, Trade ideas).

If you confirm your preferred option, I’ll proceed accordingly and deliver the full, trader-ready report with the requested Markdown table at the end.
