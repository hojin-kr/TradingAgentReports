I attempted to fetch QQQ data from Yahoo Finance for 2023-10-12 to 2025-10-12, but the data service returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). This looks like a backend issue with the data path, not an issue with your ticker. I can retry now, or you can allow me to proceed with a qualitative analysis and the indicator plan once the data is available. For now, here’s the plan I would run once the data is accessible, plus why these indicators are well-suited for QQQ in this context.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, chosen for complementary insight and non-redundancy)
- close_50_sma (Moving Average)
  Why: Identifies the medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm if the price is above/below the mid-term trend and can be used to corroborate other momentum signals.
- close_200_sma (Moving Average)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful to confirm whether the market is in a broad uptrend or downtrend and to spot golden/death cross setups when combined with shorter-term averages.
- close_10_ema (Moving Average)
  Why: A responsive short-term trend/momentum gauge. Useful for timing around trend shifts and for capturing quicker entry/exit points when used with longer-term filters.
- macd (MACD)
  Why: Core momentum measure showing the difference between fast and slow MACDs. Crossovers and histogram shifts help identify trend changes and momentum strength in a market like QQQ, which is tech-heavy.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: The signal line for MACD. Its crossovers with the MACD line provide cleaner trigger points and help reduce false signals when used with other indicators.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  Why: Visualizes momentum divergence and strength. The histogram can reveal momentum changes ahead of MACD/crossover signals.
- rsi (RSI)
  Why: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Helpful to identify potential pullbacks in overextended stretches, while cross-checking with trend direction to avoid false reversals in strong uptrends.
- atr (ATR)
  Why: Volatility gauge that informs risk management (volatility-based stops and position sizing). In volatile phases common to tech-heavy indices, ATR helps adjust risk controls and stop placement.

How I will analyze (when data is available)
- Trend context: Compare current price to 50_SMA and 200_SMA to infer whether QQQ is in a bullish, bearish, or range-bound regime. Look for crossovers of the price with these averages as potential trend confirmations.
- Momentum dynamics: Inspect MACD line, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram for crossovers and momentum shifts. Use RSI to confirm overbought/oversold conditions and look for divergence with price relative to the trend.
- Momentum/volatility harmony: Use RSI with MACD signals to distinguish sustainable momentum runs from sharp pullbacks. Use ATR to gauge current volatility and adapt stop-loss and position sizing accordingly.
- Signal coherence: Require alignment across at least two trend/momentum indicators (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA with a MACD bullish signal and RSI not in extreme overbought territory) before considering entries. Use ATR to scale risk during high-volatility periods.

What I would deliver in a full report (once data is fetched)
- A nuanced, date-stamped assessment of QQQ’s trend direction, momentum, and volatility.
- The current relationship of price to 50_SMA and 200_SMA with notes on any golden/death-cross implications.
- MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram readings with interpretation of momentum strength and potential turning points.
- RSI level and any notable divergences with price or MACD signals.
- ATR-based volatility context and implications for risk management.
- A concise set of actionable signals or conditioning rules (e.g., “if price above 50_SMA, MACD bullish crossover within the last 5 days, RSI not overbought, and ATR increasing, consider a long exposure with a volatility-adjusted stop.”)

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data immediately. Would you like me to attempt another data pull for QQQ now, or would you prefer to proceed with a qualitative plan (as above) and run the actual indicator analysis once data access is restored?
- If you can permit an alternative data source or provide a CSV with QQQ price data, I can proceed right away and deliver the full, detailed indicator-driven report with the table.
