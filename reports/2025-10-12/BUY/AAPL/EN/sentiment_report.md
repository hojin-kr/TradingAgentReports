Thanks for the nudge. I’m hitting a tool error right now with the Reddit data fetch (FileNotFoundError) for AAPL on 2025-10-12. It looks like the data source backend is unavailable at the moment, so I can’t pull the latest Reddit sentiment directly right this second.

Here are two options to keep things moving. please tell me which you prefer:
Option 1 — Retry now and pull data when the tool is back
- I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again immediately and then produce a detailed, data-backed long report analyzing social media sentiment (per day) plus recent company news, with trader-focused insights and a clear risk/driver matrix.

Option 2 — Proceed with a comprehensive qualitative report using a robust framework (no live Reddit data)
- I’ll deliver a full, trader-focused report structure that explains how sentiment, news, and catalysts for AAPL typically interplay, plus explicit methodology, what to watch in the last week, and a ready-to-fill template for data you’ll provide or that I can fetch once the tool is up again. This includes a detailed MakrMarkdown-ready table at the end of the final report.

If you’d like me to proceed immediately with Option 2, I’ll produce:
- Executive snapshot of current sentiment and potential implications
- Core themes likely to drive chatter (e.g., product cycle, services growth, supply chain, regulatory, macro factors)
- Newsflow scan approach (what headlines to monitor and why they matter for AAPL)
- Daily sentiment framework (how to quantify and categorize sentiment day-by-day)
- Price/action & risk overlay (how sentiment tends to map to intraday/mid-term moves)
- Trader-oriented takeaways (catalysts to watch, risk factors, and scenarios)
- A clean, ready-to-fill data table skeleton (Date, Daily Sentiment, Top Themes, Notable Headlines, Price Action, Implied Vol, Confidence)

Either way, I’ll also append a Markdown table at the end of the final report to organize key points clearly.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry Option 1 right away, I’ll do that now.
