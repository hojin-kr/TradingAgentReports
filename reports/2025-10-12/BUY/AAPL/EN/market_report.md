I attempted to fetch data and the associated indicators for AAPL, but the data retrieval step returned a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can retry fetching the data now, or if you prefer, I can proceed with a high-confidence indicator setup and provide a detailed framework for interpretation once the data is available. Below is a thorough indicator-driven analysis plan for AAPL using eight complementary indicators. I’ve selected indicators to maximize information diversity (trend, momentum, volatility, and price envelopes) while avoiding redundant signals.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale for AAPL
1) close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average)
- What it measures: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Helps confirm the intermediate trend amid earnings cycles and product launch volatility. AAPL often trends in multi-week to multi-month horizons, so the 50SMA is a practical anchor.
- How to use: Look for price trading above/below the 50SMA as a trend signal; consider crossovers with shorter averages (e.g., 10EMA) for entry/exit timing.

2) close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average)
- What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark; major support/resistance level.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Establishes the larger market regime (bullish/bearish) and is useful around macro shifts or long-cycle catalysts (iPhone cycles, AI initiatives, regulatory moves).
- How to use: Confirm trend direction when price is above/below 200SMA; watch for “golden cross” or “death cross” with shorter moving averages for strategic bias rather than frequent timing signals.

3) close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average)
- What it measures: Short-term momentum and price reactivity.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Captures quick shifts around catalysts (earnings, product events, market surprises). More responsive than the 50SMA, but less stable than longer-term averages.
- How to use: Use as a trigger line in combination with longer-term trends (e.g., price above 50SMA and 200SMA) to identify early entry points; be cautious in choppy markets.

4) macd (MACD line)
- What it measures: Momentum via differences between short and long EMAs; trend-change signal.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Apple often exhibits clear momentum shifts on earnings and product announcements; MACD helps detect these shifts and potential divergence.
- How to use: Look for crossovers of the MACD line with the MACD signal, plus convergence/divergence with price action. Use as a corroborating signal rather than a sole entry trigger.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- What it measures: Smoothing of MACD line; helps reduce false positives.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: When MACD crosses above/below its signal line, it strengthens momentum-based signals.
- How to use: Use MACD line cross with MACDS as a trigger in conjunction with price-driven confirmations (e.g., price above 50SMA).

6) rsi (RSI)
- What it measures: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: In strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; in downtrends, it can stay oversold. Helps spot potential reversals when used with trend context.
- How to use: Key levels around 70/30; look for bullish/bearish divergence with price, particularly when price interacts with major moving averages. Always cross-check with trend signals to avoid overtrading in strong trends.

7) boll (Bollinger Middle)
- What it measures: The 20-period moving average around which volatility bands are built.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Provides a clean reference for mean reversion and dynamic support/resistance around a focal price level (20SMA). Also helps assess price relative to its typical range.
- How to use: Exchange between price lying near the middle line and touching/expanding bands for breakout or mean-reversion signals. Use with other momentum/volatility signals for confirmation.

8) atr (Average True Range)
- What it measures: Market volatility (range-based measure).
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Useful for sizing positions and setting stop distances around earnings, product cycle announcements, or tech sector shifts when volatility spikes.
- How to use: Use ATR to determine stop-loss placement and adapt position sizing to current volatility; combine with trend signals to avoid premature stops during high-volatility periods.

How to interpret and combine signals (nuanced, non-redundant approach)
- Trend confirmation framework:
  - If price is above the 200SMA (bullish regime) and the 50SMA is also above the 200SMA (golden-cross-like context), prioritize momentum signals from MACD/macd and RSI to time entries when the 10EMA confirms rising momentum.
  - If price is below the 200SMA (bearish regime), treat long entries with caution; look for MACD/MACDS bearish signals and RSI moving away from overbought territory to avoid chasing rallies.

- Entry timing:
  - Look for a confluence where price climbs above the 10EMA while price remains above the 50SMA, and MACD line crosses above its signal line with RSI confirming momentum (rising but not oversold).
  - In uptrends, occasional pullbacks to the 50SMA or near the 20SMA (boll middle) can provide lower-risk entries if MACD is turning positive and RSI is not diverging negatively.

- Volatility management:
  - Use ATR to set stop distances that reflect current market volatility, especially around earnings dates or major product announcements.
  - If ATR expands sharply, reduce position size or widen stops to avoid premature exits; if ATR contracts, you may tighten stops but still require multiple confirmations (e.g., MACD/MACDS alignment).

- Reversion vs breakout context:
  - Boll (20SMA) with price touching or riding the upper/lower Bollinger bands can signal potential breakouts or mean reversion. Confirm with MACD momentum and RSI levels to avoid false breakouts in choppy markets.

Notes and caveats
- Apple (AAPL) tends to exhibit powerful moves around earnings, product launches, and broad market risk appetite. Treat earnings weeks as high-volatility windows; rely more on volatility-aware stop placement (ATR) and longer-term trend context (200SMA, 50SMA) rather than chasing rapid intraday moves.
- Avoid relying on a single momentum indicator. The combination of MACD, MACDS, and RSI helps filter signals; adjust thresholds during strong trends (where RSI can stay overbought or oversold longer than expected).
- If you desire, I can re-run data fetches and provide a data-driven, numbers-backed interpretation once the data library is accessible.

Next steps
- I can retry retrieving the full data set and generate the indicator readouts as soon as the data tool is available again.
- If you’d prefer, I can adapt the indicator set (e.g., swap RSI for Stochastic RSI or add VWMA for volume confirmation) depending on your risk tolerance and trading style.

Appendix: Key points at a glance (table)
