Thanks for the prompt. I ran into a backend data retrieval issue while trying to fetch TSLA fundamentals for 2025-10-12. Specifically, parallel requests (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) failed with a FileNotFoundError. Individual attempts to fetch insider sentiment also エrrored. It looks like the data store behind these tools is temporarily unavailable.

What this means right now
- I cannot pull the latest weekly insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the most recent quarterly financial statements at the moment.
- I can’t produce the comprehensive, data-filled report you asked for until the data services come back online.

Immediate next steps (your call)
- Retry now: I can automatically retry the data pulls in a minute or two and attempt again in parallel to restore the data feed.
- Retry on schedule: I can attempt again at a specified interval (e.g., every 5–10 minutes) until data is retrieved.
- Alternative data path: If you have a preferred data source or can provide the data files (or a link to a snapshot), I can use those to build the report.
- Narrow the scope: I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative framework now (without the latest data) and fill in the precise numbers as soon as the data tools return.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A comprehensive fundamental report for TSLA, covering:
  - Company profile and business overview
  - Recent fundamentals (latest quarterly income statement highlights)
  - Balance sheet highlights (assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity)
  - Cash flow highlights (operating, investing, financing, free cash flow)
  - Financial history and trend analysis (revenue, margins, profitability, efficiency)
  - Margin analysis (gross, operating, net; trend and drivers)
  - Profitability and efficiency metrics (ROE, ROA, asset turnover, capex intensity)
  - Capital structure and liquidity (debt levels, interest coverage, leverage)
  - Insider sentiment (past 15 days) and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Valuation context (where available) and comparison to peers
  - Risk factors and catalysts relevant to the next quarter
- A consolidated Markdown table at the end organizing key takeaways by section, with fields such as Section, Latest Quarter, Key Metrics, QoQ/YoY Trend, and Notes.

Proposed Markdown table structure (to be filled once data arrives)
- Section | Latest Quarter | Key Metrics | QoQ Trend | Notes
- Company Profile | - | - | - | - 
- Income Statement | Q# 20XX-QX | Revenue, Gross Profit, Operating Income, Net Income, EPS | Up/Down | Drivers
- Balance Sheet | as of 20XX-XX-XX | Total Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Current Ratio | Up/Down | Liquidity snapshot
- Cash Flow | TTM / Latest Quarter | OCF, CapEx, FCF, CFF | Up/Down | Cash-generation signal
- Ratios & Margins | - | Gross Margin, Op Margin, Net Margin, ROE, ROA | Up/Down | Efficiency picture
- Insider Sentiment | Last 15 days | Sentiment score, News/mentions | Up/Down | Potential sentiment shift
- Insider Transactions | Last 15 days | Net buys/sells, notable filers | Net Buy/Sell | Insider signal
- Valuation & Catalysts | - | P/E, EV/EBITDA, Growth estimates | Up/Down | Relative stance
- Risks & Catalysts | - | Key risks, near-term catalysts | - | Trade-off context

Would you like me to:
- Retry now to pull the data, or
- Retry on a schedule (specify interval), or
- Use an alternative data source or provide data manually, or
- Proceed with a qualitative framework for TSLA in the meantime (numbers to be filled in once data comes back)?

If you prefer I retry automatically, I’ll attempt again in the next couple of minutes and then proceed to compile the full report as soon as the data is retrieved.
