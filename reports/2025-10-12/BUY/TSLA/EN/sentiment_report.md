Thanks for the prompt. I hit a tool error trying to fetch TSLA Reddit data for 2025-10-12 (FileNotFoundError from the Reddit data tool). I can’t pull live Reddit sentiment right now. I can proceed in two ways:

- Option A: Retry data fetch when the tool is available, and then deliver a fully data-driven long report with day-by-day sentiment, themes, and a final Markdown table.
- Option B: Deliver a best-effort, qualitative analysis now (without live Reddit data) and clearly label gaps and what would be updated once data comes in.

If you’d like me to proceed now with Option B, here is a comprehensive, structured report scaffold plus a Markdown table at the end. It will clearly note where data is missing due to the current tool issue and what to look for once the Reddit data is retrieved.

Executive summary (status: data gap)
- Current week sentiment for TSLA cannot be precisely quantified without live Reddit data. I will outline the expected analysis framework and the likely themes you’d see once the data is available. In parallel, I highlight key risk factors and catalysts that typically influence TSLA sentiment and price in a week with ongoing product updates, procurement dynamics, and regulatory scrutiny.

What we would measure (data-driven approach)
- Sentiment metrics (per day and rolling window):
  - Average sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral).
  - Distribution of posts (percent positive, negative, neutral).
  - Volume (number of posts) and velocity (rate of new posts).
  - Topic modeling: priority themes (vehicle demand, price changes, production news, Autopilot/FSD progress, earnings, factory news, energy/storage milestones).
  - Event-based spikes aligned to product announcements, quarterly results, or regulatory updates.
- Cross-source corroboration (where possible):
  - Reddit posts (primary source), X/Twitter mentions, StockTwits chatter, Tesla-focused forums.
  - Related news sentiment (news headlines and articles) to contextualize social chatter.
- Price/signal correlation (where data allows):
  - Intraday price moves around sentiment spikes.
  - Volume and volatility changes in relation to sentiment shifts.

What to watch for (themes likely to appear in the week)
- Product and production updates:
  - Updates on new or refreshed models (Model Y/3/S, Cybertruck, Semi).
  - Production ramp progress at Giga factories; any bottlenecks or efficiency gains.
- Pricing and incentives:
  - Price reductions, leasing terms, or regional incentives affecting demand signals.
- Autonomy and software:
  - Progress on FSD beta or regulatory status updates; safety testing commentary.
- Energy division:
  - Battery chemistry news, energy storage deployments, and solar initiatives affecting sentiment beyond vehicle sales.
- Financials and economics:
  - Commentary around margins, cost per vehicle, and supply chain resilience.
- Competition and regulation:
  - Developments involving EV pricing by competitors or regulatory changes impacting EV adoption or autonomous driving.

Key risks and counterpoints (traders’ view)
- Positive catalysts:
  - Strong demand indicators in BEV markets; improved gross margins from mix and price optimization; progress on autonomy milestones.
- Negative catalysts:
  - Regulatory concerns around autonomy; supplier or production bottlenecks; softer demand in key regions; aggressive price cuts compressing margins.
- Sentiment-sensitive risks:
  - Sudden changes in regulatory stance on autonomous tech; unexpected production hiccups; macro sentiment shifts impacting high-beta growth names.

Implications for traders (tentative, data-dependant)
- Short-term: Sentiment-driven volatility around any fresh product or regulatory news; expect spikes in social chatter that precede price moves.
- Medium-term: If sentiment aligns with improving production/margin signals, earnings trajectory could benefit; otherwise, persistent negative themes (e.g., demand concerns, competition) could dampen upside.
- Risk management: Monitor sentiment momentum alongside price action; be wary of overreactions to isolated posts or misinterpreted headlines.

Data gaps and next steps
- Immediate gap: Live Reddit sentiment data for TSLA on 2025-10-12 could not be retrieved due to a tool error.
- Next steps (once the tool is operational):
  - Pull daily Reddit sentiment for TSLA (past 7 days) and compute:
    - Avg daily sentiment score, distribution, and count.
    - Top topics per day and their sentiment polarity.
    - Peak sentiment days and corresponding price moves.
  - Cross-check with X/StockTwits sentiment and key news headlines.
  - Deliver a finalized long-form report with a detailed table and a summarized investment thesis.

Proposed Markdown table (to be filled with data once available)
- The table below is organized to capture key points once the data comes in. Replace “TBD” with actual figures.

| Key Point Category | Key Insight (once data is available) | Sentiment Direction (Prev vs Current) | Primary Data Source | Trading Implication |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Daily sentiment trend | TBD (e.g., improving/declining/no clear trend) | TBD | Reddit daily posts | Use for intraday swing expectations; watch for momentum shifts |
| Top themes by day | TBD (e.g., production updates, autonomy progress) | TBD | Reddit topics, cross-source | Helps gauge what traders are reacting to most; align risk events |
| Volume + volatility signals | TBD | TBD | Post volume, price data | High volume with rising volatility may indicate decisive moves |
| News alignment | TBD | TBD | News headlines, press releases | Validate social sentiment with news context; avoid overreacting to memes or memes-like posts |
| Regime risk indicators | TBD | TBD | Regulatory updates, product recalls | Prepare for potential negative catalysts or regulatory headwinds |
| Overall market context | TBD | TBD | Macro news, sector trend | Tesla is often a sentiment-driven name; factor into position sizing |

Would you like me to proceed with Option A (retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available) or Option B (deliver a complete qualitative analysis now with the data gaps clearly annotated and placeholders for the visuals/table to be filled later)? If you prefer Option A, I can keep you updated and re-run the data pull as soon as the tool is responsive. If you prefer Option B, I can expand the qualitative analysis into a more detailed narrative with deeper trading implications and a richer set of hypothetical examples to guide decisions until the data comes in.
