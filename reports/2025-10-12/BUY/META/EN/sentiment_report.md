I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for META, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool issue). I ran into this error multiple times, so I don’t currently have the Reddit/sentiment data to integrate into the full report.

Here are your options to proceed, and I can start immediately on either path:

Options
- Option 1: Retry data fetch now
  - I’ll retry the get_reddit_stock_info call right away and, if it succeeds, proceed to the full, detailed report with day-by-day sentiment, social threads, and relevant META news from the past week.

- Option 2: Proceed with a best-effort report using available data
  - I’ll draft a comprehensive META analysis based on known drivers, historical sentiment patterns, and publicly available news up to my last reliable data point, clearly marking where live Reddit sentiment would be integrated once the tool works again.

- Option 3: Switch to an alternative data source (if you enable it)
  - If you’d like, I can structure the report and monitor for sentiment from other sources you permit (e.g., Twitter/X, forums, major news outlets) and note that Reddit data is temporarily unavailable.

What I can deliver now (Structure of the long-form report)
- Executive snapshot: META’s current position, near-term catalysts, and potential sentiment catalysts (AI roadmap, ad demand, regulatory environment).
- Social sentiment analysis (pending tool data): day-by-day sentiment trend for META over the past week, identified themes (e.g., ad platform changes, privacy updates, product launches, regulatory concerns).
- News flow contrast: a synthesis of the most impactful META-related headlines over the past week, with potential market impact and tone (positive/negative/neutral).
- Driving variables: ad revenue trends, user engagement signals, AI/VR/metaverse developments, regulatory scrutiny, competition (e.g., X, TikTok, other social platforms), and macro factors.
- Risk and opportunities: finite set of trade-ready theses (e.g., sentiment tailwinds vs. headwinds, potential catalysts for volatility).
- Trading implications: actionable takeaways for traders and investors (short-term catalysts, risk management notes, and scenarios).
- Appendices:
  - Detailed sentiment notes (once data is available).
  - Summary of key news items with timestamps.
  - Makrdown table summarizing the key points, as requested.

Next step
- Please choose Option 1 (retry now) or Option 2 (proceed with best-effort report). If you choose Option 1, I’ll attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately and then deliver the full report with the sentiment section populated. If you choose Option 2, I’ll draft the full report now and clearly flag where Reddit data would be inserted once available.

Note: If you want a quick-start draft now, I can begin with the structure and fill in the non-sentiment sections right away, then overlay Reddit sentiment as soon as the tool is working again. Also, I can provide a Markdown table at the end once you confirm the preferred focus areas for the table (e.g., sentiment themes, headlines, and implications).
