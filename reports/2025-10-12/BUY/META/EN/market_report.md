I attempted to fetch META data and compute the requested indicators, but the data retrieval step failed with a FileNotFoundError from get_YFin_data. I retried a few times and also tried a broader date range, but the environment is currently unable to access the Yahoo Finance CSV needed to generate the indicators. I can retry immediately if you’d like, or proceed once I have a successful data fetch. In the meantime, here is a concrete plan and the indicator set I would use, along with why these are suitable for META given a typical large-cap growth/tech-focused context in late 2025.

What I would do once data is available
- Pull META price history for a multi-month window (e.g., 2024-10-12 to 2025-10-12).
- Compute the selected indicators and generate a detailed, nuanced trend report:
  - Identify the dominant trend direction using moving averages (50SMA and 200SMA) and confirm with the 10EMA for recent momentum shifts.
  - Use MACD and MACD Signal to spot momentum changes and crossovers; interpret MACD Histogram (if available) for momentum strength (even though I’m focusing on MACD and MACD Signal as core signals here).
  - Include RSI to assess overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences relative to price trends.
  - Use VWMA to confirm price action with volume, which helps validate moves in META (a stock with large, likely uneven daily volume spikes).
  - Include Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) to gauge baseline price positioning relative to recent volatility and to help spot potential breakouts or mean-reversion pressures.
- Provide a narrated, fine-grained interpretation:
  - Whether there is alignment across trend, momentum, and volume indicators (e.g., price above 50SMA and 200SMA with MACD bullish crossover, RSI rising but not yet overbought, VWMA confirming price with volume spikes).
  - If conflicts exist (e.g., price above 50SMA but RSI overbought or MACD turning down), explain potential scenarios and risk-managed entries/exits.
  - Practical trading implications: potential entry zones, risk controls (using ATR for dynamic stops if you want), and suggested watchpoints for reversals or breakouts.
- Deliver a final Markdown table summarizing the key takeaways and the role of each indicator in the current context.

Proposed 8 indicators for META (complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction, dynamic support/resistance, helps filter noisy signals when used with faster indicators.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark, helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death cross conceptually).
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures short-term momentum shifts; useful for quicker entries when confirmed by longer-term trends.
- macd: MACD line. Core momentum signal; signals trend changes via crossovers with MACD Signal.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoothing of the MACD line; crossovers with MACD generate trade signals and reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum gauge with typical overbought/oversold thresholds; watch for divergences against price trends for potential reversals.
- vwma: VWMA. Volume-weighted trend confirmation; helps validate moves that price-based indicators alone might misread, especially in a stock with heavy daily volume like META.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA). Baseline for price relative to volatility; useful to spot mean-reversion expectations or breakout zones when used with bands in a broader analysis.

Note on data and results
- If you’d like, I can retry immediately to fetch the data (get_YFin_data) and compute the indicators in the exact configuration above. If the environment continues to fail, I can adapt by using alternative data inputs or a reduced set of indicators. Please tell me if you want me to retry now or wait for you to provide access to the data source.

Proposed short-form plan (before data is available)
- Confirm data fetch succeeds.
- Return a detailed, nuanced META trend report with:
  - Individual indicator interpretations
  - Cross-indicator consensus and conflict points
  - Contextual notes about market regime (growth/tech sector, macro risk, earnings cycle)
  - Actionable insights (entry/exit ideas, risk controls)
- Append a Markdown table at the end with the 8 indicators, category, and the purpose/interpretation notes for quick reference.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with the current plan and wait for the data to come through? If you want me to retry, I’ll attempt again immediately and then deliver the full, data-backed report. In the meantime, here’s a ready-to-use reference table you can copy for planning purposes. (It mirrors the 8 indicators listed above.)

Markdown table (indicator plan)
| Indicator | Category | Purpose / What to look for |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; filter signals with faster indicators |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark; identify major regime shifts |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts; quicker entry/exit signals when aligned with longer MA trends |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum signal; trend-change indications via MACD line crossovers |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal; confirm crossovers and filter false positives |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold zones and divergences |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Volume-confirmed trend; validate price moves with volume context |
| boll | Volatility Indicators (Bollinger Middle) | Baseline against volatility; identify mean-reversion vs breakout tendencies |

I’ll wait for your guidance on retrying the data fetch. If you want me to proceed differently (e.g., adjust date range, use a subset of indicators, or switch to an alternative data source), tell me and I’ll adjust accordingly.
