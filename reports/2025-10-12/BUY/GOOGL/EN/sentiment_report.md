I tried to fetch the Reddit stock news for GOOGL on 2025-10-12, but I’m hitting an internal tool error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data pull right away if you’d like, or we can proceed with a plan to produce the long-form report using alternative sources or once the Reddit feed is accessible again.

Options to proceed:
- Option A: Retry now to fetch Reddit data for GOOGL (GOOGL) on 2025-10-12 and then generate the full report with day-by-day sentiment, latest headlines, and key implications for traders.
- Option B: Proceed with a thorough analysis using other available data sources (e.g., major news headlines, general social sentiment on X/Reddit outside the specific Reddit feed, legacy patterns) and clearly note the data gaps until the Reddit feed is restored.
- Option C: You provide the Reddit data or allow me to work from a snapshot you provide, and I’ll build the report around that.

What I will deliver once we have data (or you confirm proceeding with other sources):
- A comprehensive long-form report analyzing GOOGL (Alphabet) from a trader’s perspective, focusing on:
  - Sentiment analysis: day-by-day sentiment trends over the past week, notable sentiment spikes tied to specific events, and an assessment of bullish vs bearish tone.
  - Social chatter themes: recurring topics (AI initiatives, ad revenue, YouTube, Cloud, regulatory risk, product launches) and how they shift over the week.
  - News roundup: summary of the most impactful headlines in the past week (earnings context if any, regulatory updates, AI/tech developments, partnerships, antitrust considerations), with quick implications for sentiment and price action.
  - Price-action correlation: any observed lead-lag relationships between sentiment signals and stock moves (volatility, intraday swings, gap dynamics).
  - Risk factors and catalysts: top near-term risks (regulatory, competitive, macro sentiment) and potential catalysts (new products, earnings surprises, policy changes).
  - Trader-oriented takeaways: actionable ideas like short-term hedges, alpha signals, or caution flags, with caveats.
- A Makrdown table at the end organizing key points, signals, and implications for quick reference.

If you’d like me to proceed now with retrying the Reddit data fetch, please say “Retry now.” Otherwise, tell me which option you prefer (A, B, or C), and I’ll start building the report accordingly.
