I attempted to fetch the data and generate the indicators for GOOGL, but the data retrieval step failed due to a system/file error (FileNotFoundError). Here are the current status and next steps, plus a concrete plan for when data is available.

What happened
- Parallel data fetch and indicator requests were attempted, but the underlying data source could not be found (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory).
- Individual fetch via get_YFin_data also returned the same error.

Immediate next steps
- I can retry the data retrieval now, or you can specify a lighter date window (e.g., 6–12 months) to improve the chance of success.
- If the failure persists, I can switch to a backup data source if you authorize, or proceed with a qualitative, non-numeric plan based on typical behavior for GOOGL while we wait for data access to restore.
- Once data is retrieved successfully, I will compute the selected indicators and deliver a detailed, nuanced report with signals, confirmations, and caveats.

Selected indicators (up to 8, chosen for diverse, complementary insights)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale for these choices
- Trend direction and confirmation: close_50_sma and close_200_sma help identify medium- and long-term trend direction and potential support/resistance zones.
- Momentum and cross-confirmation: macd, macds, and macdh provide momentum signals along with signal-line crossovers and histogram strength to confirm entries/exits.
- Short-term momentum context: rsi gives a quick read on overbought/oversold conditions, helpful for timing when used with trend indicators.
- Volatility and risk management: boll (middle band) gives a volatility benchmark and can help spot breakouts or reversals relative to a dynamic baseline; atr informs stop placement and position sizing by capturing current volatility.
- Combined view: Together, these indicators cover trend (2 SMAs), momentum (MACD trio + RSI), volatility (boll, ATR), giving a well-rounded picture without overlapping too much.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report describing the current setup for GOOGL, including:
  - Trend alignment across the 50SMA and 200SMA
  - MACD-based momentum signals and histogram strength
  - RSI readings with potential divergences or extremes
  - Bollinger context for potential breakouts or pullbacks
  - ATR-based volatility context for risk management and stop placement
- Fine-grained insights, such as:
  - If price is respecting or breaking dynamic support/resistance implied by the 50SMA or 200SMA
  - Whether MACD crossovers align with RSI and Bollinger signals
  - Potential scenarios (e.g., trend continuation vs. fatigue vs. reversal) with caveats
- A concise, actionable plan with potential entry/exit considerations and risk controls tailored to the current pattern

Draft table of key indicators (to be filled with live data when available)

- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  - How to use: Confirm with faster indicators for timely entries; watch for price crossing above/below as a trend signal
  - Caveats: Lags price; in choppy markets signals can be noisy

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark
  - How to use: Assess overall market regime (bullish/bearish) and potential golden/death cross setups
  - Caveats: Slow to react; best for strategic positioning rather than frequent trades

- Indicator: macd
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossovers with the signal line; confirm with other indicators
  - Caveats: Can give false positives in low-volatility or sideways markets

- Indicator: macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal (EMA of MACD)
  - How to use: Use crossovers with the MACD line to trigger signals
  - Caveats: Should be used as part of a broader filter to avoid false signals

- Indicator: macdh
  - What it measures: Momentum strength via MACD histogram
  - How to use: Monitor histogram expansion/contraction for momentum strength; watch for divergences
  - Caveats: Can be volatile; pair with trend and volume confirmation

- Indicator: rsi
  - What it measures: Momentum; overbought/oversold conditions
  - How to use: Look for cross-checks with trend and MACD; divergence signals add nuance
  - Caveats: In strong trends, RSI can stay extreme for extended periods

- Indicator: boll
  - What it measures: Bollinger Middle (20-SMA baseline) as a volatility-adjusted baseline
  - How to use: Assess breakout/reversal potential relative to the middle line; confirm with upper/lower bands
  - Caveats: Prices can ride the band in strong trends; needs corroboration

- Indicator: atr
  - What it measures: True range-based volatility
  - How to use: Inform stop placement and position sizing; adapt risk to current volatility
  - Caveats: Reactive measure; do not rely on it alone for entry signals

Next steps for you
- Please confirm if you’d like me to retry data retrieval now (I’ll rerun get_YFin_data for GOOGL with the same date window and then compute the 8 indicators).
- If you prefer, I can try a shorter window (e.g., last 180 days) to increase the chance of a successful run.
- Alternatively, you can authorize a backup data source or a simplified analysis until the primary data path is restored.

Note: Current date context is 2025-10-12. Once data access is restored, I’ll deliver the full, detailed analysis with the 8 indicators and the table of key points as described above.
