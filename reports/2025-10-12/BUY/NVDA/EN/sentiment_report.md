I ran into a tool issue pulling Reddit sentiment data for NVDA. The get_reddit_stock_info calls returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the day-by-day Reddit sentiment to include yet. I can retry once the tool is available again, or switch to a fallback data workflow if you’d like. Here are the options and how I can proceed:

What happened
- Attempted to fetch NVDA Reddit sentiment data for 2025-10-06 through 2025-10-12, but the Reddit data retrieval tool failed with a FileNotFoundError.
- I don’t have a current Reddit sentiment dataset to embed in the report right now.

What you can do next
- Retry the Reddit data pull now or after a short delay to see if the tool comes back online.
- Proceed with a high-quality alternative immediately (e.g., aggregate sentiment from other social sources or provide a qualitative, data-backed framework for the past week) while we wait for Reddit data to come back.
- Narrow the date window or switch to a different ticker for a quick sanity-check if you want to test the workflow.

What I can deliver now (even without the Reddit data)
- A comprehensive, trader-focused NVDA report structure that you can fill in with the Reddit data once it’s available.
- A robust framework for sentiment analysis, news, and implications for trading decisions, including a daily snapshot template and key risk factors.
- A Markdown table template at the end to organize the key takeaways for quick reference.

Proposed report structure (NVDA, past week)
1) Executive snapshot
- Summary of sentiment and news flow over the past 7 days.
- Core drivers: AI demand signals, product cadence updates, regulatory or macro headwinds.
- Immediate implications for traders: sentiment strength, momentum vs. risk.

2) Daily sentiment and engagement overview (to be populated by Reddit data)
- Date
- Sentiment polarity (positive/neutral/negative)
- Key sentiment themes (e.g., AI chip demand, supply constraints, pricing, guidance)
- Engagement signals (volume, upvotes, comments)
- Top 3 representative posts (brief paraphrase)

3) News and catalysts (past 7 days)
- Major earnings/guide updates (if any)
- Product/news cycle (new chips, architectures, data center deployments)
- Regulatory or geopolitical developments affecting Nvidia (export controls, supply chain, antitrust context)
- Market reaction (intraday move vs. sentiment shift)

4) Thematic sentiment analysis (insights for traders)
- AI demand narrative: sustainability, sustainability risk, or signs of deceleration
- Competitive landscape signals (competitors, accelerators, or anti-dilutive innovations)
- Financial narrative: margins, capex cadence, AI compute demand
- Risk flags: macro shock, supply chain, regulatory changes

5) Price-action context and risk management
- Alignment between sentiment/news and price moves (e.g., positive sentiment with lifting price, or divergence)
- Key levels to watch (intraday resistance/support, moving averages)
- Positioning considerations (options skew, implied volatility context if available)

6) Conclusions and trade considerations
- Trading stance aligned with the current sentiment and news mix (short-term catalysts, medium-term risk)
- Scenarios: bullish, base, bearish with respective triggers
- Recommended risk controls and exit rules

Appendix (data notes)
- Data sources used (Reddit, news outlets, macro data)
- Data limitations and caveats
- Next steps for data refresh

Markdown table template (to append at the end)
- A compact summary you can read at a glance

Next steps
- Tell me how you’d like to proceed:
  - Option A: I retry the Reddit data pull now and then generate the full long-form report with the day-by-day Reddit sentiment included.
  - Option B: I proceed with the full long-form report using only available news and a qualitative sentiment analysis, leaving placeholders for Reddit data to be filled in once available.
  - Option C: You provide an alternative data source (e.g., a different social platform or a preferred sentiment dataset), and I’ll incorporate it into the report.

If you want me to proceed with Option A or B, just say the word and I’ll start populating the report framework accordingly and fill in the Markdown table once we have sentiment data.
