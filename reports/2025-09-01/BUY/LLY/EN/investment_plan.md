# Investment Plan

Here’s how I see it. The bull and bear cases both have merit, but when you weigh the evidence, Eli Lilly looks like a buy for a patient, risk-aware investor.

1) Key Points from the Bull Side  
• Pipeline Power—Orforglipron’s Phase-3 success in obesity treatment is a genuine game-changer. If approved and adopted at scale, it could meaningfully boost revenues over the next 3–5 years.  
• Financial Strength—Solid cash flow (about $5.60 per share), manageable balance sheet and an R&D engine that’s delivering new candidates. Investors are willing to pay a premium (P/E ~35) because they see growth ahead.  
• Market Tailwinds—Global obesity treatment demand is only rising. Plus, potential Fed rate cuts should improve risk appetite for growth names like LLY.  

2) Key Points from the Bear Side  
• Valuation & Technicals—You’re paying a lot up front (P/E in the mid-30s, P/S near 8), and the stock is under its 50- and 200-day moving averages with a negative MACD signal. That signals near-term pain if overall market sentiment sours.  
• Competition & Execution Risk—Novo Nordisk and others are formidable opponents in obesity. Lilly still has to prove it can convert that Phase-3 win into real dollars in a crowded market.  
• Volatility—Recent swings highlight that you could see double-digit moves to the downside before the next leg up.  

My Recommendation: BUY, but with a disciplined, risk-managed approach.  
Why Buy Despite the Risks?  
• The core thesis is fundamentally intact: breakthrough obesity drugs command premium pricing and long patent life. Orforglipron is on track to be a blockbuster if it gains approval and scale.  
• While valuation is rich, history shows that successful Phase-3 biopharma stories can justify high multiples—especially when backed by strong cash flows and a diversified product line.  
• Technicals are weak now, which simply gives us a tactical entry opportunity rather than a reason to walk away.  

Action Plan for the Trader  
1. Position Sizing & Entry  
   – Allocate no more than 5–7% of total equity to LLY to keep any one stock from dominating your risk.  
   – Dollar-cost average your buy over 4–6 weeks, using 3–4 equal tranches. Focus especially on any pullbacks toward the $700–720 area, which is near its 200-day SMA.  

2. Risk Controls  
   – Set a mental stop-loss or alert close to 10% below your average cost. That way, if volatility turns ugly or clinical setbacks emerge, you can exit before losses compound.  
   – If you’re uncomfortable with a hard stop, you can instead pre-decide to trim half your position if LLY falls below $680 on rising volume.  

3. News & Data Monitoring  
   – Track FDA timelines on orforglipron closely; any delay or adverse data point could trigger a swift move down.  
   – Watch broader market sentiment, especially Fed announcements, since rate surprises will impact high-growth pharma.  

4. Reassessment Points  
   – At 3, 6, and 12 months after your initial entry, review actual sales data once orforglipron launches. If uptake is slower than analysts expect, be ready to scale back.  
   – If new clinical data on subsequent drugs in Lilly’s pipeline take the stock meaningfully higher (say +20% from your entry), consider locking in partial gains.  

Learning from Past Mistakes  
I’ve burned capital before by chasing growth stories without a plan for volatility or competitive setbacks. This time, I’m combining conviction in Lilly’s breakthrough pipeline with strict risk limits and staggered entries. That balance between optimism and caution is how I’m improving my decision-making.  

In short, I’m buying Eli Lilly here because the upside from obesity-drug leadership is too big to ignore—but I’m doing it with a well-defined playbook to contain drawdowns and stay adaptable as real data arrives.
