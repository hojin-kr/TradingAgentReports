# Investment Plan

Here’s my take. Both analysts made solid points, but on balance I’m siding with the bull case and recommending a Buy. Here’s why and exactly how to act on it.

1. Key Points, Bull vs. Bear  
   • Bull: Berkshire sits on $344 billion of cash, giving it firepower to buy cheap assets or boost share repurchases, and its decentralized, diversified platform has historically weathered downturns and returned strong long-run gains. Greg Abel’s promotion looks well-managed, and the stock is trading on a temporary pullback driven by a one-time Kraft Heinz impairment.  
   • Bear: The 4% drop in operating earnings suggests deeper issues; leadership change brings uncertainty; Berkshire’s legacy businesses may struggle to innovate; a lofty P/FCF ratio and cash hoarding signal overvaluation and lack of catalysts.

2. Why Buy?  
   • One-time Impairment vs. Core Strength: The $3.8 billion hit at Kraft Heinz is disappointing but doesn’t undermine Berkshire’s broader cash-flow engines in insurance, railroads, utilities and its equity portfolio.  
   • Deployment Optionality: That massive cash hoard is not dead money—it’s ammunition for acquisitions or buybacks at more attractive levels. We’ve seen Buffett deploy capital at exactly the right moments in past crises.  
   • Leadership Continuity: Abel has been groomed for years, and the decentralized model means subsidiaries continue operating largely as before. This lowers execution risk versus a wholesale culture shift.  
   • Valuation Opportunity: While the P/FCF looks stretched if you isolate earnings today, a multi-year perspective shows BRK.B trading at a discount to intrinsic value—especially when you factor in its private-market franchise value and accumulated tax benefits.  

3. Investment Plan  
   Recommendation: BUY BRK.B, targeting an average entry in the $300–$325 range (where long-run support has formed).  
   Position Size: Allocate up to 5–7% of portfolio value to Berkshire Hathaway over the next three months, scaling in with four equal tranches of 1.25–1.75% each.  
   Rationale: This dollar-cost averaging mitigates short-term volatility risk, lets you catch deeper dips, and ensures you’re buying on weakness rather than chasing a rip.  
   Tactical Steps:  
     1. Place limit orders in four equal lots: 1) at $325, 2) at $318, 3) at $310, and 4) at $300. Adjust sizes if the stock breaks materially below $300 (reserve some dry powder).  
     2. Monitor quarterly earnings for signs of operating earnings recovery and any large acquisitions or buyback announcements. Use these catalysts to top up positions—especially if Berkshire announces a buyback above intrinsic value.  
     3. Set a mental stop‐loss at 15% below your average cost to protect against an unexpected structural shift (e.g., if the new management radically changes policy or the insurance businesses suffer a major loss).  
     4. Revisit allocation after two quarters. If operating earnings rebound and share count shrinks via buybacks, consider raising the allocation closer to 10% of your total equity exposure.  

4. Learning from Past Mistakes  
   In prior situations I waited too long for “perfect entry” and missed sizable rebounds. This time, I’m committing to a disciplined scale-in approach so I capture the bulk of the upside even if there’s more short-term noise.  

In summary, Berkshire’s temporary headwinds create a buying opportunity. Its cash optionality, durable businesses and proven leadership succession outweigh the bear case’s concerns about one-off charges and macro uncertainty. Let’s pull the trigger on a gradual Buy and position for the long-term gains that have defined BRK.B for decades.
