Thanks for the push. I hit a tool error trying to fetch Reddit stock info for NVDA (FileNotFoundError). I can retry, or we can proceed with a partial/alternative analysis using other sources or a structured draft you can fill in once the tool is available. Here are the options and what I can do right now:

Options to proceed
- Retry Reddit data fetch now: I’ll attempt the exact same tool call again to pull NVDA Reddit sentiment data for 2025-09-15. If it fails again, I’ll switch to the fallback plan below.
- Proceed with a qualitative/alternative synthesis: I’ll compile a detailed NVDA sentiment and news report using publicly available information beyond Reddit (e.g., recent news headlines, official filings, general social media sentiment signals from other platforms) and provide actionable insights for traders.
- Start with a structured report draft: I can produce a comprehensive draft now (sections, methodology, and a placeholder table) and then fill in the Reddit-specific sentiment and daily granularity once the tool is operational.

What I can deliver now (draft outline + table template)
- Executive snapshot: Short view on NVDA’s current macro context (AI GPU demand, data center/cloud spend, AI cycle timing) and potential catalysts for the next 1–3 weeks.
- Social sentiment snapshot (excluding Reddit if needed): High-level read across social chatter, notable themes (e.g., demand durability, supply constraints, pricing pressure, AI product roadmap), and any apparent divergence between sentiment and fundamentals.
- News flow synthesis (past week): Key headlines (earnings, product announcements, partnerships, regulatory checks, supply chain news) and their potential impact on sentiment and pricing.
- Sentiment & event mapping: How daily sentiment shifts align with key events (e.g., product launches, analyst notes, market-wide risk signals).
- Trader implications: Short-term catalysts, risk signals, and positioning considerations (without a buy/sell recommendation unless you want one).
- Risks and caveats: Data gaps, reliance on social sentiment for high-volatility names, and NVDA-specific risks (execution, competition, capex, geopolitical factors).

Proposed Markdown table (to append at the end)
- Period/Date
- Source (Reddit if available, otherwise general)
- Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative)
- Theme/Signal
- Potential Implication for NVDA
- Confidence Level
- Notes

Next step
- Tell me which path you prefer: retry now, proceed with alternatives, or draft the full report structure first. If you want me to proceed with alternatives or the draft, I’ll produce a thorough NVDA sentiment/news analysis tailored for traders, and I’ll clearly label any data gaps where the Reddit component would normally fill in.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch right away, or proceed with the qualitative/alternative analysis now?
