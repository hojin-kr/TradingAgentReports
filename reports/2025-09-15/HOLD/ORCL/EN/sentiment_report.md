I hit a tool error trying to fetch Reddit stock info for ORCL. Details:

- Parallel tool call returned: FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory (multiple dates).
- A subsequent single-call attempt for 2025-09-15 also returned the same FileNotFoundError.

What this means: I can’t pull the Reddit-based sentiment data right now due to a tool/environment issue. I can’t proceed with the Reddit/ social-media sentiment portion until the tool is working again.

Options to move forward (you pick which you prefer):
1) Retry Reddit data retrieval now
   - I’ll attempt another round of the Reddit data pulls (sequentially or in parallel if the tool supports it) and then resume the full ORCL social sentiment + news analysis once the data comes in.
2) Use an alternative data source set for sentiment
   - Provide or allow me to pull sentiment from other sources (e.g., StockTwits, Twitter/X, public investor forums, ORCL earnings call transcripts, major news sentiment). I’ll compile a parallel long-form report with day-by-day sentiment, themes, and implications for traders.
3) Wait and proceed with a best-effort framework
   - I can draft a comprehensive ORCL report structure (what I would look for, metrics, and expected insights) once data is available, plus a ready-to-fill markdown table of key points. Then I can plug in the actual sentiment/narratives as soon as the Reddit tool is back.

If you’d like me to proceed now with option 1 (retry), I’ll initiate another attempt to fetch Reddit data for ORCL covering 2025-09-09 through 2025-09-15 and then continue with a full report including:
- Daily sentiment trajectory and volatility
- Top themes and representative posts
- Correlation with Oracle-related news (product/partner announcements, cloud growth, AI initiatives, financial results)
- Price/volume context and potential trading implications
- Risk factors and notable sentiment shifts (e.g., pivots after earnings, regulatory news, or big partnerships)

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want option 2, specify the sources you want me to prioritize (e.g., StockTwits, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, gaming/news outlets), and I’ll adapt the report accordingly.
