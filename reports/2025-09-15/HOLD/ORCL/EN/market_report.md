I tried to fetch ORCL data for 2024-09-15 to 2025-09-15, but the data retrieval tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). This seems to be an issue with the data source rather than with Oracle itself. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

Options
- Retry now with the same date range, in case the issue is transient.
- Retry with a shorter window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to confirm data availability.
- If you’re okay with it, I can proceed using the selected indicator framework and prepare a detailed plan and interpretation guide for ORCL that will be ready to run as soon as data is retrieved.

Proposed indicator set (up to 8 indicators) for ORCL
Rationale: This mix provides a balanced view of trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context. They are complementary and avoid redundancy.

- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average to identify the medium-term trend and potential dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average to confirm long-term trend and watch for golden/death cross signals.
- close_10_ema: 10-period EMA to capture short-term momentum shifts and potential quicker entry/exit signals.
- macd: MACD line to spot momentum changes and potential trend reversals via crossovers and divergence.
- macds: MACD Signal line to trigger trades with MACD crossovers; adds a smoothing/confirmation layer.
- macdh: MACD Histogram to visualize momentum strength and divergences; useful for early signals in conjunction with MACD lines.
- rsi: RSI to monitor overbought/oversold conditions and divergences; helps identify momentum-driven reversals when used with trend context.
- atr: ATR to gauge volatility and inform risk management (position sizing and stop placement) in the current regime.

Notes on how I’ll use these indicators together (when data is available)
- Trend confirmation: 50_SMA and 200_SMA provide a clear view of medium-to-long-term trends; use crossovers and price relation to these lines to assess regime changes.
- Momentum: 10_EMA with MACD family (macd, macds, macdh) gives both crossovers and strength signals, helping distinguish true breaks from noise.
- Overbought/oversold context: RSI adds momentum context, especially when price is above/below the major moving averages.
- Volatility/risk management: ATR informs stop placement and position sizing in line with current price volatility.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, either with:
- the same 2024-09-15 to 2025-09-15 window, or
- a shorter window (e.g., 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-15) to quickly validate data availability?

As soon as the data retrieval succeeds, I will compute the indicators and deliver:
- a detailed, nuanced report on the trends and what the readings imply for trading ORCL,
- a Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points and the selected indicators. 

Proposed Markdown table (planning stage)
| Indicator | Role for ORCL analysis | What to watch for (signals/interpretation) |
|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend indicator | Price above/below 50SMA; pullbacks to 50SMA as support/resistance |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above/below 200SMA; potential golden/death cross signals with shorter MA |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10EMA; quick momentum shifts |
| macd | Momentum trend change | MACD line cross with signal; potential bullish/bearish cross signals |
| macds | MACD signal confirmation | MACD vs signal cross confirmations to reduce false positives |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction; divergence from price action |
| rsi | Overbought/oversold context | RSI >70 or <30; look for divergences with price trend |
| atr | Volatility and risk sizing | Rising ATR indicates higher volatility; adjust stops/position size accordingly |

If you’d like me to proceed with retrying now, tell me whether to use the same window or switch to a shorter window, and I’ll run the fetch and then generate the full, detailed report once data is available.
