# Investment Report: NFLX
## Executive Summary
Netflix is a streaming service aiming to grow ad revenue and international revenue. Near-term milestones must prove progress; a HOLD preserves upside while avoiding paying for uncertain near-term progress.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Ad revenue and international ARPU are the main levers for upside; progress here could lift the stock if milestones are met.
- Near-term risks, including leadership changes and ad-market cycles, could delay progress and delay a re-rating.
- The plan depends on milestone progress, not just subscriber gains; concrete data is needed to confirm momentum.
- The long-run case remains intact, but near-term catalysts are uncertain; holding avoids overpaying while preserving upside if milestones prove out.

## Risks To Watch
- Ad-revenue ramp slower than expected.
- International ARPU growth stalls or disappoints.
- Leadership cadence or roadmap delays that slow monetization or rollout.
- Macro ad-market softness and a high starting valuation that leaves room for downside if milestones miss.
