Recommendation: Hold NFLX.

Rationale (concise):
- The provided plan rightly weights near-term risks (international growth deceleration, leadership turnover, ad-market cyclicality, rich valuation) against a longer-term growth thesis (ad monetization, international ARPU upside, durable moats).
- Given the balance of risks and potential catalysts, a cautious stance keeps upside optional while avoiding premature conviction on a buy.
- Until tangible milestones materialize (and a clean technical setup confirms), the risk-reward favors waiting rather than deploying more capital.

Actions and guardrails:
- If you already own NFLX: maintain exposure but implement risk controls. Consider hedges (protective puts or a collar) to guard against downside in a volatile macro environment.
- If you’re not currently long: avoid initiating new longs until clear, multi-quarter data confirms acceleration in ad-revenue and international ARPU, plus a technical breakout.
- Upgrade to Buy only on clear validation:
  - Ad revenue accelerates beats consensus for two consecutive quarters (strong YoY ad RPM growth).
  - Sustained improvement in international ARPU across two quarters.
  - On-time or earlier-than-guided product/ad milestones with observable monetization impact.
  - Positive technical breakout (price above key resistance with MACD confirming and longer-term moving averages turning constructive).
- Downgrade/Sell triggers:
  - Ad-revenue milestones miss for two consecutive quarters.
  - Leadership/roadmap delays that clearly impair near-term monetization or international rollout.
  - Technical breakdown (price below 50-day/200-day, negative MACD/RSi deterioration) or worsening ARPU/margin dynamics.
- Risk management:
  - Limit single-name exposure (e.g., 2–3% of the portfolio portion dedicated to NFLX, adjusted for total risk budget).
  - Use ATR-based stops and/or a hedged approach (puts or collar) to protect suboptimal outcomes while preserving upside.

Catalyst cadence:
- Reassess around NFLX earnings and major ad-milestones with a rolling 3–6 month horizon. Trigger-driven decisions should align with concrete milestones rather than headlines.

Final verdict:
- Hold remains the prudent stance today. Upgrade only on robust, multi-signal confirmation of the ad-revenue ramp and international monetization milestones, with a favorable technical backdrop. Otherwise, stay patient and prepared to reassess.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
