You're right to ask for more. I tried to pull the latest Reddit stock news for NFLX, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal issue with the data source). It isn’t your input—it's an environment problem on my end.

What I can do now
- Retry the data pull as soon as the tool is available again.
- Or switch to a thorough qualitative framework right away, and then plug in the actual Reddit/news sentiment data as soon as the tool comes back online.

Two options for you
1) Retry now (preferred if you want the actual Reddit sentiment data included in the report)
   - I’ll reattempt the Reddit/news extraction for NFLX for the current date (2025-09-15) and generate a comprehensive weekly sentiment and news report with:
     - Daily sentiment trend (positive/neutral/negative) for the past 7 days
     - Top themes discussed on Reddit and other social channels
     - Key company news events in the past week and their sentiment impact
     - Discussion of implications for traders (stock drivers, risk signals, opportunity sets)
     - A concise, actionable summary for traders
     - A Markdown table at the end organizing key points
   - If the tool still fails, I’ll immediately switch to a robust qualitative analysis using public information and clearly label it as sentiment/driver-based guidance without raw data pulls.

2) Do a framework-based analysis now (no tool needed)
   - I’ll deliver a full, detailed framework with:
     - Methodology for sentiment scoring and data sources
     - What metrics to watch (delta vs. 7-day MA, day-level spikes, topic clustering)
     - Likely sentiment/price drivers for NFLX in the past week (content slate, subscriber trends, price changes, competition, macro factors)
     - Trader implications and risk overlays
     - A sample Markdown table structure you can fill in later with real data
   - Then I’ll run the data pull as soon as the tool is operational and append the actual figures and table.

Which path would you prefer? If you want the fastest path to a results-ready report, I recommend option 1 (retry now). If you’d rather proceed immediately with a solid framework and then drop in the live data once available, go with option 2.
