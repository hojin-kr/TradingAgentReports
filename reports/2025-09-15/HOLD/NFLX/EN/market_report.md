I attempted to fetch NFLX data and compute the requested indicators, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data pull (either with a shorter date range or after a short wait) or proceed with a robust indicator framework and explain how to interpret it once data is available. Below is a detailed, ready-to-use indicator framework tailored for NFLX, plus a concise interpretation guide and a summary table.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators) for NFLX
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm trend context alongside longer-term signals.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming major trend direction and spotting golden/death-cross contexts when used with crossovers.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  Why: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price. Complements the slower 50/200 SMAs to filter signals.
- macd (MACD)
  Why: Core momentum indicator showing differences between two EMAs; crossovers signal potential trend changes.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with the MACD line provide clearer entry/exit cues and help reduce noise.
- rsi (Momentum)
  Why: Measures overbought/oversold conditions and divergence risk. Useful for spotting potential reversals, especially after extended moves.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  Why: 20-period SMA baseline for Bollinger Bands; indicates volatility context and potential breakout/reversal zones when combined with bands.
- atr (Volatility)
  Why: True range-based volatility measure; aids in position sizing and setting appropriate stop levels given current volatility.

Rationale and how to interpret these for NFLX
- Trend context (50 SMA, 200 SMA): NFLX often exhibits extended trends tied to subscriber growth, earnings, and policy shifts. Use 50 vs 200 to gauge whether the stock is in a broader uptrend, downtrend, or range. Expect long-term trend confirmation to filter shorter-term trades.
- Short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD family, RSI): The 10 EMA captures near-term shifts; MACD and MACD Signal help validate momentum strength and potential crossovers. RSI provides a momentum bias check but should be interpreted within the trend context (RSI can stay overbought in strong uptrends).
- Volatility and breakout potential (Boll middle, ATR): Bollinger middle gives a dynamic baseline; when price approaches or breaks the bands, corroborate with ATR to assess whether the move has enough volatility to sustain.
- Confirmation and risk controls: Using MACD and its signal line together reduces false positives. RSI offers a divergence check for potential reversals, while ATR guides risk management in position sizing and stop placement.

What to watch for (signals and actionable interpretations)
- If price stays above 50 SMA and 200 SMA and 10 EMA is rising: bullish context; look for MACD line crossing above MACD Signal as a bullish entry cue; RSI staying above 50 supports upside momentum.
- If MACD crosses below MACD Signal while price is near or below the 50/200 SMA: potential trend weakening; consider waiting for a higher time-frame confirmation or a bullish reversal signal (e.g., RSI bounce with price above 50 SMA).
- If price touches or breaches Boll middle and walks toward the upper Boll Band with rising ATR: looks like a breakout phase; ensure ATR is confirming increased volatility to avoid false breakouts.
- If RSI hits overbought (above ~70) in an uptrend but price remains above major moving averages: signals caution for a short-term pullback; look for MACD/RSI divergence or a price pullback toward the 50 SMA for a potential entry with risk controls.
- If ATR increases while price bands tighten (consolidation): a potential setup for a breakout; wait for a breakout beyond Boll upper/lower with MACD confirming momentum.

Limitations and next steps
- Dependent on data availability: The actual indicator values and signals require fresh data. I encountered a data retrieval error; once data is accessible, I will compute the indicators and provide a precise, timestamped signal snapshot.
- Avoid overfitting to a single indicator: Use the combination above to confirm signals. If you’d like, I can also run a complementary check with VWMA or a secondary volatility measure (e.g., Bollinger band width) as a fallback.
- Risk management: Given NFLX’s typical volatility, pair these signals with ATR-based stop loss and risk-per-trade controls to avoid outsized losses on news-driven moves.

Proposed next steps
- Retry data pull for NFLX to compute the 8 indicators above with the actual values. I can retry with a shorter date range (e.g., last 1–2 years) if that helps speed up retrieval.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a hypothetical example using representative values to illustrate how signals would play out, then replace with real numbers once data is available.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation

- Indicator: close_50_sma
  Category: Moving Averages
  What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  Interpretation for NFLX: Price above 50 SMA and rising suggests bullish bias; cross below may indicate trend weakening or consolidation.

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  Category: Moving Averages
  What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark
  Interpretation for NFLX: Price above 200 SMA supports bullish long-term trend; sustained break below could indicate a major shift or risk of trend reversal.

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  Category: Moving Averages
  What it measures: Short-term momentum
  Interpretation for NFLX: Rising 10 EMA signals near-term upside; turning down can precede price retracements or trend changes.

- Indicator: macd
  Category: MACD Related
  What it measures: Momentum via EMA differences
  Interpretation for NFLX: MACD line crossing above MACD Signal is a bullish signal; crossing below is bearish—use with trend context.

- Indicator: macds
  Category: MACD Related
  What it measures: MACD Signal line (EMA smoothing)
  Interpretation for NFLX: MACD Signal crossing the MACD line reinforces the potential signal; a delay exists relative to the MACD line itself.

- Indicator: rsi
  Category: Momentum
  What it measures: Relative strength momentum
  Interpretation for NFLX: RSI > 70 suggests overbought risk in a strong uptrend; RSI < 30 suggests oversold risk; watch for divergences with price.

- Indicator: boll
  Category: Volatility
  What it measures: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA baseline)
  Interpretation for NFLX: Price moving toward/away from the Boll middle indicates volatility regime and potential breakout/reversal when combined with bands.

- Indicator: atr
  Category: Volatility
  What it measures: Average true range (volatility)
  Interpretation for NFLX: Higher ATR implies larger price swings and potentially wider stops; lower ATR suggests quieter periods.

If you’d like, I can attempt the data fetch again now and then generate the actual indicator table with real values. Please tell me if you want me to retry immediately, adjust the date range, or proceed with the hypothetical framework above.
