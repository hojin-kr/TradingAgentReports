I tried to fetch the requested data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financials) for TSLA, but the tool layer returned a FileNotFoundError for all calls. I can retry immediately or on a schedule, but right now I don’t have the data to produce the full, data-driven report you asked for. Here’s how I can proceed and what I can provide in the meantime.

What I can provide now
- A detailed framework for TSLA’s fundamentals tailored for traders, with explicit data points you’ll want to capture once the tools are working.
- A placeholder results table you can fill in as soon as the data sources return.
- A qualitative, data-informed narrative based on TSLA’s typical business model and historical fundamentals (without quoting exact numbers for the current week) to help you think about risk and opportunity while we await the data.

Proposed report structure (to fill once data is accessible)
1) Company profile and business overview
- Segments: Automotive (vehicles, energy efficiency), Energy (storage and solar), and any AI/tech initiatives.
- Geographic mix: contributions from North America, Europe, China, etc.
- Market position: EV leadership, capacity expansion, and key product cadence (Model S/X/3/Y, Cybertruck, Semi, Energy products).
- Recent strategic actions: price changes, capacity expansions, supply chain moves, regulatory/compliance updates.

2) Basic financial snapshot (most recent quarterly data)
- Revenue by segment, total revenue, gross margin, operating margin, EBITDA, net income.
- Free cash flow (FCF), operating cash flow, capital expenditures.
- Balance sheet highlights: cash and equivalents, total debt, liquidity metrics, working capital.
- Key profitability and efficiency metrics: ROIC, ROA, asset turnover, gross margin trend.

3) Financial history and trend analysis (last 4 quarters / last few years)
- Revenue growth rates, gross margin expansion or compression, operating leverage.
- Margin progression: GM, R&D as % revenue, SG&A as % revenue.
- Cash flow stability: operating cash flow vs capex, FCF trends, debt repayments.
- Capital structure evolution: debt mix, maturities, share count impact (if any).

4) Insider sentiment (past ~15 days)
- Net sentiment score and notable mentions within the period.
- Any shifts in tone around product launches, price adjustments, or guidance.
- Relationship to market reaction: does sentiment align with stock moves?

5) Insider transactions (past ~15 days)
- Summary of buys vs sells, by insider group (e.g., executives, board members, large block trades).
- Notable insiders with material purchases or sales.
- Implications for conviction and potential directional bias.

6) Market-relevant risk factors and catalysts
- Risks: supply chain constraints, competition in EV/AI, regulatory changes, margin pressure from price competition, China exposure.
- Catalysts: new product launches, capacity ramps, improved energy storage demand, AI-related monetization.

7) Trader-oriented takeaways
- Where margins are strongest and weakest (by quarter/segment) and why.
- Cash flow resilience under different demand scenarios.
- Insider signals as a corroborating or contrarian indicator.
- Key watchpoints for the next reporting cycle (e.g., CAPEX intensity, debt maturities, segment mix).

What I can do next (options)
- Retry data retrieval immediately if you’d like me to re-run the tools now.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative TSLA fundamentals write-up based on public knowledge up to 2024-06, clearly labeling it as not including latest 1-week data and not substituting for the actual quarterly figures and insider data.
- If you have an alternative data source or a copy of the latest quarterly reports, you can share them and I’ll incorporate them into the report with detailed analysis.

Please let me know how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry the data pull now, or
- Proceed with a qualitative TSLA fundamentals report based on general knowledge (clearly caveated), or
- Supply any available data you want me to analyze immediately.
