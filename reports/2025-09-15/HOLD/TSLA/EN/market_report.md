Thanks for the TSLA request. I attempted to pull the data with get_YFin_data for the date range 2024-09-15 to 2025-09-15, but I hit a internal file-not-found error (FileNotFoundError) on the data fetch. I can retry the data pull, or proceed with a structured indicator plan using the likely TSLA market context and then fill in the specifics once the data is successfully loaded. Below is a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) designed to give complementary insights without redundancy, tailored for TSLA’s typical behavior (volatility, strong trends, momentum shifts, and volume confirmation). If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now and then generate the full, data-driven report.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
1) close_10_ema
- Rationale: A responsive short-term momentum gauge to capture quick shifts in TSLA’s moves, useful for early entry/exit signals when intraday or swing trading.
- Suitability: TSLA is often choppy in the shorter horizon; pairing with longer-term trends helps filter noise.

2) close_50_sma
- Rationale: Medium-term trend baseline to identify ongoing directional bias and dynamic support/resistance.
- Suitability: Helps validate whether short-term moves align with the broader trend.

3) close_200_sma
- Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark; aids in identifying general regime (bullish/bearish) and potential major turning points (golden/death cross contexts).
- Suitability: TSLA’s longer-term moves can show important regime shifts not evident on shorter horizons.

4) macd
- Rationale: Core momentum gauge showing the difference between two EMAs; crossovers around zero provide trend-change signals.
- Suitability: Useful in confirming or challenging signals from the moving averages, especially in persistent trends.

5) macds
- Rationale: MACD signal line; crossovers with the MACD line add a filter to MACD-based entries/exits.
- Suitability: Reduces false positives by requiring a MACD line/signal alignment before acting.

6) rsi
- Rationale: Momentum oscillator highlighting overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; also watch for divergences with price.
- Suitability: In a high-volatility name like TSLA, RSI helps identify extreme conditions that may precede pullbacks or rallies, especially when trend is strong.

7) atr
- Rationale: Measures volatility; informs stop placement and position sizing to manage risk in TSLA’s typical swings.
- Suitability: Important for consistent risk management in a volatile stock; can help adapt exits and risk per trade.

8) vwma
- Rationale: Volume-weighted moving average; adds a volume-confirmation layer to trend interpretation.
- Suitability: TSLA often shows volume-driven moves; VWMA helps validate price action with buying/selling pressure.

Notes on interpretation when data is available
- If price remains above the 200SMA for an extended period with the 50SMA also above the 200SMA, odds favor a sustained uptrend; look for MACD bullish cross and RSI not yet overbought to enter or hold long.
- When price crosses below the 50SMA and 200SMA while MACD turns bearish and RSI breaks below 50, consider risk-managed shorts or exits, especially if ATR expands (increased volatility) and price moves away from VWMA alignment.
- If ATR spikes but price action stays near VWMA with MACD weakening, this can signal rising volatility without a clear directional bias—tighten stops and avoid aggressive entries.
- Divergences between RSI and price (e.g., price making new highs while RSI fails to confirm) can precede pullbacks in an uptrend; confirm with MACD and price position relative to the 50/200 SMAs.

Next steps
- I can retry the data pull with get_YFin_data for TSLA for 2024-09-15 to 2025-09-15. If the environment still errors, I’ll proceed with the indicators above and provide a data-driven interpretation once the data is retrieved.
- Alternatively, we can immediately generate a data-driven analysis using get_stockstats_indicators_report for each indicator once data is accessible.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now and then generate the full, data-driven report using these indicators? If you prefer, I can also proceed with a best-guess interpretation once you confirm you want me to continue without the data fetch.
