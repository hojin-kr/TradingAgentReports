Here is a focused, trading-oriented outlook for TSLA (Tesla, Inc.) covering the past week up to 2025-09-15, incorporating the latest from Finnhub (where available) and Google News signals, plus core macro context. Note: an attempt to fetch Finnhub data for the period encountered an API/file issue in this session, so the narrative leans on Google News coverage for detailed headline-level drivers. If you want, I can re-run Finnhub once the data access issue is resolved or fetch EODHD data when available.

Executive snapshot
- Core drivers last week: AI/robotics narrative remains a strong tailwind for TSLA, reinforced by robotaxi developments, Nevada robotaxi permit news, China demand signals for Model Y, and optimism around energy storage momentum.
- Price/action gist from the period: TSLA traded in a multi-week rally, with reports of prints around a 7-month high and intraday gains roughly in the 6–7% neighborhood on standout days. Headlines tied to robotaxi milestones, potential large pay packages for Elon Musk, and regulatory/legal developments kept sentiment oscillating but broadly constructive for bulls in the mid- to high-300s range.
- Market context: AI/mobility themes supporting high-beta names, with cautious optimism around Fed policy expectations (rate-cut hopes) and attention to demand dynamics in China and Europe. Tesla-specific debates include profitability trajectory, energy-business contribution, and long-run robotics/robotaxi monetization.

Key TSLA headlines and what they imply for traders
- Robotaxi and AI emphasis continues to drive upside: 
  - Nevada robotaxi approvals and ongoing China demand for Model Y buoy sentiment and prime the stock for further upside if pilots scale and monetization accelerates.
  - Headlines tying Elon Musk’s AI/robotics bets to Tesla’s growth story reinforce a multi-year, optionality-like upside in TSLA beyond traditional EV unit sales.
- Energy storage momentum remains a structural bullish theme:
  - Reported strength in Tesla’s energy business alongside EV momentum suggests a more balanced revenue mix, potentially supporting a higher earnings multiple vs. a pure EV play.
- Pay package and governance signals:
  - News around Elon Musk’s pay package (up to $1 trillion) and board commentary on succession/governance can be double-edged: long-horizon alignment vs. near-term political/agency focus risk.
- Legal/regulatory risk chatter:
  - Class-action/litigation headlines are present. While not determinative, they are a typical source of intraday volatility and can cap upside or create downside pauses around headlines.
- Market microstructure signals:
  - Notable options activity around bullish plays on TSLA (e.g., elevated call volume on levered TSLA-related products) points to near-term bullish sentiment embedded in the options market, which can precede or coincide with price moves.

Recent price action and what it signals for levels
- Typical range during the period: multi-day rallies in the week yielded highs near the mid-to-upper 300s, with one report citing a seven-month high around the 370–395 area range. On days of stronger sentiment, intraday prints suggested momentum into the 360s–395+ band.
- Implication for near-term levels:
  - Support: around the 350–365 zone, where earlier pullbacks have tended to find footing.
  - Resistance: near the 395–400 area, which corresponds to recent multi-day highs and a potential psychological/technical milestone stemming from the previous rally.
- What would tilt the balance:
  - Positive Q3 delivery/demand signals, stronger energy-storage bookings, or a clearer path to robotaxi monetization could push TSLA through 400 and toward the 420–450 band if momentum broadens.
  - Adverse developments (profitability compression, weaker-than-expected energy mix, or regulatory/legal headwinds) could see a retest of the 340–360 area or lower.

Macro context and how it interacts with TSLA
- Monetary policy backdrop:
  - Fed rate-cut expectations and the tempo of policy normalization can fuel risk-on breadth, particularly for high-beta secular growth names like TSLA that trade on growth stories (AI, robotaxi, energy storage) rather than pure EV hardware alone.
- Demand dynamics across regions:
  - China and Europe remain critical to long-run demand signals for Model Y and associated energy solutions. Air pockets in demand or tariff/regulatory shifts would be pertinent risk factors.
- Competitive and supply-chain considerations:
  - Competitive pressures from other automakers ramping up EVs, and potential supply-chain frictions, could influence margins and delivery trajectory. Yet Tesla’s energy and robotics bets offer optionality that could offset some EV-specific cyclicality.

Trading implications and potential strategies
- Base/mid-case scenario (probable in the near term): TSLA maintains its momentum on robotaxi progress and energy-storage strength, remaining in the 350–400 band with a bias toward the upside if news flow remains positive. Tactical approach: look for pullbacks toward 360–370 as potential entry zones, with a target toward 395–410 on a breakout through 395–400.
- Upside catalysts: Nevada robotaxi progress, stronger-than-expected Q3 deliveries, or major energy-storage contracts; a clean read on robotaxi monetization could push the stock toward 420–450.
- Downside/risks: regulatory scrutiny related to robotaxi deployments, higher-than-expected expenditure on AI/robotics initiatives without commensurate revenue, or negative litigation headlines; downside risk area around 340–360 if sentiment turns and broad market risk-off returns.
- Options perspective and hedging ideas:
  - Notable call-volume signals on levered TSLA-related instruments suggest near-term bullishness; if you’re risk-aware, consider hedging with vertical spreads around 360–400 or buying wings of a short-duration call spread if you expect continued upside but want defined risk.
  - For a more conservative posture, use a calendar spread around the near-term strike to capture time decay advantages if you anticipate a pause in momentum.

Data gaps and next steps
- Finnhub data gaps: An attempted fetch of Finnhub news for TSLA over 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-15 hit a file/API issue in this session. If you want a fuller cross-source synthesis, I can re-run Finnhub data as soon as access is available.
- EODHD coverage: You asked to include EODHD signals; I can pull those in once I’m able to access that feed. If you have a preferred EODHD feed snippet or a couple of recent headlines, I can weave them into the narrative.
- Reddit/Google News balance: The current narrative leans heavily on Google News signals for TSLA in this period, given the detailed headline-level catalysts. I can pull Reddit sentiment deltas if you want to quantify social media skew or position-sizing implications.

Key takeaways for traders
- The AI/robotics narrative around TSLA remains a persistent driver; robotaxi expansion and energy-storage momentum are the dual-leg growth story supporting a higher multiple vs. a pure EV unit.
- The stock has shown resilience near multi-month highs, with resistance around the 395–400 area and support in the mid- to high-300s. A sustained break above 400 could open a path to 420–450, while a pullback toward 340–360 would warrant a reassessment of momentum and potential hedges.
- Headline risk remains, particularly around regulatory developments, litigation, or governance signals tied to Elon Musk’s compensation package. These can inflect sentiment and intraday volatility.
