Thanks for the prompt. I’m running into a tool error right now.

What happened
- The Reddit stock info tool (get_reddit_stock_info) returned a FileNotFoundError when trying to fetch TSLA data for 2025-09-15. This looks like a runtime/path issue on the tool side, not a user error.

What I can do next
- Retry the Reddit data fetch a few more times to see if the issue resolves.
- If you prefer, proceed with a high-quality, trader-focused qualitative synthesis of TSLA sentiment and news for the past week using other available signals (public news coverage and typical sentiment drivers) while the Reddit tool is down.

Options for you
1) I retry now and continue with a full Reddit-based sentiment/news report once the tool responds.
2) I proceed with a best-effort, trader-focused TSLA analysis based on recent news and general social sentiment signals (without exact Reddit post counts). I’ll still structure it with actionable insights, catalysts, risks, and a markdown-style summary table at the end.

If you’d like me to retry now, I’ll run another attempt immediately. Otherwise, tell me which option you prefer.
