I attempted to fetch PLTR data with get_YFin_data for 2024-09-15 to 2025-09-15, but the data retrieval failed with a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like an issue on the data backend rather than your input. Here’s what we can do next:

Options
- Retry now with the same parameters (same date range).
- Retry with a shorter or different range (e.g., 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-15) to see if the issue is range-specific.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with the plan and prepare the indicator framework and trading insights once data becomes available, then deliver the full, data-driven report when the fetch succeeds.

Proposed indicator framework (8 indicators)
I would select these to provide complementary, non-redundant insights:

1) close_50_sma
2) close_200_sma
3) close_10_ema
4) macd
5) macds
6) macdh
7) rsi
8) boll (Bollinger Middle)

Rationale for the chosen set
- Trend confirmation and context
  - close_50_sma and close_200_sma offer medium- and long-term trend context, helping distinguish between primary trend direction and temporary pullbacks.
  - close_10_ema gives a responsive signal for short-term momentum and potential entry/exit points, useful in volatile periods like PLTR.
- Momentum and signal fidelity
  - MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram together provide a multi-layer view of momentum changes, crossovers, and the strength/velocity of moves. The histogram can help spot early momentum shifts ahead of price crosses.
- Momentum strength and overbought/oversold context
  - RSI adds a classic momentum gauge to flag potential reversals or continuations when price momentum is extreme.
- Volatility/structure context
  - Bollinger Middle (boll) helps gauge price relative to a dynamic 20-period moving average, supporting breakout or mean-reversion assessments in conjunction with the bands (if you later decide to review bands, we’ll bring in boll_ub and boll_lb as needed).

What you’ll get after data is loaded
- A detailed, nuanced narrative describing the prevailing trend, momentum, volatility, and potential scenarios for PLTR, with attention to:
  - How the 50/200 day trend lines align or diverge with the short-term 10 EMA.
  - MACD crossovers/divergences and their consistency with price action.
  - RSI positioning relative to overbought/oversold zones and any divergence with price.
  - Bollinger Middle context to assess breakout vs. mean-reversion risk.
- A concise decision-support section outlining potential entry/exit ideas under current conditions, plus caveats about false signals in range-bound markets.
- A Markdown table at the end that consolidates key observations and signals (one row per indicator with a brief takeaway).

Next steps
- Please tell me which option you prefer:
  1) Retry the data fetch now with the same PLTR 2024-09-15 to 2025-09-15 window.
  2) Retry with a different date range (e.g., 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-15).
  3) If you’re okay with waiting, I’ll reattempt and then deliver the full, data-backed report with the 8-indicator framework and the final table as soon as the data loads.

As soon as the data fetch succeeds, I’ll produce the detailed trend report and the appended Markdown table.
