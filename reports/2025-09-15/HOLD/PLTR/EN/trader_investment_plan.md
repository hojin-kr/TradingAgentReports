Recommendation: Hold PLTR for now.

Rationale (concise):
- The plan you shared presents a credible bull case (durable ARR growth, cross-sell potential, ecosystem leverage) but is tempered by meaningful risks (valuation, macro spend cycles, government procurement visibility, and potential moat erosion as cloud-native tools evolve). In the near term, data signaling (ARR growth, margin leverage, contract visibility) remains the critical gatekeeper to a more constructive stance.
- Until we see credible, sustained progress in ARR expansion and margin improvement, the risk-reward favors staying on the sidelines rather than committing aggressively.

Key triggers that would justify upgrading to Buy:
- ARR acceleration: sustained multi-quarter net-dollar expansion with meaningful cross-sell contributions driving higher contracted ARR.
- Margin improvement: sequential gross margin expansion with SG&A leverage as revenue scales.
- Clear contract visibility: multiple, sizable defense/government wins and enterprise deployments with longer durations and higher ARR per contract.
- Ecosystem validation: tangible, expanding deals tied to Oracle or other major cloud ecosystems that meaningfully lift ARR/retention.

Warning signs that would warrant a downgrade to Sell:
- Booking momentum slows meaningfully, renewals stall, or gross margins flatten/contract.
- Defense/government visibility deteriorates or and/or near-term pipeline weakens.
- Valuation remains elevated without tangible, credible catalysts or there’s a material macro headwind.

Execution plan (practical steps):
- Position sizing: maintain a modest exposure (1–3% of portfolio) with defined stop levels at key technical supports.
- Entry approach: use staged allocation if entering on dips, then layer in on confirming momentum signals.
- Risk hedges: consider protective puts or collars if taking a larger PLTR position.
- Monitoring cadence: quarterly reviews focused on ARR, net retention, bookings, and gross margin trajectory; track government pipeline and cross-sell metrics.
- Time horizon: primary focus 3–6 months, with potential extension to 6–12 months if catalysts materialize.

If clear catalysts emerge (per triggers above), be prepared to shift to Buy with a disciplined plan and defined price targets and trailing stops. If conditions deteriorate, trim or exit with defined risk controls.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
