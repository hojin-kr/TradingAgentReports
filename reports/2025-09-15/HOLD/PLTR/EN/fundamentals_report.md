Sorry—the data fetch failed due to a tool environment error (FileNotFoundError). I wasn’t able to retrieve insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the latest balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement for PLTR right now.

What I can do next (choose one):
- Option 1: Retry data retrieval now. I’ll attempt the full set (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) for PLTR with curr_date 2025-09-15 and then deliver a comprehensive fundamental report with a detailed, trader-oriented analysis and a final Markdown table of key points.
- Option 2: Proceed with a qualitative, fundamentals-focused overview based on publicly available information up to the current date (without the latest tool-backed figures). I’ll clearly mark any data that would normally come from the missing tool outputs.
- Option 3: Break down into smaller steps (e.g., first retry insider sentiment and insider transactions; once those succeed, fetch the financial statements).

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like me to retry, I’ll run the full data pull immediately and report back with:
- Company profile and basic financials
- Most recent quarterly/annual income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statements
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions over the past 15 days
- Fine-grained analysis with insights for traders (revenues, margins, cash flow quality, balance sheet strength, insider activity)
- A concluding Markdown table summarizing the key points and metrics

Would you like me to retry the full dataset now?
