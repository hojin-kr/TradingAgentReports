Sorry — I hit a tool error trying to fetch Reddit data for PLTR on 2025-09-15.

Error details observed:
- FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')
- This indicates the Reddit data retrieval service is currently unavailable or misconfigured on my end.

What I can do next (your call):
1) Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately if you’d like.
2) Retry later: I can wait and retry in a follow-up message.
3) Proceed without Reddit data: I can continue with a high-quality, trader-focused analysis based on available company news, filings, and general sentiment signals from other sources (if you have access to those, or I can stick to what I can reliably report now and fill in Reddit sentiment once the tool is back).
4) Use an alternative date window: If you want a broader view, I can analyze PLTR sentiment and news for a nearby date range once Reddit data is accessible.

Given you asked to “continue,” I can either retry now or shift to an all-source report (excluding Reddit) and then incorporate Reddit sentiment as soon as the tool is fixed.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry Reddit fetch now
- Retry later
- Proceed without Reddit data (and I’ll build a detailed PLTR analysis with other sources)
- Provide an alternative data source I should use (if you have one in mind)

Once I have clarity, I’ll deliver a detailed long-form report with insights for traders and a final Markdown table summarizing key points.
