I ran into a tool error fetching Reddit data for QQQ on 2025-09-15: FileNotFoundError. I can retry if the system allows, but the Reddit data source appears unavailable at the moment. In the meantime, here’s a robust plan and a ready-to-fill framework so we can proceed quickly once the data feed is back, or we can proceed with a qualitative analysis using other signals if you’d like.

What I propose to deliver (once data access is restored or other signals are provided)
- A comprehensive, trader-focused long-form report analyzing social media posts, sentiment, and public news for QQQ over the past week.
- Fine-grained insights on daily sentiment shifts, top themes, and implications for price action and volatility.
- A synthesis of recent news and crowd sentiment into actionable takeaways for traders (short-term tilt, risk factors, and potential setups).
- A clear, easy-to-skim Markdown table at the end summarizing key points by day/source/theme.

Current status and options
- Status: Reddit data feed is currently unavailable due to a tool error.
- Options:
  1) Retry data retrieval as soon as the tool is available, and then produce the full report with Reddit signals included.
  2) Proceed now with a qualitative framework using other available signals (e.g., general social sentiment workflows, public news headlines, macro context) and clearly label what is data-derived versus qualitative. If you prefer this route, I’ll proceed and clearly annotate placeholders where Reddit data will be integrated once the feed is restored.

Proposed report structure (live-ready, once data is in)
- Executive snapshot: What the last 7 days imply for QQQ’s near-term risk/reward, given tech exposure and macro context.
- Data-driven sentiment lens:
  - Daily sentiment trajectory (positivity/negativity/neutral)
  - Volume of social chatter and notable spikes
  - Dominant topics (AI hype, macro/fed commentary, earnings chatter, policy/regulatory topics, fund flows)
- News synthesis:
  - Recurring themes in headlines (earnings, product launches, regulatory moves, macro data)
  - How headlines could impact investor sentiment and ETF flows into QQQ
- Thematic drivers for traders:
  - Tech sector momentum vs. macro risk
  - AI/large-cap tech narratives and potential overhangs
  - Portfolio flow implications for an Nasdaq-100 heavy ETF
- Risk matrix:
  - Market regime risk, sector concentration risk, sentiment-driven volatility risk
- Trade ideas and scenarios:
  - Short-term tilt (e.g., if sentiment remains robust but macro risk rises)
  - Range-aware positioning, hedging considerations
  - If sell-the-news or rally-fade patterns emerge
- Key takeaways and indicators to watch
- Appendices:
  - Methodology notes (sentiment scoring approach, data sources, limitations)
  - Data caveats and confidence levels

What I need from you to proceed efficiently
- Please confirm which path you’d like:
  - Path A: Retry the Reddit data feed now and then generate the full report with Reddit included.
  - Path B: Proceed with a qualitative framework now (no Reddit data) and clearly mark Reddit data as pending.
- If you have any preferred emphasis (e.g., more focus on macro drivers, or more emphasis on micro-movement around tech giants within QQQ), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis.

Draft Markdown table (to be filled with the data once available)
- I’m including a ready-to-use table structure so you can drop in data quickly later. This will be appended at the end of the final report.

Next steps
- Tell me which path you prefer. If you want, I can also draft a preliminary qualitative analysis right away (without Reddit) to give you an early read, and then quickly slot in Reddit insights as soon as the tool becomes available again.

Note on the ticker
- QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) tracking the Nasdaq-100. For sentiment analysis, we’ll interpret signals in the context of a tech-heavy, growth-oriented index, with attention to AI-related narratives, tech earnings cadence, and macro/regulatory headlines that influence tech equities.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data feed now, or proceed with the qualitative framework (Path B) and keep Reddit data as a pending item?
