Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest data via the provided tools, but all attempts returned a FileNotFoundError indicating the data service is currently unavailable or misconfigured on my end.

What I can do next (options):
- Retry now: I can try to fetch the data again in a moment and continue with the full fundamental report once the tools are reachable.
- ETF-focused analysis right now: Since QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) and not a single company, traditional company-level financial statements and insider activity don’t apply. I can still provide a comprehensive ETF-focused framework, including:
  - Fund basics: objective, tracking index, expense ratio, inception date, total assets, liquidity metrics (average daily trading volume, bid-ask spread proxies).
  - Holdings and concentration: overview of the top holdings by weight, typical sector exposure (e.g., tech-heavy exposure), and how concentration risk may affect performance.
  - Performance drivers: correlation with major tech indices, macro sensitivities (rates, growth, tech cycle), and historical drawdowns.
  - Risk factors: tracking error vs. index, liquidity risk in stressed markets, issuer risk, and currency considerations (if any).
  - Income/distributions: typical dividend yield and distribution schedule (even though ETFs don’t have financial statements like a corporate issuer, yield and distribution history are relevant).
  - Valuation context: how the ETF’s performance aligns with the NASDAQ-100 and the typical upside/downside catalysts (large-cap tech earnings, AI-driven demand, policy/regulatory changes).
  - Holdings snapshot method: I can outline how to interpret the top holdings and sector weights, and how changes in the fund’s holdings might impact risk/return.
- If you want detailed, data-backed ETF specifics, I can retry the data pulls as soon as the service is available and then fill in precise figures (e.g., current expense ratio, total assets, latest distribution yield, and the latest top holdings and sector weights).
- If you have a preferred alternative data source or want me to analyze a specific constituent within QQQ (e.g., AAPL or MSFT) as a proxy for the fund’s exposure, I can fetch and analyze that company’s fundamentals using the existing tools.

Notes:
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions are not applicable to an ETF like QQQ in the same way they are for a single company. If you want, we can still discuss the broader market sentiment and thematic drivers affecting technology and growth names, but it won’t be insider-transactions data for QQQ itself.
- Once the data service is reachable again, I’ll proceed with a full, detailed fundamental report that includes: fund-level fundamentals, holdings/drill-downs, risk factors, and a concise trader-focused interpretation, plus a final Markdown table summarizing key points.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry fetching the data now and proceed with a full report as soon as it’s available, or
2) Proceed with a thorough ETF-focused qualitative framework right away, with placeholders or guidance on how to fill in precise numbers when data becomes available?
