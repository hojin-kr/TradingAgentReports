Thanks for your patience. I attempted to fetch QQQ data via get_YFin_data, but the tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I’ve retried several times with no success. This looks like an internal/tool issue rather than a problem with the QQQ data itself. I can keep retrying, or if you’d prefer, I can proceed with a plan and prepare the analysis layout so that once data access is restored, I can produce a full, data-driven report immediately.

In the meantime, here is a robust plan you can use for QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF), using up to 8 complementary indicators. These provide a mix of trend, momentum, and volatility insights without redundancy.

Proposed indicators (8 max) and rationale
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; useful for filtering noise when used with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Longer-term trend benchmark; helps confirm regime (bullish vs bearish) and catch major trend changes.
- close_10_ema: 10-period exponential moving average. Captures quick momentum shifts; good for early entry timing when aligned with trend filters.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum-based signal; crossovers with the MACD line help flag potential trend changes.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoothing of MACD; MACD vs MACDS crossovers provide cleaner trigger signals in conjunction with price context.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength gauge; divergence with price can warn of impending reversals or weakening trends.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum/readiness for overbought/oversold contexts; divergence with price adds nuance beyond trend signals.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility to inform risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and to adapt to changing market volatility.

Why these are suitable for QQQ
- QQQ often trades in mixed regimes (trending rallies, pullbacks, and consolidation phases). The combination above covers trend confirmation (50/200SMA), quick momentum shifts (10 EMA, MACD trio), and risk control (ATR) while avoiding overlap with volume-only or stochastic-only signals.
- This set balances lagging trend confirmations (SMA) with more responsive momentum (MACD components, RSI) and a robust volatility/risk metric (ATR). It’s designed to reduce noise in choppy sessions while still offering timely entry/exit signals when combined.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced market view for QQQ over the requested window (and the current date context). I’ll compute the eight indicators, generate a trends-and-signals narrative, identify confluence or divergence patterns, and translate them into actionable insights (entry/exit hints, risk considerations).
- Cross-indicator confirmation: how multiple indicators align (e.g., price above 50SMA with MACD bulls and RSI non-extreme).
- Contextual notes on regime shifts (e.g., transitioning from range-bound to trending, increased ATR suggesting higher risk).
- Practical trading ideas and risk management considerations tailored to QQQ’s behavior in the period.

Next steps
- I can keep retrying to fetch the data now, or you can confirm I should proceed with the planned indicator set and generate the report as soon as data access is restored.
- If you’d like, I can also prep an alternative using a fallback data source or a smaller look-back window to get a quick initial read once the tool is back online.

Markdown table: quick reference for the chosen indicators and their roles
| Indicator | Role | What to look for in signals |
|-----------|------|-----------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Trend direction / dynamic support | Price above/below 50SMA indicates uptrend/downtrend; crossovers with price can hint pullbacks or accelerations. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above 200SMA suggests long-term bullish context; below suggests bearish context; crossovers (Golden/Death) signal regime change. |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above/below 10EMA signals short-term momentum; crossovers with price help timing entries/exits. |
| macd | Momentum trend changes | MACD line crosses above/below zero or MACD with price confirms potential trend changes; look for convergence/divergence with price. |
| macds | MACD signal line | MACD vs MACDS crossovers strengthen signals; used to filter MACD cross signals for entries/exits. |
| macdh | MACD histogram momentum | Histogram expansion/contraction signals momentum strength; divergences can warn of reversals when combined with price. |
| rsi | Overbought/oversold momentum | RSI extremes (e.g., >70 or <30) indicate potential reversals; look for divergence with price for stronger signals. |
| atr | Volatility/risk management | Rising ATR implies increasing volatility; use to adjust stops and sizing; stable ATR supports tighter risk controls. |

Important: I’ll be ready to run get_stockstats_indicators_report for each indicator (curr_date today, look_back_days to suit your preference, e.g., 30 or 60) and then compile the detailed trend report with a full, readable narrative plus the final table of signals.

Would you like me to keep retrying the data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with this planned analysis framework as soon as data access is restored? If you want, I can also switch to a different ticker (e.g., SPY or QQQX) or adjust the date window.
