Sorry about that—the Reddit stock info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch the latest Reddit data for AAPL right now.

Here are options to move forward. Tell me which you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly:

Option A — Retry and fetch Reddit data
- I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch for AAPL on 2025-09-15 as soon as the tool is back up and then compile the full, data-driven report with sentiment by day and recent news.
- I’ll append a Markdown table at the end summarizing key sentiment drivers, notable news, and implications for traders.

Option B — Proceed with a best-effort, sources-only analysis (no Reddit data)
- I’ll produce a comprehensive long report using available public sources (press releases, Apple’s newsroom, earnings updates, major outlets) plus a sentiment-focused synthesis from other social channels you specify (e.g., X/Twitter, Threads, stock forums) if you provide access to those data feeds.
- I’ll clearly label where data is coming from and note any gaps due to data access issues.
- I’ll include a final Markdown table with key takeaways, catalysts, risks, and trade implications.

Option C — Hybrid approach
- I draft the core report based on non-Reddit sources now (news, earnings context, macro factors, regulatory environment) and then, as soon as Reddit data becomes available, I’ll augment the report with day-by-day Reddit sentiment and update the table accordingly.

If you’d like, I can also proceed with a high-level framework right away (without the Reddit feed) and fill in the specifics once data becomes available.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to proceed now with Option B or C, I’ll start assembling a thorough, trader-focused analysis and deliver a detailed report with a final Markdown table.
