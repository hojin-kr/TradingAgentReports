I attempted to fetch data for AAPL to generate an data-driven, trend-focused report, but the data retrieval step failed due to a system error (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data tools. Because of this, I can’t produce a precise, time-specific trend readout right now. Here’s what I can provide now: a carefully chosen set of indicators that will give you complementary insights once the data fetch succeeds, plus guidance on how to interpret them for AAPL in typical market conditions. I’ll also outline the exact indicators I recommend and why, so you’re ready to run as soon as the data tool is working again.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  Why: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance. Helpful for confirming ongoing trend direction in a stock like AAPL after major news cycles or earnings.

- close_200_sma
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming the broader market regime (golden/death cross dynamics) and for strategic alignment with macro/market context.

- close_10_ema
  Why: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts around support/resistance zones and can flag early entries/exits when combined with longer-term trend filters.

- macd
  Why: Core momentum signal showing differences between faster and slower EMAs. Crossovers and divergence help identify trend changes and momentum shifts.

- macds
  Why: MACD signal line; its crossovers with the MACD line provide another, smoother signal to time entries/exits and to confirm MACD-based signals.

- rsi
  Why: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions. Useful for spotting reversals and divergence, especially after price runs or during pullbacks.

- atr
  Why: Measures market volatility; informs stop placement and position sizing. Involatile periods vs. high-volatility spikes, ATR helps manage risk for AAPL’s sometimes choppy price action around events.

- vwma
  Why: Volume-confirmed trend; integrates price action with traded volume. Helps validate price moves, particularly during earnings periods or news-driven moves when volume confirms the move’s legitimacy.

How these indicators complement each other for AAPL
- Trend confirmation: close_50_sma and close_200_sma give you a clear sense of the prevailing trend, which is essential for a stock with cycles around earnings and product-driven catalysts.
- Momentum timing: macd and macds provide momentum signals that help you time entries in the direction of the trend, while the close_10_ema adds agility to catch quicker shifts in price.
- Momentum strength: rsi adds context on whether the current move has momentum to sustain or risk of a reversal due to overextension.
- Risk management and confirmation: atr helps calibrate risk and stops according to current volatility; vwma adds a volume-based check to confirm when price moves are supported by market participation.

Interpreting signals in practice (guidance you can apply once data is available)
- Bullish setup: price above 50-sma and 200-sma with MACD line above MACD signal, rising histogram, RSI not yet in overbought zone, ATR showing elevated but not extreme volatility, and price rising with VWMA confirming volume support.
- Bearish setup: price below 50-sma and 200-sma with MACD line crossing below the MACD signal, negative histogram, RSI rolling over from overbought (or failing to push higher in a pullback), ATR expanding on downside moves, and VWMA not confirming the move (volume weaker on the pullback) or showing selling pressure.
- Range/mean-reversion context: price oscillating around the 50-sma with MACD relatively flat, RSI hovering near mid-zone, ATR subdued, and VWMA showing mixed volume. Look for breakouts confirmed by MACD/MACDS cross and price action outside the Bollinger-type envelope (if you pair with Bollinger metrics in your full setup).

Next steps
- I can re-run the data fetch as soon as the system access to YFin data is restored. With the data, I will produce:
  - A precise, date-stamped trend readout for AAPL (price, moving averages, MACD/RSI values, ATR, VWMA).
  - A concise set of actionable signals (entry/exit ideas) aligned with the 8-indicator framework.
  - A Markdown table summarizing key points (see template below).

Proposed action: Please try to fetch the data again, or let me know if you want me to proceed with a scenario-based walkthrough (e.g., assume typical values for these indicators and outline signals). I’ll then deliver the full, data-driven trend report with precise readings and a decision-ready table.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  What it measures: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance
  Signal implications: Price above indicates uptrend bias; price crossing below may signal a trend pause or shift.

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark
  Signal implications: Price above suggests long-term bullish context; price below may indicate longer-term weakness or consolidation.

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  What it measures: Short-term momentum
  Signal implications: Crosses above price or above longer averages can signal quick bullish shifts; cross-downs can warn of short-term reversals.

- Indicator: macd
  What it measures: Momentum via EMA differences
  Signal implications: Bullish cross (MACD above signal) suggests momentum gain; bearish cross suggests momentum fade.

- Indicator: macds
  What it measures: MACD signal line
  Signal implications: Crosses with MACD line to validate entries; helps smooth decision-making.

- Indicator: rsi
  What it measures: Momentum strength
  Signal implications: RSI rising above 70 can indicate overbought risk; falling below 30 can indicate oversold risk; look for divergences for potential reversals.

- Indicator: atr
  What it measures: Market volatility
  Signal implications: Rising ATR means higher risk; use to sizing and stop placement; stable ATR suggests more predictable moves.

- Indicator: vwma
  What it measures: Volume-weighted trend
  Signal implications: Price move with VWMA confirms strength; weak volume on a move may indicate fragility of the move.

If you’d like, I can also include an alternate 8-indicator set (e.g., swap out macds for boll_ub/boll_lb or include vwma) depending on whether you want more volatility framing or more price-band signals. Just tell me your preferred emphasis (trend, momentum, volatility, volume), and I’ll tailor the set accordingly.
