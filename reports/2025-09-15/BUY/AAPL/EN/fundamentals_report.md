I tried to fetch the latest fundamental data for AAPL using the available data tools, but I encountered a FileNotFoundError from the data backend. This means I can’t deliver the data-driven sections right now. I can either retry the data fetch in a moment, or proceed with a qualitative, data-limited analysis and outline what I would include once the data is available. Which option would you prefer?

Options
- Retry now: I’ll attempt to pull balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, insider sentiment, and insider transactions again and then produce a full, data-backed report.
- Qualitative-first: I’ll provide a structured, trader-oriented analysis framework with placeholders where the latest numbers would go, along with the key questions and risk factors you should watch for until the data is retrievable.
- Other data sources: If you have alternate data feeds or credentials, share them and I’ll use those.

What I can deliver right now (structure you’ll get once data is available)
I will assemble a comprehensive report covering:
- Company profile and recent context
- Financial snapshot (summary figures once retrieved)
- Income statement (revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, margins)
- Balance sheet (assets, liabilities, equity; liquidity posture)
- Cash flow statement (operating cash flow, investing, financing; free cash flow)
- Key financial metrics and ratios (margins, ROA, ROE, liquidity, leverage, coverage)
- Revenue and profit history (trends over the last several quarters/years)
- Insider sentiment (overall tone and any notable signals from insiders)
- Insider transactions (net buys/sells, notable executives)
- Catalyst and risk assessment (product cycles, supply chain, macro effects, regulatory)
- Trader-oriented takeaways (valuation context, momentum, catalysts, thresholds)
- Appendix: Markdown table to summarize key points

Proposed Markdown table (structure to organize key points)
Please note: This is a template. I will populate it with actual values once data is available.

Next steps
- Please tell me which option you prefer: retry now, proceed qualitatively, or share alternative data sources.
- If you’d like me to proceed qualitatively right away, I will produce a detailed, trader-focused analysis with clearly labeled placeholders for the data points I would fill in once the data fetch succeeds.
- If you want me to retry immediately, I’ll run the data fetch again and deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as responses come back.
