I attempted to fetch data and run the specified indicators for META, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError. Because I don’t have the underlying data in this moment, I can’t deliver precise, data-driven trend observations right now. I can still provide a solid indicator framework (which you can run once the data fetch works) and a detailed interpretation guide tailored to META’s typical market dynamics.

Selected indicators (8), chosen for complementary insights and to minimize redundancy
- close_200_sma
- close_50_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these eight and how they complement each other
- close_200_sma (long-term trend anchor): Establishes the overall market bias (bullish in price above, bearish in price below). Helpful for META’s multi-year growth narrative and major regime shifts (e.g., changes in ad spend, AI strategy, user engagement).
- close_50_sma (mid-term trend filter): Tracks the intermediate trend and acts as a dynamic support/resistance level. Useful for confirming or questioning the 200-SMA signal and for identifying intermediate pullbacks that could be entry points.
- close_10_ema (short-term momentum): Captures quick shifts in price momentum, which is valuable around earnings, product launches, or regulatory news. Prone to noise in choppy markets, so benefits from corroboration with longer-term indicators.
- macd (momentum direction): Provides a momentum view and helps identify potential trend changes via crossovers and divergences. Complements price-based trend signals from SMAs.
- macds (MACD signal line): Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD add signaling nuance and can reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- macdh (MACD histogram): Visualizes momentum strength and divergence direction early; useful for confirming MACD/Crossover signals and assessing momentum acceleration or deceleration.
- rsi (relative momentum strength): Signals overbought/oversold conditions and divergences. Helps assess momentum sustainability, especially in pronounced uptrends or downtrends Meta often experiences around earnings or platform shifts.
- atr (volatility): Aids risk management by normalizing position sizing and stop placement according to current volatility. Important around events (earnings, regulatory decisions) where volatility can spike.

How to interpret these together (high-level framework you can apply once you have data)
- Confirmed uptrend setup:
  - Price above 200_SMA and 50_SMA; 50_SMA trending up; price near or above 10_EMA with the 10_EMA above 50_SMA.
  - MACD line above the signal, MACD histogram positive and rising; RSI trending mid-to-high (e.g., 50–70) without extreme overbought levels; ATR rising modestly indicates sustainable volatility rather than parabolic moves.
  - Practical read: Look for pullbacks to the 50_SMA or 10_EMA as potential entries, with stop placement based on ATR (e.g., a multiple of ATR below entry).
- Confirmed downtrend setup:
  - Price below 200_SMA and 50_SMA; 50_SMA trending down; price testing or breaking below 10_EMA.
  - MACD below zero, MACD signal lagging; MACD histogram negative and increasing in magnitude (more negative); RSI below midline (e.g., <50) but not in extreme oversold; ATR rising on downside moves indicating genuine momentum rather than a quiet drift.
  - Practical read: Consider lighter exposures or wait for a MACD/MACD-Signal bearish cross with continued price weakness. Use ATR to set wider stop ranges during higher volatility periods (e.g., around earnings).
- Mixed/sideways market:
  - Price oscillating around SMAs; MACD nearby zero; RSI bouncing around 40–60; ATR relatively flat.
  - Practical read: Favor range-bound strategies or wait for a strong breakout/breakdown confirmed by multiple signals (MACD movement + price break of a key SMA with ATR expansion).

META-specific considerations to keep in mind
- Earnings and AI strategy announcements frequently drive volatility: ATR will be useful to size risk around those events; tighten or loosen stops accordingly.
- Ad revenue dynamics and platform usage trends influence long-term trend signals (200_SMA, 50_SMA) more than short-term oscillations; combine macro sentiment with momentum signals for timing.
- MACD histograms can help identify momentum fatigue during extended rallies or declines, which is common after multi-quarter upgrades or regulatory/competition news.
- RSI divergences (e.g., price making a new high while RSI fails to surpass previous high) can precede trend reversals and are worth watching in META’s growth narratives.

Risk and trade setup notes
- Always confirm signals with at least one additional indicator (e.g., price action around a major SMA, or a MACD cross followed by RSI not entering overbought territory).
- Use ATR for position sizing and stop losses to adapt to changing volatility, especially around earnings.
- Be mindful of the possibility of false breakouts in high-volatility periods; wait for multi-indicator confirmation before entering.

What I can do next (once data retrieval works)
- Re-run the eight indicators for META with the exact look_back_days you specified.
- Produce a detailed, data-driven trend narrative describing the exact alignment (or misalignment) of these indicators as of 2025-09-15, including:
  - Current price relative to the 200_SMA and 50_SMA
  - MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram levels
  - RSI reading and any notable divergences
  - ATR level and recent volatility context
  - Any back-tested or example trade setups based on the combined signals
- Append a precise Markdown table summarizing the indicator readings and interpretation for META.

Request to proceed
- If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now. If there’s a persistent environment issue, I can continue with the framework above and deliver a precise, data-driven report as soon as the data becomes available.

Markdown table: key points (indicator roles and readouts)
- Note: This table is a template you can populate with actual values once data loads.

| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to read for META | Practical trading note |
|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 200_SMA indicates bullish/bearish long-term bias; cross with price for potential regime shift | Use for major trend confirmation; prefer entries aligned with long-term trend |
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Mid-term trend direction | Price relative to 50_SMA; 50_SMA slope indicates intermediate trend strength | Use with 200_SMA to identify golden/death cross contexts; watch pullbacks to SMA levels |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum | Price crosses above/below 10_EMA; momentum shifts more quickly | Helpful for timing entries in line with longer-term trend |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend changes | MACD line vs. signal; positive vs. negative; crossovers signal potential entries/exits | Confirm with price action and other indicators to avoid false positives |
| macds | MACD Signal | MACD smoothing | Signals on cross with MACD line; supports/disputes trend direction | Use to filter trended vs. range conditions |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Histogram rising/falling; divergence with price | Divergences can precede trend reversals or acceleration |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold, momentum strength | RSI level and divergences; typical thresholds 70/30 | Watch for divergences and confirm with trend indicators |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level | Higher ATR = more volatile; used to set stops/position sizing | Scale risk management to current volatility; adjust stops around earnings/events |

If you’d prefer, I can attempt the data fetch again now and then deliver the full, data-backed narrative plus a filled-in table. Would you like me to retry the data retrieval for META now?
