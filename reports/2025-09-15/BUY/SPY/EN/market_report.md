Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch SPY data to generate the indicators you asked for, but I hit a tool error (FileNotFoundError) when calling get_YFin_data. I can proceed with a solid indicator plan and a detailed framework, and I can re-run the data fetch as soon as the data service is available. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 complementary indicators tailored for SPY (an ETF representing the broad U.S. equity market) along with how to interpret them and why they fit SPY’s typical market conditions.

Selected indicators (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; a medium-term trend benchmark.
  - Why for SPY: Helps identify the ongoing trend direction and acts as dynamic support/resistance. SPY often oscillates around the 50SMA in range-bound phases and follows it in trendier regimes.
  - Signals to watch: Price above 50SMA suggests a bullish intermediate trend; price below suggests bearish or corrective pressure. Cross of price crossing the 50SMA can indicate a short-term regime shift.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; a long-term trend benchmark.
  - Why for SPY: Serves as a long-term context anchor. Useful to confirm dominant regime (bullish when price above, bearish when below).
  - Signals to watch: Price above 200SMA generally aligns with a broader uptrend; price below 200SMA reflects a longer-term bearish tone or pullback. Golden/death cross concepts can be informative when you pair with faster indicators.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average; a responsive, short-term momentum gauge.
  - Why for SPY: Captures quick shifts in momentum and can signal entry/exit points when combined with longer-term trend signals.
  - Signals to watch: Price crossing above/below the 10EMA can indicate near-term momentum changes. Use with the 50SMA/200SMA to filter false moves in choppy markets.
- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Momentum derived from differences between short and long EMAs; momentum and trend-change signals.
  - Why for SPY: MACD crossovers and histogram dynamics help identify shifts in momentum in a broad market with frequent regime changes.
  - Signals to watch: MACD line crossing the signal line, and histogram expansion/contraction, to confirm trend changes suggested by price action and moving averages.
- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: Relative strength momentum to gauge overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why for SPY: In markets with strong moves, RSI can remain extended for extended periods; using RSI with trend context helps identify potential reversals or pullbacks.
  - Signals to watch: RSI > 70 overbought signals potential pullbacks; RSI < 30 oversold signals potential bounces. Look for divergence with price or alignment with trend signals from MAs and MACD.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - What it measures: 20-day SMA that forms the middle band of Bollinger Bands.
  - Why for SPY: Establishes a dynamic baseline for price deviation and helps identify mean-reversion vs. breakout tendencies in SPY’s volatility regimes.
  - Signals to watch: Price around or crossing the middle band (20SMA) can indicate mean-reversion pressure; use with bands to assess breakout/relief moves.
- boll_ub (Bollinger Upper Band)
  - What it measures: Upper Bollinger Band (middle band plus 2 standard deviations).
  - Why for SPY: Signals potential overbought zones or breakout opportunities when price digs above the band, especially in a strong uptrend.
  - Signals to watch: Price touching or crossing the upper band can indicate near-term exhaustion or the start of a continuation breakout, depending on context from MSP trends and RSI.
- vwma (VWMA)
  - What it measures: Volume-weighted moving average; price action filtered by volume.
  - Why for SPY: Volume confirmation is critical for SPY moves, as it helps differentiate sustainable moves from weak rallies or false breakouts.
  - Signals to watch: Price action above VWMA with rising volume strengthens bullish moves; price below VWMA with declining volume strengthens bearish moves. Use to confirm other signals (e.g., MACD, RSI) in the same direction.

How to use these indicators together (practical approach)
- Timeframe: Focus on daily bars for SPY to capture medium-term trends with a blend of short-term momentum (10EMA) and long-term context (200SMA).
- Confirmation framework: 
  - Trend confirmation: Price above 50SMA and 200SMA supports a bullish stance; price below both supports a bearish stance.
  - Momentum confirmation: Use MACD in conjunction with RSI. A bullish signal occurs when MACD crosses up and RSI is not in overbought territory; bearish signal when MACD crosses down and RSI is not oversold.
  - Volatility and breakout context: Bollinger middle and upper band give context for mean-reversion vs. breakout; use 20SMA as a dynamic baseline, with upper band signaling potential overbought pressure or breakout zones. 
  - Volume support: VWMA adds a volume-backed filter. Positive price action that is also above VWMA with rising volume is more confirmatory than price action alone.
- Risk management: Use ATR-derived ideas indirectly by observing volatility regimes via Bollinger width and price interaction with bands, and adjust position sizing accordingly. Since ATR isn’t selected here, you may still track volatility implicitly through band behavior and price-range dynamics.

Notes and caveats
- Data access: I’ll re-run the data fetch as soon as the data service is available again. Once SPY data is loaded, I’ll compute the indicators and provide a detailed trend report with concrete observations for the current window (the latest available data up to 2025-09-15).
- Redundancy avoidance: I avoided including multiple members of the same indicator family beyond MACD (I included MACD as a single momentum signal rather than its subcomponents) to keep the set diverse and actionable.
- Context-specific considerations: SPY behavior can vary with macro regimes (rate changes, macro growth, geopolitics). Use this set as a framework to read regime shifts rather than as a single-rule system.

Next steps
- I’ll reattempt data retrieval for SPY (2024-01-01 to 2025-09-15) and then compute the indicators. After that, I’ll deliver:
  - A detailed trend report with granular observations (cross-checks across indicators, regime analysis, and implied probabilities for near-term moves).
  - Actionable takeaways with example entry/exit considerations tied to the current market context.
  - A Markdown table summarizing the indicators, signals, and interpretation for quick reference.

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and interpretation (ready-to-use reference)
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance
  - Interpretation: Price above = bullish intermediate trend; price below = bearish/corrective; cross signals potential regime shift when combined with other indicators
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - Purpose: Long-term trend context
  - Interpretation: Price above = long-term uptrend bias; price below = long-term downtrend bias; golden/death cross cues when combined with other signals
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - Purpose: Short-term momentum
  - Interpretation: Price above = positive near-term momentum; price crosses below = potential short-term pullback
- Indicator: macd
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change detection
  - Interpretation: MACD line above signal = bullish momentum; MACD line below signal = bearish momentum; larger histogram = stronger momentum
- Indicator: rsi
  - Purpose: Overbought/oversold and momentum strength
  - Interpretation: RSI > 70 = possible overbought (pullback risk); RSI < 30 = possible oversold (bounce risk); look for divergences
- Indicator: boll
  - Purpose: Mean reversion baseline
  - Interpretation: Price around middle band signals mean reversion; sustained moves away from the middle band with band expansion can indicate breakout potential
- Indicator: boll_ub
  - Purpose: Overbought/breakout context
  - Interpretation: Price touching/creaking the upper band can indicate overbought conditions or a breakout zone; confirm with other signals
- Indicator: vwma
  - Purpose: Volume-confirmed price action
  - Interpretation: Price above VWMA with rising volume strengthens bullish signals; price below VWMA with declining volume strengthens bearish signals

Please confirm if you’d like me to retry fetching SPY data now, or if you prefer I proceed with the analysis flow once the data retrieval succeeds. If you have a preferred time window (e.g., last 6–12 months) or a specific sub-period to scrutinize, tell me and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.
