I attempted to pull the Reddit sentiment data for SPY across the requested dates (2025-09-15 to 2025-09-09) in parallel, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the Reddit data fetcher is currently unavailable or misconfigured, so I can’t fetch the social sentiment data right now.

What I can do right now
- Provide a clear plan and a draft structure for the long-form report you want, so we’re ready to fill in with data as soon as the tool is working again.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-light version focusing on macro context, and general sentiment implications (without daily Reddit data), and then append the full social sentiment section once the tool is back online.
- I can retry fetching the Reddit data in a moment, or we can switch to an alternative data source if you approve (though I currently don’t have another tool hooked up for social sentiment).

Proposed approach for the full report (once data is available)
- Objective: Analyze SPY’s current state through social media sentiment (Reddit), recent company/news sentiment, and implications for traders.
- Data sources (to be leveraged when tool is available): Reddit sentiment by day, notable Reddit posts, aggregate sentiment scores, recent news headlines related to SPY and the S&P 500, macro news, and any notable ETF flows or related indicators (e.g., VIX, SPY price action, volume).
- Key outputs:
  - Daily sentiment breakdown (bullish, bearish, neutral) by date.
  - Top themes driving sentiment each day (e.g., macro data, earnings expectations, Fed policy, geopolitical risks).
  - Notable posts or threads with sentiment tone and potential impact.
  - Correlation/context with price action, volatility (VIX), and major news.
  - Trading implications and risk considerations for SPY (short-term and swing perspectives).

Data gaps and fallback
- If Reddit data remains unavailable, I’ll deliver a thorough qualitative analysis based on:
  - Recent macro/Narrative themes around SPY and the S&P 500.
  - How sentiment generally shifts around macro data releases (inflation, growth, Fed commentary) and earnings seasons.
  - Publicly reported sentiment indicators (where available) and notable market news headlines.

Request for next steps
- Would you like me to:
  1) Retry pulling the Reddit data now, hoping the tool comes back online, or
  2) Proceed with a sentiment-focused draft that foregrounds macro/news sentiment and qualitative implications, with a placeholder section for Reddit sentiment to be filled once data is available?

If you want a draft now, I can provide a concise, traders-focused note that describes the likely sentiment drivers and actionable implications for SPY, plus a Markdown-ready table skeleton for you to fill in once data arrives. In the meantime, here’s a Markdown table skeleton you can paste into the final report to organize key points (to be populated with actual data later):

| Date | Daily Sentiment (Bullish / Bearish / Neutral) | Daily Post Volume | Top Themes Driving Sentiment | Notable Reddit Post Snapshot | Related News Headlines | Price Action Context (Spy) | Trading Implications / Risk | Notes |
|------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|------|
| 2025-09-15 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| 2025-09-13 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| 2025-09-11 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2025-09-10 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2025-09-09 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If you prefer, I can also draft a short executive summary now highlighting likely sentiment drivers and potential implications for SPY, with explicit placeholders for the day-by-day Reddit sentiment once the data tool is operational again.
