Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch AMD data and compute the indicators, but the data source returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError) for get_YFin_data and the parallel stockstats calls also failed. I can still provide a solid, action-oriented framework using the most relevant, non-redundant indicators for AMD given the current market context, and I’ll flag what to look for once the data fetch is working again.

Selected indicators (8) and why they’re suitable for AMD
1) close_50_sma
- Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why for AMD: AMD tends to exhibit multi-quarter trend cycles tied to data-center demand and GPU cycles. The 50SMA helps filter noise while aligning with mid-term trend turns.

2) close_200_sma
- Purpose: Long-term trend confirmation; golden/death cross context.
- Why for AMD: When AMD is above the 200SMA, it’s generally in a broader uptrend (or recovering from a pullback); below suggests a bear market or extended consolidation. Useful for larger-position bias alignment.

3) close_10_ema
- Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum.
- Why for AMD: Captures quick shifts in sentiment around earnings cycles, AI demand news, or competitive updates. Useful for timing entries when used with longer-term averages.

4) macd
- Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals via differences of EMAs.
- Why for AMD: MACD crossovers (MACD crossing above zero or above MACDS) add evidence of a shift in momentum, especially around AI/data-center news or supply/demand updates.

5) macds
- Purpose: MACD signal line smoothing; crossovers with MACD define trade signals.
- Why for AMD: When MACD crosses MACDS, it reinforces or weakens the momentum signal. Helps filter false positives from MACD alone.

6) rsi
- Purpose: Momentum with overbought/oversold context.
- Why for AMD: RSI can flag potential reversals around key levels, e.g., near 70 (overbought in an uptrend) or near 30 (oversold in a downtrend). Divergences can precede reversals in cyclical semiconductor stocks.

7) boll_ub
- Purpose: Upper Bollinger band as a breakout/overbought proxy.
- Why for AMD: Breakouts above the upper band often accompany strong upside moves, but can also indicate overextension. Use with other indicators to confirm.

8) boll_lb
- Purpose: Lower Bollinger band as a potential support/bottom-reversal proxy.
- Why for AMD: Touching or crossing the lower band can signal oversold conditions or a potential reversal in a pullback. Helpful when used with trend indicators and momentum.

What to look for once data is available (qualitative guide)
- Trend alignment: Look for alignment across 50SMA, 200SMA, and 10EMA.
  - Bullish setup: Price above 200SMA and 50SMA, price above 10EMA, MACD positive with rising histogram, RSI in a broad uptrend (not extremely overbought), and price trading near or above boll_ub in a breakout context.
  - Bearish setup: Price below 200SMA and 50SMA, price below 10EMA, MACD negative with falling histogram, RSI drifting toward or below 40, and price touching or riding boll_lb.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and MACDS should corroborate the direction suggested by price action; a bullish MACD cross with a positive histogram strengthens a long setup, while a bearish cross supports a short view.
- Volatility context: Boll upper and lower bands help gauge breakout vs. mean-reversion potential. If bands expand and price closes above boll_ub with MACD positive, that’s a higher-probability breakout signal; if bands contract, expect consolidation.
- Reversion risk: RSI readings near extremes (above 70 or below 30) warrant caution or require confirmation from trend indicators to avoid chasing reversals in strong trends.

Nuanced AMD context (as of mid-2025)
- The stock often trades with AI/data-center news cycles and GPU product news. If AMD is benefiting from data-center GPU demand and markets/users are rotating capital into AI accelerators, AMD may trade with elevated momentum but also with higher volatility.
- The semiconductor space can swing on earnings guidance, supply chain updates, foundry/processing efficiency, and competition dynamics with peers. Trend-following indicators (50SMA, 200SMA) help distinguish durable moves from counter-trend bounces.
- Volume-confirmation (VWMA) would be highly useful to add once data is retrievable, but the eight indicators chosen emphasize trend, momentum, and volatility, which are especially informative during earnings-driven moves or AI cycle shifts.

Suggested practical actions (high-level ideas)
- In a bullish signal cluster (price above long-term averages, MACD positive, RSI not stretched, and price near/above boll_ub), consider patiently adding or increasing exposure on pullbacks toward the 50SMA or 10EMA, with tight risk controls informed by ATR (if you add ATR later).
- In mixed or uncertain conditions (band tightening, MACD flattening, RSI around mid-range), prefer waiting for clearer confirmations rather than chasing trades.
- In bearish setups (price below 200SMA, MACD negative, RSI weak), manage downside risk and consider hedging or reduced exposure until a reversal pattern emerges.

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma     | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above → bullish mid-term trend; price below → risk of pullback or consolidation       | Look for pullbacks to 50SMA as potential entries in uptrends; use with other signals |

| close_10_ema     | Short-term momentum                          | Quick shifts; sensitive to news/earnings                                                 | Use for timing entries around confirmations from 50SMA/200SMA and MACD |
| macd             | Momentum and trend-change signals              | Positive MACD and rising histogram → bullish momentum; negative/declining → bearish momentum | Favor long when MACD confirms with MACDS; consider exits if divergence appears |
| macds            | MACD signal line smoothing                       | Cross of MACD above/below MACDS strengthens/reduces momentum signal                       | Use crossovers as filters alongside MACD and price trend |
| rsi              | Momentum, overbought/oversold context           | RSI above 70 indicates potential pullback; below 30 indicates oversold conditions            | Watch for reversals or divergences; confirm with trend indicators |
| boll_ub           | Upper breakout/overbought proxy                 | Break above upper band can signal strong up moves; may indicate overbought in extended runs  | Confirm with MACD and price trend before acting on breakouts |
| boll_lb           | Lower band support/oversold proxy               | Touching lower band signals potential reversal or oversold conditions                         | Use with trend indicators to time reversals or bounce plays |

Next steps
- I’ll retry data retrieval as soon as the data source is available, and then run the 8 selected indicators for AMD with the current date (2025-09-15) to provide a data-driven, fine-grained interpretation.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a slightly different set (e.g., swap boll_ub/boll_lb for atr to add volatility and risk-adjusted sizing) or add vwma for volume context once data retrieval works.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer I proceed with a purely qualitative AMD analysis using the framework above until the data tool is back online?
