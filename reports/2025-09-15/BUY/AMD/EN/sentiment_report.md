Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch AMD Reddit stock data for 2025-09-15, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool error). It looks like the data source or path the tool expects isn’t available right now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can immediately retry fetching the Reddit data for AMD on 2025-09-15 and then continue with the full long-form report (sent as soon as I have the data).
- Proceed without Reddit data: I can deliver a detailed AMD sentiment and news analysis using other sources and a robust methodology, plus a Markdown table at the end. This would be a best-effort report focusing on recent headlines, general sentiment signals, and implications for traders, with clear caveats about data gaps due to the tool issue.
- Hybrid approach: I can start with a qualitative analysis now (news headlines, macro context, known AMD developments), and then slot in the Reddit data as soon as the tool is working again.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry immediately, I’ll do so and then produce the full long-form report with a concluding Markdown table.
