Recommendation: Buy (phased entry with strict risk controls)

Rationale recap
- Long-term thesis supported: Alphabet’s AI-enabled monetization across ads, YouTube, Cloud, and platform services provides multiple growth engines and operating leverage over time.
- Diversified revenue base lowers cyclicality risk, offering a more resilient earnings trajectory even if near-term ad cycles soften.
- Strong balance sheet enables buybacks and strategic investments, adding optionality to the valuation.
- Near-term headwinds (AI capex, ad-cycle risk, regulatory scrutiny) are manageable with disciplined risk controls and staged deployment.

Execution plan (phased entry)
Stage 1 (today)
- Initiate with 25–30% of the planned full position to establish exposure without chasing strength.
- Stop: use a price-based stop (e.g., close below the entry price by a defined percentage) or an ATR-based trailing stop starting from the initial trade.
- Hedge option: consider a protective long-dated put or a put spread to cap downside while preserving upside.

Stage 2 (on confirmation)
- Add 40–50% of the planned full position when price action confirms uptrend (e.g., price holds above key moving averages with expanding volume, and a bullish momentum signal such as a MACD cross).
- Maintain a trailing stop rule (advance stops to lock in gains as price rises).

Stage 3 (full position)
- Complete the remaining 20–25% on a decisive breakout above a multi-week resistance with broad participation or upon a meaningful AI-milestone-related catalyst.
- Maintain risk controls and hedge as needed to protect against a sharp downside spike.

Risk controls and hedges
- Portfolio risk: target 4–8% of the equity sleeve allocated to GOOGL, adjusted for your risk tolerance.
- Stops: ATR-based trailing stops (e.g., 1.2–1.5x ATR) and price-based stops (e.g., close below the 200-day moving average or a set drawdown from entry).
- Provide downside protection: buy long-dated puts or implement a put spread (6–12 months out) to cap risk while preserving upside.
- Position sizing: layer into the name to avoid over-concentration; scale into favorable signals rather than fear-driven moves.

Catalysts and monitoring
- Track AI monetization milestones (new ad formats, shopping integrations, enterprise AI tools) and cloud margin trajectory.
- Monitor regulatory headlines and Alphabet’s responses; adjust exposure if risk increases.
- Watch ad spend trends, YouTube monetization versus platform investment, and any signs of cloud margin recovery.

Data-driven follow-up plan (when data resumes)
- Re-run the 8-indicator framework (200SMA, 50SMA, 10EMA, MACD family, RSI, ATR) to confirm trend/momentum with time-stamped signals.
- Attach precise observations to entry/exit decisions (e.g., price above major moving averages with bullish MACD cross, non-extreme RSI, sustainable ATR regime).
- Maintain a bear-watchlist for risk-off scenarios (AI capex persistence, ad-cycle weakness, regulatory developments) and tighten stops if risks materialize.

Lessons applied
- Don’t rely on hype; anchor decisions to monetization milestones and margin trajectories.
- Value diversification and optionality from Ads/YouTube/Cloud as ballast in tougher periods.
- Use disciplined risk planning, hedging, and staged deployment to manage drawdown risk and maximize upside.

Bottom line
- Buy: Alphabet offers the strongest multi‑year upside in this setup, supported by AI-enabled monetization, a durable moat, and solid cash generation. Near-term headwinds exist but are addressable with staged entry, risk controls, and hedging. If AI monetization strengthens and cloud margins improve, the multi-year upside remains compelling.
