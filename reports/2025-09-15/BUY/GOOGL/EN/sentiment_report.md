I ran into an internal tool error while trying to fetch Reddit/social sentiment data for GOOGL on 2025-09-15. The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError, which is not due to your input. I can proceed in a few ways:

What I can do next
- Retry immediately: I can attempt the Reddit sentiment fetch again to pull the latest posts/news for the same date.
- Proceed with a qualitative, non-tool-backed analysis: I can deliver a detailed, trader-focused analysis using publicly known themes (AI momentum, ad market, Google Cloud, regulatory risk, etc.) and outline sentiment and news implications without the tool’s data.
- Use alternate data sources: If you have access to other sentiment feeds or APIs, I can incorporate them; otherwise I can rely on a high-level synthesis of recent public news and typical sentiment drivers for Alphabet (GOOGL).

What I will deliver once data is available (or if you approve a non-tool approach)
- A comprehensive long-form report analyzing social media sentiment and public news about Alphabet (GOOGL) over the past week, with day-by-day sentiment trends, notable influencers or threads, and how sentiment aligns with price/volume moves.
- Key takeaways on catalysts (AI product updates, ad ecosystem dynamics, cloud growth, regulatory/regulatory risk, earnings expectations) and how traders might position around them.
- A fine-grained set of insights and implications for traders, including potential bullish/bearish scenarios, risks, and watch-outs.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing:

  - Theme (e.g., AI/Product momentum, Regulation, Ad/Monetization, Cloud)
  - Sentiment signal (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and intensity
  - Notable news items or posts driving the signal
  - Potential price/volatility implications
  - Suggested trading stance (Bullish/Bearish/Hold) under different scenarios

Please choose one:
1) I retry the Reddit sentiment fetch now.
2) I proceed with a high-detail, non-tool-backed analysis and provide the full report framework with a post-week sentiment interpretation (no live data, but structured insights).
3) You provide an alternative data source or date, and I adapt the analysis accordingly.

If you’d like me to proceed with option 1 (retry), I’ll give it another go immediately and then deliver the full report with data-filled insights once the tool responds.
