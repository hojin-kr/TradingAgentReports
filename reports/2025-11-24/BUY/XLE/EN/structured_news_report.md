# Daily Trading Intelligence: XLE

## Executive Snapshot
The energy sector, as represented by the XLE index, has been bucking the trend, gaining 3.5% over the past week driven by stronger-than-expected oil prices.

## Macro Backdrop
A volatile S&P 500 index and a weak NASDAQ composite are indicative of market uncertainty, while a revised September GDP reading that beats expectations suggests neutral news on economic growth. However, US-China tensions escalate with new tariffs imposed, potentially leading to trade-related market fluctuations.
