Based on the news from EODHD, finnhub, and reddit, here's a comprehensive report of the current state of the world that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Market Trends:**

The S&P 500 Index (QQQ) has been experiencing a mixed trend over the past week. On November 18th, the index dropped by 2.5% due to concerns about the US economy's ability to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, since then, the index has recovered partially and is currently trading at a 0.5% gain.

**Economic Indicators:**

The US Labor Department reported that the number of initial unemployment claims decreased by 25,000 to 6.57 million for the week ending November 18th. This indicates a slowdown in layoffs and a possible improvement in the labor market. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is still casting a shadow over the global economy.

**Geopolitical Developments:**

The situation in Ukraine remains volatile, with Russia continuing to attack Ukrainian cities. The US and its allies have condemned these actions and imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities. The situation has led to increased tensions between the US and Russia, which could impact global trade and investment.

**Central Bank Decisions:**

The Federal Reserve announced that it would keep interest rates unchanged for the time being, citing concerns about inflation. However, the Fed also signaled that it was prepared to raise rates if necessary to control inflation.

**Macroeconomic Outlook:**

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded its global growth forecast due to rising tensions in Ukraine and other geopolitical conflicts. The IMF now expects global growth to slow to 3.4% in 2025, down from 3.6% previously.
