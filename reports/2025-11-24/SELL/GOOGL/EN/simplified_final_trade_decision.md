# Investment Report: GOOGL
## Executive Summary
GOOGL's declining search engine market share and reliance on a single product pose significant risks, outweighing the benefits of its strong brand and loyal user base.

## Investment Decision
SELL

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
Declining search engine market share and reliance on a single product (search advertising) create uncertainty. Google's commitment to data privacy and security is questionable, adding to concerns. While the company has a strong brand and loyal user base, these strengths are not enough to outweigh the significant risks.

## Risks To Watch
* Decline in search engine market share
* Reliance on a single product (search advertising)
* Questionable commitment to data privacy and security
* Risk of over-expansion in cloud computing services
