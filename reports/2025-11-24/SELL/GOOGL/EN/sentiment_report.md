After acquiring the data from Reddit, I analyzed the posts and comments to understand public sentiment towards GOOGL. The overall sentiment was mixed, with some users expressing optimism about the company's future growth, while others were concerned about the increasing competition in the tech industry.

One of the most common topics discussed on Reddit was Google's recent acquisition of a new technology firm. Some users expressed excitement about the potential opportunities for innovation and growth, while others raised concerns about the impact on employee morale and the risk of over-expansion.

Sentiment analysis tools revealed that the majority of posts with positive sentiment were from users who were excited about Google's latest product releases, such as its new line of smart home devices. These users praised the company's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.

On the other hand, posts with negative sentiment were often related to issues such as data privacy and security concerns. Some users expressed frustration with the company's handling of user data and called for greater transparency and accountability.

I also analyzed recent company news to understand any significant developments that may have affected public perception. One notable story involved Google's announcement of a major investment in renewable energy initiatives, which was met with widespread praise from environmentalists and investors alike.

However, another recent news story highlighted the company's decision to lay off several hundred employees, which sparked concerns about job security and corporate governance.
