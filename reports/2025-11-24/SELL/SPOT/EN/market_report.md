## FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY/HOLD/SELL

Based on the provided historical data of SPOT's 50-day Simple Moving Average (close_50_sma), we can observe the following trends and insights:

### Trend Analysis
The close_50_sma values from November 9th to November 23rd are not available as it was a weekend or holiday. However, from November 21st onwards, the closing price is increasing steadily, indicating an uptrend.

### Support and Resistance
As the closing prices approach the close_50_sma value, we can identify potential support and resistance levels. For instance, on November 24th (after the trading day), the value would have been around 670.17. If the price were to bounce back from this level, it could be considered a support level.

### Comparison with Other Indicators
To confirm the trend direction and identify golden or death cross setups, we can compare the close_50_sma values with other indicators such as the 200-day Simple Moving Average (close_200_sma) and the MACD line. However, without access to real-time data or additional historical data, we cannot make any definitive conclusions.

### Recommendation
Based on the available data and analysis, our recommendation is to hold onto SPOT's shares for now, as the uptrend continues and the close_50_sma values are increasing steadily.
