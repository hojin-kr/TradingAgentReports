## Final Transaction Proposal:
### **BUY/HOLD/SELL**: HOLD

**Reasoning:** 
The MACD line is above the signal line, which indicates that the stock has entered a bullish phase. This could be an opportunity for investors who believe in AMD's long-term growth potential.

However, we should note that this strategy may not work for all traders as it relies on the investor's timing and knowledge of how to manage risk.
