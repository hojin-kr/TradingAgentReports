# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD's stock has impressive growth potential, but its limitations and risks outweigh its strengths. The company's dependence on Google and lack of transparency around financials are significant concerns.

## Investment Decision
Sell AMD's Stock

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Dependence on a single major customer (Google) increases risk.
- Lack of transparency around financials makes it difficult to assess the company's true health.
- Limited market share compared to competitors like Intel and NVIDIA.

## Risks To Watch
- Google switching to a different vendor, potentially disrupting AMD's business.
- Increased competition from emerging technologies like AI and 5G.
- Volatility in the tech industry due to rapid changes in consumer demand.
