Based on the comprehensive analysis of AMD's investment plan, I have thoroughly evaluated the pros and cons of investing in the company. After careful consideration, I concur with the recommendation to sell AMD's stock due to its limitations and risks.

The concerns about AMD's dependence on Google as a major customer, lack of transparency around financials, and limited market share are well-reasoned and warrant a cautious approach. While the company has made impressive strides in recent years, its growth potential is not without its challenges.

Furthermore, I agree that diversifying into other stocks with stronger fundamentals and less risk associated with competition and market volatility is a prudent decision. By spreading investments across various asset classes, investors can minimize their exposure to potential losses and increase their overall portfolio resilience.

However, it's essential to note that the market can be unpredictable, and unexpected events may occur. In such cases, being prepared to adjust investment decisions based on new information is crucial.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that selling AMD's stock is the best course of action at this time. By doing so, investors can avoid potential losses and wait for a more favorable opportunity to invest in the company.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
