## Final Transaction Proposal: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the analysis of the 50 SMA and MACD values, I propose a buy/sell strategy for AMZN.

### Key Observations:

1. The 50 SMA has been trending downward over the past week, indicating a bearish trend.
2. The MACD line has been crossing below the signal line, indicating a bearish crossover.

### Trading Strategy:

Given the current market conditions and technical analysis, I recommend **BUYING** AMZN on the next trading day after this report is published (i.e., November 25, 2025).

### Rationale:

The 50 SMA's downward trend and the MACD line's bearish crossover suggest a potential buying opportunity. The MACD histogram indicates a significant gap between the MACD line and its signal, which may indicate a strong downward momentum. However, it is essential to consider other factors such as volume analysis, news events, and global market trends before making a final trading decision.

### Additional Considerations:

1. Volume Analysis: Check for any unusual volume spikes or dips that might confirm the trend.
2. News Events: Monitor any significant news announcements that could impact AMZN's stock price.
3. Global Market Trends: Keep an eye on overall market trends and adjust the strategy accordingly.

### Risk Management:

To minimize risk, consider setting a stop-loss order at a reasonable distance below the current price (e.g., 10-15% of the current price). This will help limit potential losses if the trend reverses.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, I recommend **BUYING** AMZN with caution and monitoring the situation closely. Remember to stay informed about market developments and adjust the strategy as needed.
