FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the provided historical data, here is a detailed analysis of the trends observed:

The 200 SMA values from 2025-11-09 to 2025-11-24 show an overall increasing trend, indicating a bullish market sentiment. The 10 EMA values also exhibit an upward trend, suggesting that the short-term momentum is in favor of the buyers.

However, the MACD values from 2025-11-09 to 2025-11-24 display a negative signal on 2025-11-21 and -22, indicating a potential bearish divergence. The MACD line has crossed below the MACDs, suggesting that the short-term momentum is weakening.

Considering these trends, it appears that the overall market sentiment is slightly bullish, but with a warning sign of potential bearish divergence. A cautious approach would be to hold or buy with a stop-loss order at the lower band (boll_lb).

**Recommendation:**

* Hold current position.
* Consider buying with a stop-loss order at 543.9386576365987 (10 EMA) and adjusting the stop-loss level as the price moves in favor of buyers.
