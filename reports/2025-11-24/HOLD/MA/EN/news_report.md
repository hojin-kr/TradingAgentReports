**Economic Indicators:**

The latest GDP data from the US showed a stronger-than-expected growth rate of 2.5%, with some analysts attributing this to the ongoing labor market momentum and increased consumer spending.

The decision has also led to a strengthening of the US dollar against major currencies.
