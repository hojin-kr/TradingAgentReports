## FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY/HOLD/SELL

Based on the provided data, we can observe the following trends and insights:

**Closing Price Trend:**
The closing price has been increasing steadily over the past few days, indicating a bullish trend.

**Bollinger Bands:**
The Bollinger Middle line has been trending upwards, and the upper band has been touching the highs, while the lower band has been touching the lows. This suggests that the price is likely to break out of the upper band and test its resistance level.

**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**
The RSI has been in oversold territory for most of the past few days, indicating a potential buying opportunity. However, it's essential to monitor the RSI and wait for a divergence before entering a long position.

**Moving Averages:**
The 50-day SMA has been trending upwards, while the 200-day SMA remains relatively stable. This suggests that the short-term trend is still bullish, but the longer-term trend is more neutral.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following trading strategy:

1. **Buy:** Enter a long position when the RSI falls below 30 and the closing price touches the lower band of the Bollinger Bands.
2. **Hold:** Continue holding the position while the RSI remains in oversold territory and the closing price continues to trend upwards.
3. **Sell:** Exit the position when the RSI rises above 70 or the closing price breaks through the upper band of the Bollinger Bands.

Please note that this is a general trading strategy and should be adjusted according to individual risk tolerance and market conditions.
