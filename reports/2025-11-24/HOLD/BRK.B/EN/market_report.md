FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the indicators analyzed, it appears that BRK.B has been trending in an upward direction over the past few months. The 50 SMA (short-term moving average) has been increasing steadily, indicating a bullish trend.

However, the RSI values are still below 70, suggesting that the stock is not yet overbought. A reading above 70 would indicate that the stock is due for a correction.

Given this analysis, I would propose the following transaction:

* Transaction type: Buy
* Time frame: Long-term (more than 3 months)
* Stop-loss level: 5% below the current price
* Take-profit target: 10% above the current price

Please note that this is just a recommendation and should not be taken as investment advice. It's always best to consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
