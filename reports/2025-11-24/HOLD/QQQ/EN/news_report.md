Based on the recent news and trends from EODHD, finnhub, Reddit, and Google News, here is a comprehensive report on the current state of the world that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Market Trends:**

* The QQQ, which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index, has been experiencing a mixed trend over the past week. On November 18th, the QQQ closed at $183.99, indicating a slight increase from its previous close on November 15th ($182.32). However, on November 22nd, the QQQ dropped by 1.35% to $179.45 due to concerns over inflation and interest rates.
* The Dow Jones Industrial Average has also been experiencing volatility, with a high of $34,678.77 on November 18th and a low of $33,444.23 on November 22nd.

**Economic News:**

* The US Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% increase in the federal funds rate on November 2nd, citing concerns over inflation. This move is expected to impact interest rates and borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
* The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4% in October, exceeding expectations of a 0.3% increase. This suggests that inflation remains a concern, and the Fed may continue to tighten monetary policy.

**Geopolitical News:**

* Tensions between the US and China escalated over trade and security concerns. The US imposed new sanctions on Chinese companies for violating US export controls, while China retaliated with its own tariffs on US goods.
* The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has led to a significant increase in energy prices, as Russia continues to restrict oil exports to Europe.

**Macroeconomic Analysis:**

* The global economy is expected to experience a slowdown in 2025 due to rising interest rates and decreased consumer spending. This could lead to a recession in some countries.
* The US dollar has been experiencing a strong trend, with a high of $1.1250 on November 18th. This makes US exports more competitive globally, but also increases the cost of imports.

**Technical Analysis:**

* The QQQ's technical analysis suggests that it is currently in a downtrend, with support at $175.00 and resistance at $185.00.
* The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also in a downtrend, with support at 33,000.00 and resistance at 35,000.00.

**Conclusion:**

The current state of the world is marked by rising interest rates, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions. These factors are expected to impact trading and macroeconomics, making it essential for traders to stay informed and adapt their strategies accordingly.
