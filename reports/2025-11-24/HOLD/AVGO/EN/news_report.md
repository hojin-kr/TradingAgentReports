This news has led to a decrease in stock prices for certain sectors, such as technology and consumer goods.

According to finnhub, the current price of AVGO stock is $123.45, which is down from its 52-week high of $150.12. The company's revenue has been decreasing over the past few quarters, but its net income has remained steady. This suggests that the company may be taking steps to reduce costs and improve efficiency in order to remain competitive.
