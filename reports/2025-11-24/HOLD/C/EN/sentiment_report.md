* On November 20, 2025, CIncnf announced a partnership with a leading technology firm, which is expected to enhance its product offerings and expand its customer base.
* On November 18, 2025, CIncnf reported a slight increase in revenue compared to the same period last year, but the company expressed concerns about the impact of global economic uncertainty on its future growth.
