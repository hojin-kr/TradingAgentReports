Thanks for the trigger. Quick status update:

- The Reddit stock info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError when I try to fetch SPY Reddit data. I can’t access Reddit-based sentiment/news for SPY right now.

How would you like to proceed? I can do one of the following:

Option A — Retry now or later
- I can re-run the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available again and then produce the full long report with day-by-day sentiment, Reddit threads, and related news.

Option B — Proceed with a best-effort qualitative framework (no Reddit data)
- I can deliver a comprehensive SPY analysis using other public sentiment signals and general market news (e.g., major headlines, fund flows, macro events, volatility signals) and structure it for traders without the Reddit-specific data. This will still be detailed and trader-focused, with a Markdown table at the end.

Option C — You specify sources or dates
- If you have specific dates, subreddits, or alternative data sources you want me to include, share them and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.

If you want me to proceed with Option B now, here’s what I’ll include (and I’ll still produce a Markdown table at the end):

What the upcoming long report will cover (without Reddit-specific data)
- Broad sentiment snapshot: overall tone in major channels (Twitter/X, StockTwits, finance news comments) around SPY over the past week, with day-by-day breakdown if available.
- News highlights: key macro/news catalysts affecting SPY (economic data, Fed commentary, geopolitical events, sector rotation Shifts).
- Market context: price action, notable moves in SPY components, VIX levels, breadth, and volume signals that traders watch for short-term moves.
- Flow signals: fund inflows/outflows, ETF trading volumes, options activity if accessible.
- Risk and scenario analysis: what headlines could imply for support/resistance, trending vs. mean-reverting behavior, and potential catalysts in the next week.
- Trader implications: actionable takeaways, potential entry/exit ideas, risk management notes.

Proposed Markdown table (structure only)
- Section: Aspect
- Section: Key Points
- Section: Sentiment Indicator (range or descriptor)
- Section: Data Source
- Section: Timeframe

If you’d like Option A or C, tell me the preference and I’ll proceed accordingly. If you want me to just retry the Reddit data fetch now, I can do that and weave in the results as soon as the tool responds.
