# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD has strong long-run growth in data-center chips and software, but near-term pressure from Nvidia and AI-capex volatility creates caution. A hedged-long stance aims to limit losses while keeping upside potential if catalysts hit.

## Investment Decision
Hold AMD with a disciplined hedged-long stance. Confidence: Moderate

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- What AMD does in simple terms: AMD designs computer chips for data centers and personal computers, plus software tools that help run AI and graphics workloads.

- Why the stock could rise (positive trends): Long-run strength from data-center demand, upcoming Zen 6 CPUs, MI accelerators, and continued growth in cross-stack software (ROCm, ROCm-based ecosystems). If AI and data-center momentum improves, AMD can gain share and margin traction.

- Why the stock could fall or stall (challenges): Near-term competition from Nvidia and volatility in AI-related spending. Execution risks around new product cycles (Zen 6, RDNA/UDNA) and any regulatory or policy changes that affect the tech sector.

- Why hedge instead of a binary bet: A hedged-long approach protects capital if challenges intensify while preserving exposure to upside if AMD executes on its longer-run roadmap. This aligns with a balanced view that values both downside control and upside potential.

- Risk management approach: Use a disciplined hedging framework to cap downside and keep participation in potential upside, rather than betting everything on a single near-term catalyst.

## Risks To Watch
- Nvidiaâ€™s lead in AI and ongoing AI capex cycles could limit near-term AMD upside.
- Execution risk on Zen 6, RDNA/UDNA, MI scaling, and ROCm traction.
- Regulatory and policy developments affecting technology suppliers.
- Macro and AI demand cycles that could impact enterprise spending.
- Competition and pricing pressure affecting margins and market share.
