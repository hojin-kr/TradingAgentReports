I’m unable to retrieve the AMD data right now due to a backend file-access error with the data fetch tool. I can still outline a robust, complementary set of indicators (up to 8) that would give you a well-rounded view once the data is available, and I’ll show you how to interpret them for AMD in a typical mid- to long-term trading context. If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval after this and then generate a detailed, data-driven report.

Selected indicators (8, non-redundant, complementary)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Medium-term trend orientation and a dynamic support/resistance level. Useful for confirming the primary trend direction when combined with shorter and longer horizons.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm whether you’re in a broader uptrend or downtrend. Signals like a golden cross (price/shorter MA above 200SMA) add conviction for trend-following decisions.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  Why: Captures short-term momentum shifts; reacts quickly to price changes. Useful for timing entries when aligned with longer-term trend signals.
- macd (MACD)
  Why: Momentum and trend-change signal via the MACD line cross with its signal. Helps identify potential trend reversals or accelerations when aligned with price action.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: Smoother trigger line for MACD crossovers; reduces false entries by requiring the MACD line to cross the signal line for entries/exits.
- rsi (Momentum)
  Why: Measures relative strength and momentum; overbought/oversold levels (e.g., 70/30) help spot potential reversals, but should be interpreted in the context of the prevailing trend.
- atr (Volatility)
  Why: Measures market volatility; informs position sizing and stop placement. Higher ATR suggests wider stops; lower ATR indicates tighter risk controls.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  Why: The 20-period moving average that centers Bollinger bands; helps gauge breakout potential and mean reversion dynamics when used with upper/lower bands for confirmation.

Rationale for these choices in AMD’s context
- Trend and momentum blend: Using 50SMA, 200SMA, and 10EMA covers multi-timeframe trend direction (long, medium, and short). This helps filter entries in AMD’s volatile, sentiment-driven environment.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and its signal line give a shared momentum read, reducing false signals that can occur with a single oscillator.
- Price momentum alongside strength: RSI adds a momentum flavor to confirm overbought/oversold conditions, while MACD confirms trend momentum; together they reduce reliance on a single signal.
- Volatility awareness and risk management: ATR informs stops and position sizing in AMD, which can experience swift moves around earnings, AI-cycle news, or supply-demand shifts.
- Mean-reversion/breakout context: Bollinger Middle helps differentiate persistent trend from potential breakout or consolidation phases when used with the upper and lower bands (even though I’m not listing those bands as separate indicators here, Bollinger framework remains useful for interpretation once data is available).

How to interpret these indicators together for AMD (high-level guidance)
- Trend confirmation: If price is above the 50SMA and 200SMA, and the 10EMA is above the price or crossing upward, the odds favor continued upside in the near term, provided MACD is above its signal and RSI is not deeply overbought.
- Momentum alignment: Look for MACD crossovers in the direction of the trend (MACD crossing above its signal when price is above key moving averages). A simultaneous RSI reading that is rising but not in overbought territory strengthens the case.
- Reversals and downside risk: If price remains above the trend but MACD shows bearish divergence (price makes higher highs while MACD makes lower highs) and RSI starts turning down from a high level, consider risk controls or lighter positioning, especially if ATR is rising (indicating increased volatility and potential whipsaws).
- Volatility-aware entries: In periods of elevated ATR, use wider stops to avoid being stopped out by normal volatility. In calm periods (lower ATR), tighter risk controls are appropriate.
- Mean reversion vs breakout: If price interacts with the Bollinger Middle and approaches the upper band while MACD shows momentum, this could indicate a breakout attempt; conversely, touching the lower band with bearish momentum may signal a pullback rather than a deeper trend reversal—context from MACD and RSI helps confirm.

Next steps (recommended)
- I can retry fetching the AMD data with the exact date range you provided (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-06) and then generate a detailed, data-driven report that:
  - computes the indicators on the actual AMD price series
  - presents current values, recent crossovers/divergences, and interpretation
  - provides a structured, step-by-step trading plan (entry, stop, target) tailored to AMD
- If you’d prefer, I can also substitute VWMA for one of the indicators to add a volume-confirmation layer.

Appendix: Key points table
Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for AMD | Caveats
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Check if price is above 50SMA and use crossovers with 10EMA for entries; use 50SMA as a reference for trend feel | Lagging indicator; watch for whipsaws in choppy markets
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirm broad trend; look for alignment with 50SMA for stronger signals | Very slow to react; best for strategic context, not time-sensitive entries
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Use for timing entries in the context of longer-term trend | Noise in choppy markets; confirm with other indicators
- macd | MACD | Momentum and potential trend changes | Look for MACD line crossing above/below MACD signal; align with price action | Can give false positives in low-volatility regimes
- macds | MACD Signal | smoothed momentum signal | Use cross of MACD with MACD Signal to trigger entries/exits | Should be part of a broader strategy to avoid false positives
- rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold momentum levels | Watch for 70/30 reversals and divergence; use with trend context | In strong trends RSI can stay extreme for long periods
- atr | Volatility | Market volatility; stop placement and risk management | Increase/decrease stops based on ATR; set position sizes accordingly | Reactive, not predictive; use with a plan
- boll | Bollinger Middle | Center of the Bollinger framework; trend/mean-reversion context | Gauge breakout potential and mean reversion with bands | Interpret with upper/lower bands for breakouts; bands can ride a trend

If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now and then deliver a full, data-backed AMD report with concrete numbers and precise signals. Would you like me to attempt the data fetch again?
