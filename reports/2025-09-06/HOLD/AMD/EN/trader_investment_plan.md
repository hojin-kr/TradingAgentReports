Recommendation: SELL AMD now (or at minimum sharply reduce long exposure and add a defined-risk hedge).

Why this aligns with the given plan
- The bear case is reinforced by Nvidia’s dominant position, potential AI-capex softness, regulatory/geopolitical headwinds, and PC/gaming cyclicality, all of which can dampen near-term upside and pressure multiples.
- AMD’s long-run data-center AI thesis is credible, but near- to intermediate-term catalysts are uncertain enough to warrant risk-reduction tactics rather than further scaling exposure.
- Valuation appears sensitive to catalysts missing or timing shifts; the plan’s emphasis on hedging and disciplined risk controls remains prudent.

Actionable steps
1) Portfolio posture
- If you’re currently long AMD, trim exposure aggressively toward neutral. A reduction of 40-60% of existing long exposure is a reasonable starting point, especially ahead of any catalysts (earnings, roadmap milestones).
- If you’re flat or only lightly exposed, avoid adding new long exposure; instead, pursue hedges to monetize downside risk.

2) Defined-risk hedge (example structures)
- Use long puts or a bear put spread to express protection with capped risk.
- Practical structure: buy ATM or slightly ITM puts with a 6–12 month horizon to capture downside if catalysts disappoint; optionally sell a lower-strike put to finance part of the cost (bear put spread). This preserves meaningful upside protection while holding risk in check.
- Set a cap on total premium spent and ensure you’re not over-allocating to options relative to overall risk budget.

3) Risk controls and sizing
- Maintain a stop/stop-like discipline on any remaining long (e.g., a confluence level around key moving averages or a defined ATR-based level) to avoid oversized drawdowns.
- Keep AMD as a modest portion of overall risk capital; scale hedges to reflect macro risk and portfolio volatility.

4) Catalysts and reassessment
- Watch earnings timing, Zen 6/RDNA5 cadence, ROCm traction signals, hyperscaler AI spend, and any regulatory/export-control headlines.
- Reassess the position in 4–8 weeks or after a major catalyst. If AMD demonstrates durable data-center traction with improving margins and no new red flags, consider scaling back hedges and reassessing exposure.

5) Learnings incorporated
- Don’t rely on a single catalyst; use a scenario-based framework that weighs execution cadence, software adoption, and regulatory risk.
- Respect the Nvidia-dominance dynamic and PC/gaming cyclicality as meaningful near-term headwinds.
- Apply disciplined risk controls: hedges, capped premium, ATR-based sizing, and careful position sizing.

If you want, I can tailor specific hedge parameters (exact strikes, expirations, premium budgets) to your portfolio size and risk tolerance, and pull current price data to tighten entry/exit references. I can also switch to a more neutral or mixed stance if you prefer balancing risk differently.
