Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest AMD fundamentals (income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, insider sentiment, and insider transactions) for 2025-09-06, but the data retrieval hit a FileNotFoundError in the tool environment. Because of that, I don’t have the latest numbers to present yet.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval as soon as the data service/api environment is available again.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a qualitative, framework-driven fundamental analysis in the meantime, outlining what to look for and how traders might interpret the signals, and then plug in the actual figures as soon as the data tools respond.

What I can provide right now (framework-driven, no new data)
- Company profile and business model
  - AMD’s structure: compute/graphics segment (gaming, data center/server with EPYC, embedded) and any semi-custom revenues.
  - Key exposure to AI compute demand, data center expansion, and PC/gaming cycles.
  - Capital allocation stance: R&D intensity, capex for manufacturing/lead times, and any stock buyback/dividend activity.

- Core financial health (what to watch once data is back)
  - Revenue growth drivers: data center vs. client CPU/GPUs, and any semi-custom contributions.
  - Profitability: gross margin, operating margin, and net margin; note any mix benefits from data center or higher ASPs.
  - Cash flow quality: operating cash flow, free cash flow, and working capital dynamics (e.g., receivables/payables seasonality).
  - Balance sheet health: liquidity (cash, equivalents, credit facilities), debt levels, and capital structure.
  - Asset-light vs. asset-heavy considerations: Capex intensity, inventory turns, and R&D investment efficiency.

- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (when data is available)
  - Sentiment trend over the past 30 days: positive, negative, or mixed signals from corporate insiders.
  - Insider purchases or sales: magnitude and context (e.g., large purchases around key product milestones vs. opportunistic rebalancing).

- Historical trend context
  - Financial history over the last several quarters/years: revenue progression, margins, and cash flow conversion.
  - Major events affecting results: product launches, supply chain dynamics, AI demand cycles, and competitive landscape shifts.

- Trader-focused insights to look for once data is available
  - Revenue mix shifts: acceleration in data center vs. client segments and how that impacts gross/moperating margins.
  - Margin trajectory: whether gross margins are expanding due to product mix, scale, or pricing power; any sequential margin compression from inventory write-downs or supply chain constraints.
  - Cash flow signal: improving or deteriorating FCF yield; capital allocation efficiency (share repurchases vs. reinvestment).
  - Insider actions: any sustained insider buying or selling that aligns with or contradicts the reported fundamentals.
  - Risks to monitor: AI demand slowdown, PC market cyclicality, supply chain constraints, and competitive threats from Nvidia/Intel.

Proposed next steps
- I can retry the data pull immediately or on the next cadence you prefer. If you want, I can attempt again now and then deliver a full, data-driven fundamental report with a detailed, itemized analysis and a Markdown table at the end.
- Alternatively, if you’d like a provisional qualitative report right away (without the latest numeric data), I can deliver that too, clearly labeled as qualitative guidance pending the numeric figures.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry retrieving the latest AMD data now and then generate the full report with the accompanying Markdown table, or
2) Provide a qualitative, non-numeric AMD fundamental overview in the meantime? If you prefer, specify a focus (e.g., data center growth, margin trajectory, or insider signals) and I’ll tailor accordingly.
