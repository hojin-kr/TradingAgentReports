Sorry about that — the data fetch tool for Reddit stock news (get_reddit_stock_info) returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError). It looks like the AMD Reddit/news data feed is currently unavailable on my end. I don’t have another integrated data source ready in this session, so I can’t pull fresh social-media sentiment and news right this moment.

How would you like to proceed? Here are a few options:

- Option A: Retry now
  I can retry the Reddit data fetch for AMD on 2025-09-06 and report back with a refreshed sentiment snapshot and any headlines.

- Option B: Use alternate sources you specify
  If you have other sources you want me to pull from (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, Yahoo Finance news, company press releases), tell me which ones and I’ll synthesize a comprehensive sentiment/news view from those.

- Option C: Proceed with a best-effort AMD sentiment/news report (without live Reddit data)
  I’ll draft a thorough analysis based on general macro themes, typical AMD catalysts, and recent industry context (AI data-center demand, GPU expansion, competition with Nvidia/Intel, supply chain considerations) and clearly mark any data gaps. This will include a detailed trader-oriented interpretation and a Markdown table at the end.

- Option D: Wait and I’ll try again later
  I can hold and attempt to fetch the Reddit feed in a bit and then deliver the full report once data comes through.

If you’d like, I can start with Option C right away and provide:
- A structured long-form AMD social sentiment and news analysis (clearly labeled data gaps),
- Trader-oriented insights (catalysts, risks, and scenarios),
- A Markdown table summarizing key points at the end.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you choose Option C, I’ll proceed with a best-effort analysis and clearly note where data is missing due to the current tool outage.
