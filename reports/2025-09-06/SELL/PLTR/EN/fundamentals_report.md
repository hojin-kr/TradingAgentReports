Thanks. I can proceed, and here’s how I’ll structure the request unless you want to adjust anything:

Planned defaults for PLTR fundamentals (Aug 1, 2025 → Sep 6, 2025)
- Data window: August 1, 2025 through September 6, 2025 (inclusive)
- Sources: primary and credible sources such as Palantir’s filings (10-Q/10-K, 8-K), investor presentations, earnings calls, press releases, and reputable coverage. Insider activity will be pulled from SEC filings (Forms 4/13D/13G where available) and related disclosures; insider sentiment derived from reported transactions and notable statements.
- Fundamentals to include (as of the most recent date in the window and/or per period as available):
  - Income statement: revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS (GAAP and any adjusted if publicly reported)
  - Balance sheet: total assets, total liabilities, stockholders’ equity, liquidity indicators
  - Cash flow: cash flow from operations, free cash flow (if available), cash vs. debt metrics
  - Margins, growth: gross margin, operating margin, net margin; revenue growth (QoQ/YoY or TTM)
  - Valuation snapshots: P/E, P/S, P/B, debt/EBITDA or EV/EBITDA if available; cash/debt levels
  - Leverage and liquidity: total debt, cash and equivalents, working capital
  - Insiders: net buys/sells, notable insider transactions, sentiment signals
  - Historical context: notable year-over-year trends, notable one-time items or non-recurring impacts (as disclosed)
- Output format:
  - A comprehensive narrative report with sections (Profile, Fundamentals, Financial History, Insider Sentiment & Transactions, Catalysts/Risks, Conclusions)
  - A final Markdown table at the end summarizing key data points for quick reference
- Audience focus: Trader-oriented insights without overreliance on any single metric; keep numeric values in USD unless otherwise stated; note any data caveats (e.g., “as reported” vs. “adjusted”).
- Optional formatting: If you’d prefer CSV/Excel-ready data in addition to the narrative, I can provide that as a separate attachment or section.

What I need from you to proceed
- Confirm that the above defaults are acceptable.
- If you want a different window (start date, end date, or both), or different metrics (e.g., exclude certain non-GAAP items, include EBIT, EBITDAM, etc.), tell me now.
- Confirm output preference: plain text report with a Markdown appendix table (as requested), or also deliver a CSV/Excel file of the metrics.

If you’re happy with the defaults, I’ll fetch the data for PLTR and deliver the full report plus the Markdown summary table.
