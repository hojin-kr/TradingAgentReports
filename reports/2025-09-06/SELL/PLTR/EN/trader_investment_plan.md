Bottom line: Based on the provided analysis and current setup, the recommended action is to SELL Palantir (PLTR) now.

Key rationale (concise):
- Near-term technicals remain unfavorable: MACD negative, price trading below the 50-day moving average, with only tentative momentum recovery.
- Valuation and rate sensitivity: High multiple in a crowded AI/defense space leaves less cushion if growth slows or AI enthusiasm cools.
- Catalyst certainty risk: Army contract cadence and larger enterprise deployments are meaningful but not guaranteed in the near term; delays or slower uptake could trigger downside repricing.
- Execution and cadence risk: Cross-vertical expansion (Foundry/AIP) takes time; near-term results may be uneven, limiting visible upside.

What to do next (actionable plan):
- Immediate action: Exit PLTR or reduce to negligible exposure now. If you must keep a sliver, cap it at a very small percentage (e.g., 1–2%) with a strict exit plan.
- Rebalance capital: Redirect into more robust AI/defense exposure with clearer near-term catalysts and/or diversified AI exposure (ETFs/funds or names with improving near-term momentum and more attractive risk/reward).
- Risk controls: Use stop rules if you re-enter later (e.g., stop below the 50SMA with a momentum signal confirmation). Keep position sizing disciplined.
- Monitoring: Track near-term catalysts (cadence of government contracts, enterprise deployments) and look for multi-quarter visibility rather than pilots. Define explicit re-entry criteria if a durable momentum turn occurs (e.g., price reclaim of 50SMA with positive MACD and higher volume).

Lessons applied:
- Avoid reliance on a single indicator; confirm with multiple signals (price action, moving averages, momentum, and credible near-term catalysts).
- Prioritize capital preservation when near-term risk is elevated and catalysts are uncertain.
- Use valuation discipline; a high starting multiple requires robust near-term catalysts to sustain upside.

Final note: If you’d like, I can draft a quick one-page sell memo or outline a scenario-based re-entry plan with specific price targets for re-establishing exposure to the AI/defense theme.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
