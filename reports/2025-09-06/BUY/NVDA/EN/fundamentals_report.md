Thanks for the context. To proceed accurately, I need a few clarifications. If you don’t have a firm preference, I can default to reasonable choices and move forward with publicly available fundamentals and NVDA discussion data.

Proposed defaults (if you don’t specify otherwise)
- Platform/source for “Fundamental”: Public sources (e.g., company filings, Yahoo Finance/GAAP numbers, SEC filings) rather than a private tool. If you have a specific private platform, share a link or access details (or confirm you want me to use public sources only).
- Date window: August 6, 2025 through September 6, 2025 inclusive. If you prefer August 1, 2025 through September 6, 2025 inclusive, say the word.
- Metrics to include (with sources and timing):
  - Valuation: Trailing P/E, Forward P/E, P/S, Price/Cash Flow, EV/EBITDA
  - Balance/Liquidity: Debt/Equity
  - Cash and profitability: Free Cash Flow (FCF), FCF per share, Revenue, EBITDA, Net income
  - Timing: Use data as of each posting date if listing multiple posts, or provide a single snapshot (I can offer both options).
  - Note: I’ll label each metric as TTM/TTM-forward or forward estimates where applicable and cite sources (e.g., company filings, Yahoo Finance, consensus estimates).
- Output format: I can deliver a plain-text table and a Markdown-formatted table (and optionally CSV if you want to export to a spreadsheet).
- Handling multiple discussions:
  - Option A: One row per discussion/post within the window (with Date, Author, Post Title, Link, and a brief summary). Then a separate consolidated metrics section (latest or average across posts).
  - Option B: A single consolidated table aggregating metrics by metric type (not per post). I’ll ask you to pick which you prefer.
- Scope:
  - Include only NVDA discussions mentioning the ticker (NVDA) on the chosen platform. Exclude news articles; limit to discussion/forum-style posts unless you want broader sources included.
- Deliverable format and citations:
  - I will include source citations for each metric and post.
  - I’ll append a Markdown table at the end, organizing key points.

If you’d like, I can start with the defaults above and adjust after you confirm any changes. Please confirm:
1) Which date window should I use (Aug 6, 2025–Sep 6, 2025 or Aug 1, 2025–Sep 6, 2025)?
2) Do you want public sources only, or a Private/Fundamental platform (and provide access/details if private)?
3) Output preference for discussions: per-post rows or a consolidated metrics table?
4) The exact metrics to include (stick with the list above, or add/remove anything)?
5) Any other constraints (e.g., include insider sentiment/insider transactions as separate sections), or should I omit those for this pass?

Once you confirm, I’ll fetch the data and return a clean table with sources.
