Recommendation: Buy NVDA with disciplined entry and risk controls.

Rationale
- Durable AI data-center growth: NVDA’s CUDA ecosystem, software moat, and data-center demand from hyperscalers and enterprises imply earnings power beyond short-term price moves.
- Technical setup remains constructive: The bull case argues that near-term softness is a pause within an uptrend, with a confirmed rebound likely if momentum signals improve.
- Risk-reward favorable with disciplined triggers: Enter on a momentum-confirming re-acceleration rather than chasing a breakout, and use well-defined stops and phased sizing to manage drawdowns.

Two-entry pathways with safeguards

1) Primary entry path (momentum-confirmed buy)
- Trigger: NVDA reclaims 172–173 with a clean MACD cross turning positive and RSI trending above 40–45.
- Position sizing: Begin with 25–40% of the full target position on the trigger; add on subsequent confirmations if momentum holds.
- Stops: Place at 164–165 (near immediate support and ATR-based guardrail).
- Targets: First objective 185–190; if momentum sustains above 190, extend toward 210–230 as a longer-term target.
- Rationale: Captures the strongest, most durable upside while avoiding a chase of a false breakout.

2) Secondary/alternative path (disciplined dip-buy)
- Trigger range: Opportunistic buys in the 150–165 area on further dips.
- Position sizing: Layered entries, e.g., 25–30% of full position per tranche.
- Stops: Tight protection below 150 if macro risk remains elevated; otherwise consider a wider mental stop near 145–148 as a last resort.
- Targets: Base-case 185–210; upside potential 230–250 if AI capex trends re-accelerate and regulatory risk stays contained.
- Rationale: Allows participation in the secular AI cycle with a patient, risk-tolerant approach and hedging against deeper pullbacks.

Risk controls and monitoring
- Use ATR-based sizing (typical ATR ~4–5) so a one- or two-ATR move doesn’t overwhelm risk tolerances.
- Watch for consolidation in the mid-160s to low-170s; require MACD and RSI confirmations before adding or lifting stops.
- Consider hedges (protective puts or a small option hedge) if fully exposed.
- Review horizon: 2–6 weeks; reassess weekly if triggers fire, otherwise reevaluate thesis and consider trimming or reallocating.
- Diversification: Avoid over-concentration in one name; adjust other exposures to maintain portfolio risk parity.

Lessons applied
- Rely on multiple signals (price level, MACD, RSI) before committing capital.
- Treat near-term weakness as potential entry points, not reversals, unless momentum confirms.
- Scenario planning (base/bull/bear) informs risk management and exit paths.
- Proactively monitor regulatory and customer-concentration risks for timely adjustments.

Concise takeaway
- The strongest, durable argument remains Buy, with a disciplined, two-path entry and explicit risk controls to participate in NVDA’s multi-year AI data-center cycle.
