# Investment Report: META
## Executive Summary
META's long-run AI/data-center plan is credible, but near‑term capital needs, financing uncertainty, energy costs, and regulatory risk create meaningful downside. Hold today; upgrade to Buy only if a concrete bundle of catalysts proves durable.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Upgrade to Buy only if a near-term bundle of catalysts lands—favorably closed Hyperion financing terms, progress on Capex with improving unit economics, and regulatory developments that meaningfully boost monetization visibility. Confidence: Medium.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term headwinds weigh on margins: Mega-capex for Hyperion (~$30B) raises financing risk, currency exposure, and refinancing concerns; margins may stay tight in the near term.
- Regulatory and policy risk remains material: EU ad-targeting scrutiny and ongoing privacy rules could dampen monetization efficiency; questions around MRC accreditation add uncertainty.
- Energy and capex costs add pressure: Higher energy prices and potential cost overruns can erode profitability and delay margin uplift.
- Near-term earnings visibility is limited: Depreciation from heavy capex and regulatory drag can mask basic earnings improvements in the short run.
- Meaningful upside if catalysts land: When Hyperion financing and data-center ramps succeed, operating leverage could improve and monetization per user may rise.
- Long-run optionality exists but is not a near-term driver: AR/hardware, subsea cables, and other optionalities offer upside over time but are unlikely to lift cash flow quickly.

## Risks To Watch
- Financing terms or timing risk: If Hyperion financing becomes more expensive or delayed, near-term margins and capital returns could worsen.
- Capex milestones and unit economics: Slower-than-expected progress on El Paso and other data-center projects could keep unit costs high and delay profitability improvements.
- Regulatory trajectory: Stricter data rules or unfavorable rulings could curb monetization gains and ad targeting effectiveness.
- Energy/cost dynamics: Europe energy constraints or energy price volatility could raise operating costs.
- Currency and refinancing risk: Ongoing exposure could compress margins if exchange rates move unfavorably.
- AR/hardware monetization uncertainty: Consumer adoption and regulatory constraints could limit near-term upside from these initiatives.
