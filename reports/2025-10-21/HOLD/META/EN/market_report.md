Apologies — the data retrieval step failed. The get_YFin_data calls returned a FileNotFoundError, and the parallel runs for the stockstats indicators also encountered the same issue. That means I don’t have the actual META data (prices and indicator values) to generate the live report right now.

What I can do now
- Propose a robust, complementary set of indicators for META that would give a balanced view of trend, momentum, and volatility once data is available.
- Provide a detailed framework for the eventual report so you know exactly what will be produced when the data fetch works again.
- Offer to retry data retrieval immediately or switch to a manual data-provision workflow (e.g., you supply a CSV or I retry on a later tick).

Proposed indicator set (up to 8), with rationale for META
- close_50_sma
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why for META: Helpful to confirm the ongoing trend in a large-cap tech name where the price tends to respect key moving averages during earnings cycles and product launches.
- close_200_sma
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark and potential golden/death cross reference.
  - Why for META: Useful for strategic orientation (are we in a broad uptrend or not) and to contextualize shorter-term moves.
- close_10_ema
  - Role: Responsive short-term momentum indicator.
  - Why for META: Captures quick shifts around earnings or major product news; useful for timing when used with longer-term MA filters.
- macd
  - Role: Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line cross and divergence.
  - Why for META: Helps detect shifts in the leadership of the move, particularly around risk events.
- macds
  - Role: MACD signal line cross for trade triggers.
  - Why for META: Adds smoothing to confirm or question MACD-driven signals.
- macdh
  - Role: MACD histogram for momentum strength and divergence cues.
  - Why for META: Provides visible momentum acceleration/deceleration in conjunction with macd/macds.
- rsi
  - Role: Momentum with overbought/oversold context and potential divergences.
  - Why for META: In a growth/advertising-driven stock, RSI can help flag exhaustion or pullbacks when the trend is strong; use with trend filters to avoid false signals in strong trends.
- atr
  - Role: Volatility measure to guide risk management and position sizing.
  - Why for META: Meta often experiences volatility around earnings, product launches, or regulatory/antitrust news; ATR helps set dynamic stops and adapt risk.

What the eventual detailed report will cover (once data is available)
- Trend assessment
  - Alignment of price with 50_sma and 200_sma to determine the current trend direction (bullish, bearish, or range-bound).
  - Any crossovers where the price closes above/below the 50 and 200 SMAs, and implications for follow-on trades.
- Momentum analysis
  - MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram interaction with price action to identify momentum shifts.
  - RSI position relative to 30/70 thresholds and any divergences with price or MACD signals.
- Volatility and risk
  - ATR-driven volatility regime analysis to adjust stop-loss placement and position sizing.
  - Observations on price behavior near the Bollinger framework if relevant (not included in the 8-indicator set here to keep focus on the selected indicators).
- Contextual interpretation
  - How the combination of trend, momentum, and volatility signals cohere around recent META news (earnings, product updates, ad market dynamics, AI initiatives).
  - Potential setups (entry/exit zones) aligned with confluence of signals, and caution flags where signals diverge.
- Practical trading cues
  - Suggested timeframes for signals (e.g., daily for trend, 4-hour/1-hour for entries) once data is available.
  - Risk management notes (stop placement as a multiple of ATR, position-sizing guidelines).

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now or at a specified time. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry get_YFin_data for META with the same date range.
  - Try a shorter window (e.g., last 3–6 months) to quickly generate a usable set of indicators.
  - Accept a CSV or JSON file you provide containing price data, and compute the indicators from that data.
- Once data is available, I will generate:
  - A precise, data-driven narrative describing META’s trend, momentum, and volatility.
  - The 8-indicator-based insights with concrete interpretations.
  - A Markdown table summarizing key points and recommended actions.

Proposed indicator list (final recap)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Markdown table: key points to look for (once data is available)
| Indicator | Role | Signals to watch for META |
|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Price above 50_sma suggests bullish trend; cross below may indicate weakness or consolidation. Watch for test of dynamic support. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200_sma supports a long-term uptrend; price below 200_sma signals potential trend change or caution. Golden/death cross context when 50_sma crosses 200_sma. |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10_ema indicates near-term momentum shifts; use with longer-term MA for filtering. |
| macd | Momentum trend-change | MACD line crossing zero or diverging from price can signal trend changes; confirm with MACD histogram for momentum strength. |
| macds | MACD signal cross | Use MACD Signal line cross for potential entry/exit triggers; adds reliability when aligned with price action. |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction highlights acceleration or deceleration of momentum; watch for divergences with price. |
| rsi | Momentum with extremes | RSI overbought/oversold signals (e.g., >70 or <30); use divergences and trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends. |
| atr | Volatility risk management | Higher ATR indicates bigger price moves; use to size positions and place stops; adjust risk as volatility changes. |

If you want me to proceed, please tell me:
- Should I retry the data fetch now, or would you prefer a different data window or a manual data upload?
- Do you want me to proceed with the 8-indicator plan and generate the full report as soon as data becomes available?
