I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based sentiment data for META over the requested dates, but I’m hitting a FileNotFoundError with the Reddit data tool right now. I can’t retrieve the Reddit posts sentiment at the moment. I can either retry shortly or proceed using other sources to keep the analysis moving.

Here are your options:
- Option A: Retry now to pull Reddit sentiment data (I’ll run the same parallel requests again and report back with daily sentiment, volumes, and top themes).
- Option B: Proceed with a comprehensive long-form report using non-Reddit sources (official announcements, earnings, mainstream news coverage, and general social sentiment that’s publicly available) and clearly note the Reddit data gap. I’ll structure the analysis and keep it ready to augment with Reddit data as soon as the tool is working again.
- Option C: Do a hybrid approach: I draft the full report based on non-Reddit sources now, and I’ll plug in Reddit sentiment once the tool is back, with a clearly labeled update section.

If you’d like, I can start with Option B or C and deliver a thorough, trader-focused analysis now, then update with Reddit data in a follow-up. Let me know which option you prefer.

What I’ll deliver in a full long report (regardless of Reddit data status)
- Executive summary: Current state of META sentiment, notable news drivers, and implications for traders.
- Social sentiment landscape (non-Reddit) and public perception:
  - News sentiment from latest earnings, product launches (e.g., AI features, Threads), regulatory/regulatory-privacy developments, antitrust context, and market reactions.
  - Public sentiment themes (AI/machine learning adoption, ad business health, user growth on flagship apps, metaverse narrative, cost controls).
  - Any visible shifts in tone around key events (earnings, regulatory updates, platform changes).
- News digest (recent week): Summary of the most impactful headlines, their source credibility, and potential market impact.
- Key drivers and themes (granular, day-by-day when possible):
  - Advertising demand and pricing trends (pandemic-era comparisons, macro ads cycle, brand spend, travel/e-commerce correlations).
  - AI strategy and product execution (costs, hiring, data center investments, integration into ad stack and apps).
  - Platform dynamics (Reels/Instagram monetization, Facebook user engagement metrics, WhatsApp business adoption).
  - Regulatory and policy environment (privacy, antitrust risks, data use policies, cross-border issues).
  - Investor sentiment and earnings expectations (guidance, margin trajectory, capex vs. op-ex cadence).
- Sentiment metrics and interpretation:
  - Volume trends, polarity signals, and topic clustering (e.g., AI, ads performance, user growth, costs).
  - Short-term vs. longer-term sentiment implications for META stock.
- Trading implications and risk considerations:
  - When sentiment aligns with earnings guidance or macro signals, potential setups (breakouts, pullbacks).
  - Risks to watch (regulatory headwinds, ad-market downturns, competition from other platforms, execution risks in AI roadmap).
- Scenario analysis:
  - Bull case, base case, and bear case anchored to realistic catalysts (earnings beats/misses, AI product milestones, regulatory developments).
- Macro-aligned table (to be appended in Markdown as requested):
  - Date | Sentiment / Tone | Key News / Catalyst | Implication for META | Notes

Proposed Markdown table structure (to append at the end of the final report)
- Date
- Sentiment Tone (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
- Headline Drivers
- News/Events Summary
- Market Effect Desc (e.g., reaction in stock nuanced by volume)
- Potential Trading Implications
- Confidence/Notes

If you want me to proceed now with Option B or C, I’ll start synthesizing non-Reddit sources into a tight, trader-focused narrative and deliver the full long report, followed by a Reddit-driven update as soon as the tool is back online. Please tell me which option you prefer.
