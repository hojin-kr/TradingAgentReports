Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AMD data for the period 2024-10-21 to 2025-10-21, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a temporary data source issue rather than a user error. I can retry or adjust the data request, or proceed with a plan so we’re ready as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Proposed indicators (up to 8) for AMD, chosen for diverse, complementary insights:
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps identify medium-term trend context.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend confirmation; useful for major trend bias and cross-checks (golden/death cross context).
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. More responsive momentum signal; can help with timely entry/exit when used with longer-term filters.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum and potential trend-change signals via crossovers/divergence.
- macds: MACD Signal. Crossover with MACD line provides actionable trade signals within the broader momentum context.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum strength and overbought/oversold levels; look for divergences and trimming with trend context.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-SMA). A volatility-aware benchmark; helps identify consolidation vs. breakout tendencies when used with bands.
- atr: ATR. Volatility gauge to guide risk management, stop placement, and position sizing adaptive to current volatility.

Why this set is suitable now:
- The trio of moving averages (50SMA and 200SMA) anchors the mid- to long-term trend, while the 10EMA adds a sharp, short-term momentum filter.
- MACD and MACD Signal give a coherent view of momentum shifts and potential trend reversals; RSI provides momentum-extremes context and divergence signals.
- Bollinger Middle adds a volatility-normalized baseline to gauge breakouts or pullbacks in relation to typical price range.
- ATR complements the above by informing risk controls under evolving volatility, which is especially relevant for a stock like AMD that can experience volatility around earnings or AI-related news.

Next steps to proceed:
- I can retry the data fetch for AMD. Do you want me to:
  1) Retry with the same date range (2024-10-21 to 2025-10-21), or
  2) Use a shorter/current window (e.g., 2025-01-01 to 2025-10-21) to quickly get a working result, or
  3) Use a fresh range you specify?

Once the data fetch succeeds, I will:
- Retrieve the data and compute the selected indicators.
- Generate a detailed, nuanced report describing trends, cross-checks between indicators, key support/resistance levels, and actionable trade considerations for AMD.
- Append a Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points, including indicator signals and suggested actions (e.g., potential entry/exit windows, risk considerations).

If you’d like, I can also prepare an alternative indicator set (e.g., adding boll_ub and boll_lb for breakout/mean-reversion cues or including VWMA for volume-confirmed trends) as a secondary scenario for comparison.
