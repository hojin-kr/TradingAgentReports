I ran into a tool error trying to fetch AMD Reddit stock info for multiple dates. The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the daily sentiment and social-media snippets to create the full, data-driven report you asked for.

Here’s how we can proceed, and what I can still deliver right away:

Options to proceed
- Retry data fetch: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again if the tool becomes available or if you want me to try later.
- Use an alternative data path: If you have any excerpts, links, or screenshots from Reddit threads or other social sources (Twitter/X, StockTwits, etc.), paste them here and I’ll analyze sentiment and themes in detail.
- Build the framework now: I can provide a comprehensive, granular report framework and methodology that will be ready to populate with the actual data as soon as the tool works or as soon as you share sources. This saves time and ensures we have a polished deliverable once data is obtained.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A deep-dive analysis of AMD’s sentiment and news over the past week, with day-by-day sentiment signals and key themes.
- News impact assessment: What the latest headlines mean for AMD’s near-term catalysts (AI/data-center demand, product cycles, supply/demand dynamics, guidance changes, etc.).
- Social-media signal interpretation: How sentiment trends align or diverge from price action, volumes, and options activity.
- Risk factors and catalysts: What traders should watch for in the next 1–4 weeks (earnings cadence, AI market demand, competitor moves, supply chain signals, etc.).
- Practical trader takeaways: actionable ideas such as potential entry/exit zones, risk management notes, and scenarios for bullish/bearish cases.
- A final Markdown table organizing key points for quick reference.

Provisional Markdown table (structure only)
Note: Will be populated with real data once available.
- Columns: Date, Net Sentiment, Top Themes, Key Headlines, Price Move (%), Volume, News Impact, Notable Posts
- Example row (placeholder): 2025-10-21 | [pending] | [AI demand, GPU supply, guidance] | [Headline A, Headline B] | [0.0%] | [volume] | [Positive/Neutral/Negative] | [List of posts/topics]

Would you like me to
- retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
- proceed with the framework and wait for you to supply sources, or
- share a high-level AMD sentiment/news framework based on general industry context (without specific day-by-day sentiment data)?

If you prefer to proceed with the framework now, I can deliver a comprehensive report draft in the next message and attach the final Markdown table structure so you can plug in data as soon as you have it.
