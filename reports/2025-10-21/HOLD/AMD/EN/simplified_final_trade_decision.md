# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD’s AI compute potential depends on long-term deals and margin gains from its software and platform, but public proof isn’t yet available. Nvidia’s ecosystem and regulatory challenges add downside risk. Hold until concrete contracts and margin data emerge.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Bullish case (why the stock could rise)
  - Durable AI compute demand: ongoing data-center AI spending could support a long ramp for AMD’s AI chips, software, and platform.
  - End-to-end platform edge: hardware, software, and platform management work together to improve efficiency and may lower customer costs.
  - Stronger revenue visibility: signals of multi-year deals with large customers could provide steadier volumes.
  - Potential margin upside: as AI demand grows, fixed costs get spread over more sales, potentially lifting margins over time.

- Bearish case (why the stock could fall)
  - Nvidia’s ecosystem moat: CUDA and a large installed base make it hard for competitors to catch up.
  - AI capex ramp uncertainty: long-term deals are promising but timing and terms are not guaranteed.
  - Margin/mix risk: if AI workloads don’t scale or prices stay competitive, gross margins may not improve.
  - Execution risk on big deals and platform bets: large deployments can take longer to convert pilots into steady revenue.
  - Regulatory and geopolitical challenges: China exposure and export controls could limit addressable markets.
  - Valuation risk: optimism about AI could push shares higher, with downside if results don’t meet expectations.

## Risks To Watch
- Chances of large AI deals delivering durable revenue and favorable economics, with clear margin uplift.
- Progress and traction of AMD’s ROCm software and Helios platform, including real deployments and utilization.
- The pace of AI demand versus Nvidia’s ongoing ecosystem advantage.
- Regulatory developments affecting China exposure and export controls.
- If actual revenue and margin growth disappoint, the stock could re-rate quickly.
