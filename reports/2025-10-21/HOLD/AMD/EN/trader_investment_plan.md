Recommendation: Hold

Rationale (why this conclusion follows from the plan)
- The bull case for AMD is plausible but not proven at scale. Durable AI compute demand and ROCm/Helios platform could drive meaningful upside, but there is no confirmed multi-year enterprise deal with favorable economics yet.
- The bear case remains material: Nvidiaâ€™s entrenched ecosystem, uncertain deal ramp timing, potential margin compression if AI adoption stalls, and regulatory/geopolitical headwinds that could limit addressable market.
- With data gaps and reliance on large, verifiable contracts, the risk-reward favors a cautious stance rather than an immediate upgrade to a Buy.

Strategic actions (how to implement the hold)
- Portfolio posture
  - If overweight AMD: trim toward a core, maintain exposure but reduce beta risk to mitigate downside of data disappointments.
  - If neutral/underweight: avoid adding new long exposure until clearer catalysts emerge.
- Catalysts and monitoring (watch closely)
  - Confirmed multi-year AI deals with favorable economics (pricing, utilization, margins).
  - Evidence of ROCm ecosystem expansion (broader developer adoption, workload porting, real-world efficiency gains).
  - Margin trajectory signals: data showing gross margin uplift as AI compute share grows.
  - Helios platform deployment milestones with credible bookings and utilization.
  - Regulatory updates affecting China exposure or export controls; any material tightening that constrains addressable markets.
- Risk controls and mechanics
  - Use price discipline and a defined stop-loss if momentum deteriorates (e.g., breach of key moving averages with negative momentum signals).
  - Keep position sizing modest and adjustable; scale exposure up only on verifiable catalysts.
- Data plan and review cadence
  - Restore data points and compute the eight technical indicators once data is available.
  - Schedule a quarterly thesis review; upgrade to Buy only on strict, data-backed thresholds (verified deals, margin improvement, ecosystem traction).

Concrete flip-points (what would tilt the decision)
- Buy triggers: credible, multi-year enterprise deals with solid utilization terms and margin uplift; demonstrable ROCm ecosystem traction and Helios deployments with tangible bookings.
- Sell triggers: failure to convert pilots into durable, high-margin revenue; persistent weakness in ROCm adoption; regulatory developments materially reducing addressable market; technical breakdown with sustained negative momentum under multiple indicators.

Practical next steps now
- Acknowledge the data gap and set a data-recovery window to re-evaluate (e.g., pull the latest AMD disclosures and deal updates within the upcoming reporting cycle).
- Prepare a concise one-page bull/bear rebuttal and a short FAQ addressing deals, margins, and China risk.
- Start a quarterly review cadence to update catalysts, margins, and ecosystem traction; adjust position as catalysts pass strict thresholds.

Final take
- The process yields a cautious, data-driven Hold. The upside remains conditional on verifiable, favorable AI deals and margin expansion signals; downside risks from established competitors, execution risk, and regulatory headwinds are non-trivial. Maintain discipline, wait for concrete catalysts, and only increase exposure on proven data-driven milestones.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
