Sorry about that. I attempted to fetch QQQ data from Yahoo Finance but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError, which means the data source isn’t accessible right now. I’ve retried once and it’s still failing. Here’s how I’ll proceed and what I can do in the meantime.

What happened
- Issue: Data retrieval failure from get_YFin_data (FileNotFoundError).
- Attempted calls: Multiple retries; still not returning data.
- Action needed: The data backend needs to be available again. I can retry automatically, or proceed with a plan using indicators that don’t require immediate data (e.g., outlining a strategy, expected indicator set, and how I’ll interpret them once data comes in).

Recommended next steps (to get you a detailed QQQ analysis as soon as data loads)
1) I will retry fetching the price data for QQQ for 2024-10-21 to 2025-10-21.
2) Once data is retrieved, I will generate a compact, yet rich, indicator set (up to 8 indicators) that provides complementary signals without redundancy.
3) I’ll deliver:
   - A detailed, nuanced trend report for QQQ with current context (as of 2025-10-21).
   - A concluding set of actionable insights and potential trading considerations.
   - A concise Markdown table summarizing key indicators, what they signal, and how to use them.

Proposed 8-indicator set for QQQ (complementary and non-redundant)
Note: I’ll pull these from the provided indicator list once data is available. The plan is to cover trend, momentum, and volatility without overlap:

- close_50_sma: 50-day short-to-mid-term trend and dynamic support/resistance; confirms trend direction.
- close_200_sma: 200-day long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm major regime (and identifies golden/death cross contexts).
- close_10_ema: Quick momentum proxy to catch near-term shifts; useful for timely entries when paired with longer-term filters.
- macd: Momentum crossovers and trend-change signals; useful in conjunction with other filters to avoid false signals.
- macds: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD for trade signals; helps reduce noise.
- macdh: MACD histogram; magnitude of momentum changes; divergence context can be informative.
- rsi: Momentum/overbought-oversold framing; watch for divergence and 70/30 readings in context of trend.
- atr: Volatility assessment for risk management and stop placement; helps adapt position sizing to current volatility.

What I will deliver after data loads
- A detailed, nuanced report:
  - Trend framing: how the 50/200 SMA align (bullish, bearish, or choppy).
  - Momentum snapshot: MACD/macdS/macdH signals and RSI context aligned with trend.
  - Volatility context: ATR read and how it’s influencing stop levels and position sizing.
  - Potential setups: clear conditions under which a trade could be considered, with caveats for whipsaws in choppy markets.
  - Risk considerations: volatility regime, drawdown risks, and how to position sizing using ATR.
- Markdown table (key points) at the end to summarize the signals, their interpretation, and suggested actions.

If you’d like, I can proceed with an automatic retry now and then deliver the full, detailed QQQ analysis as soon as the data is available. Alternatively, if you prefer to move ahead with a hypothetical framework, I can present the 8-indicator framework and a scenario-based analysis using assumed values. Let me know which you prefer.
