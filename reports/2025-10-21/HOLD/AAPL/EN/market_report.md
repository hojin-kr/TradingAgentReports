I attempted to retrieve AAPL data and compute the selected indicators, but the data fetching service returned a file-not-found error. I can retry the data pull now or adjust the date window if you’d like. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a carefully chosen set of indicators and a plan for a detailed, nuanced analysis once the data is available.

Selected indicators (up to 8, chosen for complementary coverage of trend, momentum, and volatility)

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)  
  Purpose: Short-term momentum; quick to react to price moves.  
  Why relevant for AAPL: Captures swift shifts in daily price action and helps identify early entry/exit points in a stock known for rapid intraday moves.

- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)  
  Purpose: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance.  
  Why relevant for AAPL: Provides a smoother view of the trend, helps filter out short-term noise, and complements the 10 EMA for signal confirmation.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)  
  Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark; known for golden/death cross signals.  
  Why relevant for AAPL: Anchors the wider market context and helps distinguish secular trend from short-term fluctuations.

- macd (MACD)  
  Purpose: Momentum indicator based on differences of EMAs; crossovers signal potential trend changes.  
  Why relevant for AAPL: Useful for identifying momentum shifts in a stock with notable earnings-driven moves.

- macds (MACD Signal)  
  Purpose: Smoothing of the MACD line; crossovers with MACD can trigger trades.  
  Why relevant for AAPL: Adds a confirmation layer to MACD signals, reducing false positives in volatile periods.

- RSI (RSI)  
  Purpose: Momentum strength; overbought/oversold cues and potential divergences.  
  Why relevant for AAPL: Helps gauge whether a pullback or rally is overextended, and can be used in conjunction with trend indicators for entry timing.

- boll (Bollinger Middle)  
  Purpose: 20-period SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands; context for volatility.  
  Why relevant for AAPL: Provides a dynamic baseline and helps assess breakout or mean-reversion opportunities when paired with band context.

- atr (ATR)  
  Purpose: Volatility measure; informs risk management and position sizing.  
  Why relevant for AAPL: Useful for setting stop losses and sizing positions appropriately amid changing volatility.

What I will deliver once data is retrieved
- A detailed, nuanced trend report that integrates the eight indicators above to describe:
  - The prevailing trend direction (short, medium, and long-term) and any crossovers or confirmations across moving averages.
  - Momentum context via MACD, MACD Signal, and RSI, including any bullish/bearish divergences.
  - Volatility context from Bollinger-Basis and ATR, with implications for breakouts, mean reversion, and risk management.
  - Potential entry/exit zones using convergence/divergence signals across MACD components, combined with price position relative to the 10 EMA, 50 SMA, and 200 SMA.
  - Risk considerations: how ATR informs stop placement and position sizing under current market volatility.

- A Markdown table at the end that neatly organizes key points (see the table example below).

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry fetching the data now (AAPL, with the same date range) or would you prefer a different date window (e.g., last 12–18 months or a roll-forward window to today)?  
- If you want, I can also adapt the indicator set (e.g., drop MACD components or add ATR-only volatility nuances) depending on your risk preferences.

Markdown table: Key indicators, categories, and reading guidance (status: awaiting data)

| Indicator | Category | What it measures / reading guidance | Why it's relevant for AAPL (current context) | Data status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; price above/below indicates near-term trend direction | Helps catch quick momentum shifts in Apple’s price action | Awaiting data |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; acts as dynamic support/resistance | Filters noise and aligns with broader trend view | Awaiting data |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; golden/death cross signals | Confirms macro direction; important for strategic stance | Awaiting data |
| macd | MACD | Momentum via MACD line relative to signal; crossovers signal changes | Core momentum signal; useful for trend change detection | Awaiting data |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD; cross with MACD for triggers | Adds confirmation to MACD entries/exits | Awaiting data |
| RSI | Momentum | Overbought/oversold, potential divergences | Timing in stretched markets; complements trend analysis | Awaiting data |
| boll | Bollinger Middle | 20-SMA baseline; context for breakouts/reversions | Volatility context; helps judge breakout potential | Awaiting data |
| atr | Volatility | True range-based volatility; informs stop placement and sizing | Critical for risk management under changing volatility | Awaiting data |

If you’d like, I can retry immediately to fetch the data (AAPL 2024-01-01 to 2025-10-21, and the eight indicators above). Please confirm, and I’ll run the data pull and then deliver the full, detailed trend report with the actual readings and a comprehensive interpretation.
