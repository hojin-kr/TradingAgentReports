# Investment Report: AAPL
## Executive Summary

## Risks To Watch
- Regulatory changes affecting App Store monetization and margins.
- China exposure and broader macro/regulatory headwinds.

- Execution risk if one pillar weakens; data gaps could mislead decisions.
- Market-wide price swings that amplify volatility.
