Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit sentiment data for AAPL on 2025-10-21 using the get_reddit_stock_info tool, but I hit a backend error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the data source or path the tool expects isn’t available at the moment. I can try again, or we can switch to an alternative data collection approach if you’d like.

What I can do next (pick one or both):
- Retry the Reddit sentiment fetch for AAPL on 2025-10-21 now (or broaden the window to the past 7 days if you prefer).
- Attempt to pull sentiment from other sources or apply a manual qualitative scan if another tool/source is available.

In the meantime, I can proceed with a plan for the comprehensive long report you asked for. Here’s how I’ll structure it once I can pull the data:

- Executive snapshot
  - Key sentiment trends over the past week
  - Any notable spikes in positive/negative discussion
  - Immediate implications for traders

- Daily sentiment breakdown
  - Day-by-day sentiment scores or qualitative themes (e.g., product news, earnings, supply chain, AI initiatives)
  - Top talking points from the community each day
  - Any recurring memes or narratives that could influence price action

- News and events filter
  - Summary of relevant company news in the last week (product launches, earnings, partnerships, regulatory updates)
  - How the news aligns or contrasts with community sentiment
  - Potential overhangs or catalysts for the near term

- Thematic analysis
  - Core themes: hardware/AI integration, services growth, iPhone cycle, supply chain, regulatory environment, valuation chatter
  - Positioning by crowd (bullish vs. bearish premises)

- Risk signals and trader implications
  - Sentiment-driven risk flags (e.g., extreme optimism/pessimism, crowding in options, shifts in discussion topics)
  - Potential short-term catalysts or headwinds
  - Suggested trading considerations (scenarios for BUY/HOLD/SELL if sentiment aligns with other indicators)

- quantitative/qualitative synthesis
  - If sentiment data becomes available, I’ll provide a concise scorecard (e.g., average daily sentiment, max drawdown risk signals, notable divergence vs. price action)

- Final take and actionable tips for traders
  - Short-term view (next 1–2 weeks)
  - Medium-term view (next 1–2 months)
  - Any cautions regarding data reliability or noise in social chatter

- Appendix: Makrdown table
  - A clean, easy-to-read table at the end that summarizes:
    - Date
    - Daily sentiment theme
    - Notable Reddit posts/topics
    - Related news events
    - Trader takeaway (bullish/bearish/neutral)

If you’d like, I can retry the Reddit data fetch right away. Please confirm:
1) Retry now for 2025-10-21, or broaden to the last 7 days?
2) Do you want me to also pull from other public social sources if the Reddit tool remains unavailable (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, financial forums), or strictly Reddit only?
3) Any specific Apple products or News events you want me to pay extra attention to (e.g., iPhone cycle, AI announcements, services growth)?

Once I have the data (or if you approve the fallback), I’ll deliver the full long-form report plus the final Markdown table.
