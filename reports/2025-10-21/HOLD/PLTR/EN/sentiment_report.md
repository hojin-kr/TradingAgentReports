I’m running into a backend error fetching the Reddit-related stock info for PLTR right now (FileNotFoundError from the tool). I can’t retrieve the latest Reddit sentiment data for 2025-10-21 at the moment. I can still move forward in two ways:

Option A: Retry and fetch data again
- I can attempt the Reddit feed retrieval again now or after a short delay and then proceed with the full report once I have those signals.

Option B: Proceed with a sentiment-and-news framework using alternative sources
- I’ll compile a comprehensive long report based on general market sentiment signals, recent news headlines, and day-by-day sentiment patterns from sources other than Reddit (e.g., major news outlets, official PLTR announcements, and other social platforms), clearly marking where data is inferred from alternatives.

Please tell me which option you prefer. In the meantime, here’s how I will structure the final report and the kind of granular insights I’ll provide once data is available.

Plan for the PLTR long report (with day-by-day sentiment analysis and news)
- Executive snapshot
  - High-level sentiment tilt (bullish, bearish, mixed)
  - Key catalysts or risks driving sentiment in the past week
  - Implications for option traders, swing traders, and long-term holders

- Data methodology (what I’ll pull and how I’ll interpret it)
  - Reddit sentiment (when available) by day, topic clusters (AI partnerships, earnings, product deployments, regulatory, etc.)
  - Other social sentiment sources (StockTwits, X/tweets mentioning PLTR, etc.)
  - News flow: notable company announcements, partnerships, lawsuits, product launches, earnings guidance
  - Price/action context: intra-week price moves, volume spikes, volatility regime shifts

- Daily sentiment and key themes (past 7 days)
  - Day 1: sentiment, top sentiment drivers, notable headlines
  - Day 2: sentiment, top drivers, notable headlines
  - ...
  - Day 7: sentiment, top drivers, notable headlines
  - Cross-day synthesis: momentum shifts, recurring themes, divergence between sentiment and price

- Thematic insights and implications for traders
  - Narrative clusters (AI/verticals, government/compliance, data license deals, operating margins)
  - How sentiment aligns or diverges from price action and volume
  - Implied volatility implications (e.g., if sentiment is turning negative ahead of a potential catalysts window)

- Risk factors to monitor
  - External macro signals (tech stock rotation, AI policy risk, regulatory chatter)
  - Company-specific risks (execution versus expectations, partner/news pipeline)
  - Sentiment backlash or overhang risks (e.g., over-optimistic AI hype)

- Trade ideas and scenarios
  - If sentiment improves with constructive news: potential long entry/scale-in levels
  - If sentiment deteriorates or key catalysts disappoint: hedging ideas, exit points, or risk-off positioning
  - Optional: options strategy considerations (e.g., straddles/strangles around catalysts)

- Quantitative style notes
  - Signal strength scales (e.g., sentiment score ranges, confidence levels)
  - How I’d weight different data sources to form a composite sentiment score

- Final synthesis and takeaways
  - TL;DR for different trader profiles
  - What to watch in the next 1–2 weeks

Makrdown table (organizational end-table you’ll see in the final report)
- I’ll fill this with concrete findings once data is available (or when you approve alternative data sources). Here’s a template of the table I’ll include at the end:

- Key Data Points and Signals
  - Aspect
  - Source(s)
  - Day / Window
  - Signals (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
  - Confidence
  - Potential Market Impact
  - Trader Implications

- Notable Headlines and Themes
  - Headline / Theme
  - Source
  - Day
  - Sentiment Tilt
  - Price/Volume Context
  - Risk/Opportunity Markers

- Price Action Context
  - Period
  - Close / Range
  - Volume
  - Implied Volatility Change
  - Alignment with Sentiment

- Risk Flags
  - Risk Factor
  - Likelihood (Low/Med/High)
  - Potential Price Impact
  - Mitigation Ideas

Next steps
- Tell me which option you want:
  1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now and proceed with a Reddit-centric weekly sentiment report, or
  2) Proceed with Option B (alternative sources) and deliver the full, granular report with a clearly labeled sentiment-from-alternatives approach.

If you have any preference for additional data sources (e.g., include StockTwits, X sentiment, or specific news outlets), tell me now and I’ll tailor the data mix accordingly. Once you confirm, I’ll deliver the full, detailed report in the format above, including the final Makrdown table.
