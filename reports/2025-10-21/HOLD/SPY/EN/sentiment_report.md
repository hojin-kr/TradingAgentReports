I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock news for SPY on 2025-10-21, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). It looks like the data source for that tool is temporarily unavailable. I can retry in a bit, or we can proceed with an alternative plan now.

Here are two paths you can choose:

Option A — Retry fetch now
- I’ll try the Reddit-based news feed for SPY again as soon as the tool is available.
- If successful, I’ll deliver a comprehensive long-form report detailing:
  - Daily sentiment (positive/neutral/negative) over the past week
  - Top themes and keywords driving sentiment (e.g., macro data, Fed policy, inflation, risk appetite, geopolitical events)
  - Notable Reddit threads and influencers, with approximate impact signals
  - A synchronized view with price action and volatility (SPY price, intraday ranges, VIX implications)
  - Quick-hit implications for traders (potential setups, hedges, or risk-on/risk-off markers)
  - A final Markdown table summarizing key points

Option B — Proceed with a best-effort framework now (no new Reddit data)
- I’ll provide a detailed, traders-focused framework and insights for SPY based on general market drivers and sentiment mechanics, clearly labeled as model-based expectations rather than data-driven from Reddit for the current window.
- I’ll still prepare a structure and a Markdown table, but without the Reddit-specific numerics until the data tool is available again.

If you’d like, I can also do a quick, grounded overview of SPY sentiment drivers in the past week using public macro narrative (Fed expectations, inflation data, earnings cadence among S&P 500 components, geopolitical risk, etc.) to give you actionable takeaways while we wait for the Reddit feed to come back.

What would you prefer?
- Retry the Reddit fetch now (Option A), or
- Proceed with Option B (framework-based analysis now), or
- A mix: I can start with the framework and then insert Reddit specifics as soon as the data tool returns.
