Thanks for the update. I tried to fetch the Reddit-based stock sentiment for GOOGL (Alphabet) for 2025-10-21, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like there’s a temporary issue on the data-fetching side, so I can’t pull the Reddit data right now. I can retry shortly, or proceed with an alternative plan if you’d prefer.

Here are your options:
- Option A: I retry pulling the Reddit data now and proceed with a full, data-backed report once the fetch succeeds.
- Option B: I proceed with a comprehensive framework and analysis using whatever non-Reddit sources I can access, plus a solid methodology for when Reddit data comes in.
- Option C: You specify other data sources you want me to prioritize (e.g., major news outlets, social platforms besides Reddit, earnings commentary, etc.), and I’ll tailor the report around those.

While we await a fix or your direction, here’s a robust structure I will follow for the long-form report on GOOGL (Alphabet) and a ready-to-fill Markdown table at the end.

What the full report will cover (planned)

  - Overall sentiment trend over the past 7 days (once Reddit data is available) with a quick summary for traders.

- Notable quotes or posts that move sentiment, with safe summarization

Proposed Markdown table template (end of report)
This is a ready-to-fill table you can copy into your notes or a report. It’s empty on purpose so you can drop in real data as soon as Reddit data is retrieved.

Markdown table: Key Points by Day/Source

Next steps
- Please tell me which option you prefer (A, B, or C), and whether you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch immediately.
- If you want me to proceed with Option B or C now, I’ll start compiling the framework and initial analysis using available sources and a transparent methodology, and I’ll clearly mark any data gaps or assumptions.

If you’d like me to retry the Reddit pull right away, I can do that and then generate the full, detailed report with the actual sentiment data as soon as the tool succeeds.
