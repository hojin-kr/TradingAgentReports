I'm running into an internal issue fetching live data for GOOGL right now (the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError). I can proceed with a solid indicator plan so you’re ready as soon as the data fetch succeeds, and I’ll provide a detailed, nuanced analysis once we have the price series. Here’s the chosen set of indicators (8 in total) with rationale and how they complement each other for a generic GOOGL analysis.

Selected indicators (8, diversified and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it helps: Helps identify the ongoing trend context and potential pullback zones, especially when price tests this level.
- close_200_sma
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and trend confirmation.
  - Why it helps: Useful for spotting major regime shifts (golden/death cross with shorter MAs under a fuller setup) and aligning trades with the broader trend.
- close_10_ema
  - Purpose: Short-term momentum and early shifts.
  - Why it helps: Captures quicker price reactions and potential entry/exit timing; good for filtering signals from slower movers when used with the longer-term MAs.
- macd
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line vs. signal line.
  - Why it helps: Crossovers around zero, as well as divergences, can indicate shifts in momentum that align with or against the trend.
- macds
  - Purpose: MACD signal line, smoothing for confirmation.
  - Why it helps: Provides a confirmatory signal when MACD crosses the signal line, reducing false positives from the MACD alone.
- macdh
  - Purpose: MACD histogram, momentum strength visualization.
  - Why it helps: Highlights the strength of momentum and early divergence clues; can signal acceleration or weakening momentum ahead of price moves.
- rsi
  - Purpose: Momentum magnitude and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why it helps: Identifies potential reversals or pullbacks when momentum is extreme; useful for spotting divergences in uptrends or downtrends.
- atr
  - Purpose: Volatility measure to inform risk management (stops, sizing).
  - Why it helps: Higher ATR implies wider price swings—useful for adjusting position size and stop distances, especially in volatile periods.

Rationale for this set
- Coverage: The mix provides trend context (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum signals (MACD family and RSI), and volatility/risk management (ATR). This combination helps reduce false signals by requiring multiple, complementary confirmations.
- Complementarity: Moving averages set the stage for the trend; MACD family adds momentum and crossovers; RSI adds a momentum-mook for overbought/oversold context; ATR informs risk controls in the face of volatility.
- Redundancy avoidance: I avoided duplicating similar signals (e.g., choosing RSI over stochastic RSI to prevent overlapping momentum measures) and kept to a focused 8 indicators.

What I will do once data fetch succeeds
- Compute all eight indicators on the latest available data for GOOGL.
- Generate a detailed narrative describing:
  - Current trend direction and strength (via 50/200 SMA alignment and 10 EMA positioning).
  - MACD/macd/macdh signals and any crossovers/divergences aligned with price and RSI.
  - RSI levels, momentum shifts, and potential divergence signals against price action.
  - ATR-based volatility context and implications for risk management (stops and position sizing).
  - Any observed interactions between price levels and dynamic support/resistance provided by the moving averages.
  - Potential entry/exit zones given multi-indicator convergence or divergence (without giving a direct BUY/HOLD/SELL recommendation unless you request it).
- Present practical takeaways for trading decisions, including
  - Suggested stop levels using ATR as a risk metric.
  - Watch-list levels: key price levels around the 50/200 SMAs and any recent MACD cross points.
  - A brief note on how to adapt in different market regimes (range-bound vs trending).

Next steps
- I will reattempt the data fetch for GOOGL as soon as the data source is reachable.
- If you prefer, I can also run a backup analysis with a fallback dataset or proceed with a qualitative outlook based on known factors, but the most actionable insights will come from the live indicators once the data is retrieved.

Appendix: Key points in a concise table
| Indicator | Purpose | How signals are interpreted (high level) |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, support/resistance | Price above/below indicates bullish/bearish trend; cross with price can signal changes |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above suggests long-term uptrend; below suggests long-term downtrend; cross with other MA adds context |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum / entry timing | Price above/below indicates quick momentum shift; crossovers with price are timing clues |
| macd | Momentum and trend-change signals | MACD line vs signal line cross and zero-cross; divergences help confirm trend shifts |
| macds | MACD signal confirmation | Crosses of MACD vs signal add reliability to MACD moves |
| macdh | Momentum strength visualization | Histogram changes highlight acceleration or waning momentum; divergences are early warnings |
| rsi | Momentum magnitude / overbought-oversold | >70 or <30 imply extremes; watch for divergences against price to spot reversals |
| atr | Volatility and risk management | Rising ATR signals higher volatility; use to adjust stops and sizing |

If you’d like, I can proceed with the analysis as soon as the data fetch succeeds. Tell me whether you want me to proceed with a purely analytical report (no trade recommendations) or to generate explicit buy/hold/sell signals once we have the indicators in place.
