Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch Reddit stock info for NFLX on 2025-10-21, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the Reddit data source is temporarily unavailable from this environment.

I can proceed in one of two ways:

Option A — Retry and fetch Reddit data when the tool is back
- I’ll retry the Reddit data pull for NFLX on 2025-10-21 and then produce a comprehensive, up-to-date long report with:
  - Daily sentiment trends (last 7 days) from Reddit posts/comments
  - Key Reddit topics/themes (content quality, pricing/tier changes, ad-supported plan, password-sharing crackdowns, stock discussions, earnings expectations, narrative around content slate)
  - Any notable spikes in bullish/bearish sentiment and potential catalysts
  - Implications for traders (short-term moves, risk factors, and possible consensus shifts)

Option B — Proceed now with a best-effort framework using non-Reddit sources and placeholders
- I’ll deliver a detailed analysis framework and a filled-in narrative using publicly known fundamentals and typical sentiment drivers for NFLX, with clear placeholders where Reddit data would go. This lets you lock in the structure while we wait for the tool to recover.
- I’ll still provide a final Markdown summary table and actionable takeaways, but Reddit-specific sentiment will be marked as “pending” until the data source is available again.

Which option would you prefer? If you’re okay with Option B right now, I’ll produce a thorough framework and an actionable report structure you can use immediately, and I’ll populate Reddit sentiment as soon as the data tool is functioning again. If you want me to retry immediately for Option A, I’ll do that and return with the Reddit-backed insights as soon as the tool responds.
