I attempted to fetch NFLX data and run the indicator calculations, but the data retrieval tool is currently returning a file-not-found error. I can retry shortly or switch to an alternative data source if you’d like. In the meantime, here is a detailed, non-data-dependent framework using a balanced set of indicators that would give complementary insights for NFLX (a high-volatility, growth-focused NASDAQ name). This selection avoids redundancy and covers trend, momentum, volatility, and volume confirmation.

Selected indicators (up to 8) and why they’re suitable for NFLX
- close_50_sma (50 SMA): Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to confirm the prevailing trend and to filter noise from shorter-term moves.
- close_200_sma (200 SMA): Long-term trend benchmark. Helps identify secular trend direction (bullish above the 200 SMA, bearish below) and potential golden/death cross signals when used with moving averages.
- close_10_ema (10 EMA): Responsive short-term momentum gauge. Captures quick shifts in price and can help time entries when aligned with longer-term trend.
- macd (MACD): Core momentum measure based on EMAs. Crossover signals and convergence/divergence help spot trend changes and the strength of moves.
- macds (MACD Signal): The smoothed MACD line. Crossovers with the MACD line provide more robust entry/exit cues and can help filter false signals.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Visualizes momentum strength and divergence early. Positive/expanding histogram supports rallies; negative/expanding histogram supports declines.
- atr (ATR): Realized volatility measure. Guides position sizing, stop placement, and risk management; higher ATR indicates wider price swings, which can inform stop placement and drawdown tolerance.
- vwma (VWMA): Volume-weighted moving average. Confirms price moves with volume, helping validate breakouts or pullbacks when price interacts with volume-supported levels.

How these indicators work together for NFLX
- Trend confirmation: Use price relative to 50 SMA and 200 SMA to determine whether the stock is in a broader uptrend or downtrend. When price sits above both, and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA, the setup is more favorable for long-side plays; the opposite suggests caution or short-side bias.
- Momentum timing: Use MACD and MACD Signal alignments to identify momentum shifts. A bullish setup would be MACD crossing above MACD Signal with a positive MACD Histogram, ideally supported by price trading above the 50/200 SMAs and a rising 10 EMA.
- Short-term pressure: The 10 EMA can help flag quick pullbacks or accelerations within the prevailing trend. If the price respects the 10 EMA as support in an uptrend, that adds a potential bounce signal when other indicators align.
- Volatility context: ATR provides the current volatility baseline. Higher ATR values mean wider stop bands and potentially larger price swings, so risk controls should be adjusted accordingly. In high-volatility regimes, rely more on MACD/MACD Histogram confirmation and VWMA support.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA ensures price moves are supported by volume. Breakouts or rallies accompanied by rising VWMA-bolstered volume are more trustworthy than price action alone.

Illustrative interpretation guidelines (no specific buy/sell recommendations without data)
- Bullish alignment: Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA; 50 SMA above 200 SMA; MACD line above MACD Signal with a growing MACD Histogram; ATR not spiking excessively; price above VWMA with VWMA trending higher. This combination suggests a trend-following setup with momentum and volume support.
- Bearish alignment: Price below 50 SMA and 200 SMA; 50 SMA below 200 SMA; MACD line below MACD Signal with a declining MACD Histogram; ATR elevated with rising volatility; price below VWMA or VWMA declining. Indicates a trend-following downside with momentum and volume confirmation.
- Mixed/transition: Mixed signals between short-term (10 EMA and MACD timing) and longer-term trend (50/200 SMA). In choppy markets, rely more on VWMA and ATR for context, and consider smaller position sizing or wait for a confirmation candle that closes beyond key thresholds.

Limitations and caveats
- Data quality and timing: All interpretations depend on up-to-date, accurate price data. If the data feed is delayed or incomplete, indicators can give misleading signals.
- Market regime sensitivity: NFLX can exhibit abrupt regime shifts (e.g., earnings surprises, subscriber changes, or macro-driven rotations). It’s important to validate signals with earnings calendars and sector/market context.
- Over-reliance risk: No single indicator is foolproof. Using a combination reduces false positives but does not eliminate risk.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching NFLX data and compute the indicators as soon as the data source is available again.
- If you have a preferred date range or want me to switch to a manual data upload, let me know.
- I can also swap in alternative indicators (e.g., RSI, Bollinger bands, or Stochastic) if you want a different flavor, but I’ve kept the current 8 as a balanced mix of trend, momentum, volatility, and volume.

Summary table of indicators and roles
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend confirmation, trend regime
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum sensitivity
- macd: Momentum trend changes and crossovers
- macds: MACD line signal crossovers for robustness
- macdh: Momentum strength and divergence visualization
- atr: Volatility and risk management context
- vwma: Volume-adjusted confirmation of moves

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now or after you confirm, and once data is available I’ll generate a full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators (including interpretation, potential entry/exit filters, and a concise verdict for NFLX).
