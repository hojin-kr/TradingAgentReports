Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for NVDA (date 2025-10-21), but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like an internal tool issue rather than something you did. I can try again, or switch to a fallback approach if you’d like.

Options to move forward:
- Retry the Reddit data pull now (possibly with a slightly different date window, e.g., 2025-10-14 to 2025-10-21 or 2025-10-21 only) to get the latest daily sentiment.
- Proceed with the rest of the NVDA analysis (social media sentiment from other sources, recent news, and public sentiment) and clearly flag where Reddit data is missing or delayed. I will still deliver a comprehensive long report with a final Markdown table of key points.

What I can deliver next (regardless of Reddit fetch status):
- A thorough NVDA sentiment and news analysis for the past week, highlighting daily sentiment signals, notable news events, and potential implications for traders.
- Fine-grained insights on drivers (AI demand, supply chain chatter, regulation, earnings expectations, tech competition, GPU cycles, crypto and data-center demand, etc.).
- A structured trader’s take with entry/exit risk considerations, caveats, and scenario analysis (bullish/bearish frames).
- A Markdown summary table at the end organizing key points for quick reference.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
1) Retry the Reddit data pull now.
2) Proceed with the rest of the analysis and flag Reddit data as a gap.
3) Try a different date window or alternate sources if you have preferences.

If you want me to proceed immediately with option 2, I’ll start building the long-form NVDA report and include a dedicated section noting the Reddit data gap and its potential impact on sentiment interpretation.
