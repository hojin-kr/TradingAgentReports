I attempted to fetch NVDA data with the provided tool, but the data retrieval step failed due to an internal tool error (FileNotFoundError). I can still give you a robust indicator plan and a detailed interpretation framework you can use once the data is available. If you want, I can re-run the data fetch as soon as the tool is back up or if you provide a CSV file I can analyze locally.

Indicator plan (8 indicators, complementary, non-redundant)

Rationale for NVDA context
- NVDA is a high-volatility, high-growth stock with pronounced trend phases around AI demand and earnings. You want a combination of:
  - Trend confirmation (to avoid trading against the major move)
  - Momentum signals (for timely entries/exits in a trend)
  - Volatility context (to size positions and set stops)
  - A volume/price corroboration (to confirm breakout or breakdown moves)
- The 8 indicators below are chosen to give a well-rounded view without overlap (e.g., avoid duplicating RSI with Stochastic RSI, etc.).

Selected indicators (up to 8)

1) close_50_sma
- What it measures: Medium-term trend (50-day simple moving average).
- Signals to watch: Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend bias; price below 50SMA suggests downtrend bias. A cross of price or close above the 50SMA can act as a dynamic support and a potential entry point when combined with other signals.
- NVDA-specific note: In recent cycles, NVDA has often respected the 50SMA during sustained rallies, using it as a stair-step support in pullbacks.

2) close_200_sma
- What it measures: Long-term trend (200-day simple moving average).
- Signals to watch: Price above 200SMA indicates long-term uptrend; price below indicates long-term downtrend. Look for golden/death cross as strategic trend confirmation (e.g., 50SMA crossing above/below 200SMA can provide larger-frame context).
- NVDA-specific note: Golden/death cross momentum signals can precede multi-month trend rotations; use as a higher-timeframe risk filter.

3) close_10_ema
- What it measures: Short-term momentum via a responsive exponential moving average.
- Signals to watch: Price or trendline interactions with the 10-EMA, and crossovers with other EMAs (like 50SMA) can provide timely entry cues.
- NVDA-specific note: In fast-moving AI-name rallies, the 10-EMA helps flag quick shifts in momentum that precede larger trend moves.

4) macd
- What it measures: MACD line vs. signal line momentum and trend changes.
- Signals to watch: MACD line crossing above the signal line; MACD histogram turning positive; divergence between price and MACD for potential reversals.
- NVDA-specific note: In volatile growth moves, MACD crossovers can occur, but should be filtered by trend context (50SMA/200SMA) to reduce false positives.

5) macds
- What it measures: MACD signal line value (the EMA smoothing of MACD).
- Signals to watch: Crossovers with the MACD line (the main MACD) trigger signals; use with macd for confirmation.
- NVDA-specific note: A cross above zero plus a rising histogram strengthens a bullish bias during uptrends; a cross below zero supports bearish bias during downtrends.

6) macdh
- What it measures: MACD histogram (momentum strength visually).
- Signals to watch: Histogram rising toward positive territory confirms momentum; histogram contracting or turning negative indicates fading momentum or a possible reversal.
- NVDA-specific note: Divergence between MACD histogram and price can foreshadow pullbacks or consolidations in extended rallies.

7) rsi
- What it measures: Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions.
- Signals to watch: RSI crossing above 70 can signal overbought conditions (caution on long entries in strong uptrends); RSI crossing below 30 can signal oversold conditions (potential bounce); watch for bullish/bearish divergences.
- NVDA-specific note: In strong uptrends, RSI can remain overbought for extended periods; use RSI in conjunction with trend and MACD signals rather than as a standalone entry trigger.

8) atr
- What it measures: Average True Range, a volatility measure.
- Signals to watch: Rising ATR indicates increasing volatility; use to adjust position sizing and stop-loss distances. Declining ATR can indicate consolidation or a calm period.
- NVDA-specific note: AV/AI-driven name like NVDA often experiences volatility surges around earnings, product announcements, or AI market shifts; ATR provides a pragmatic framework for risk management during such periods.

How to use these indicators together (a practical decision framework)
- Core trend check: Confirm alignment with long-term trend
  - Price above 200SMA (long-term uptrend) or below (downtrend). If the price is clearly above 200SMA and 50SMA is rising, bias toward long entries.
- Momentum confirmation: Add short-term momentum signals
  - Look for price trading above the 50SMA with a bullish MACD cross (MACD above signal) and a rising MACD histogram (macdh positive and increasing). RSI should be rising but not in extreme overbought territory unless you’re trading a breakout.
- Entry timing: Use a confluence of signals
  - Price above 50SMA and 10-EMA bullish relation; MACD bullish cross (macd above macds) with macdh turning positive; RSI rising toward 60-70 (avoid overbought unless a breakout is very strong and confirmed by volatility expansion).
- Volatility and risk management: Position sizing and stops
  - Use ATR to set initial stops (e.g., 1.5x ATR or 2x ATR below breakout/support levels). If ATR is rising, expect bigger moves; consider wider stops and smaller position sizing to manage risk.
- Breakout considerations: Volatility bands
  - When price breaks above the Bollinger middle/upper band context is important; since Bollinger bands aren’t in the chosen set, rely on ATR for volatility context and take caution with thin-volume breakouts in NVDA’s liquidity windows.
- Divergences: Watch for warning signals
  - If price makes higher highs while RSI fails to make higher highs or MACD histogram diverges, this can indicate potential pullbacks in the near term, especially if price approaches a resistance level implied by the 50SMA/200SMA confluence.
- Risk gating: Avoid overloading on signals in choppy markets
  - In range-bound or high-variance conditions, rely more on longer-frame trend (200SMA, MACD) and ATR-based risk controls rather than chasing every momentum signal.

Notes on data availability
- Once you provide the NVDA price data (or I can re-run once the data tool is functioning), I can:
  - Compute the current values for each indicator
  - Identify exact crossovers, divergences, and current momentum state
  - Produce a precise, data-backed signal synthesis (e.g., “Bullish confluence: price above 50SMA and 200SMA; MACD bullish cross; RSI rising toward 60; ATR increasing; suggested entry and stop levels”)
- If you’d like, I can also add one more complementary indicator (e.g., VWMA for volume-adjusted trend confirmation) in a follow-up, but for now the 8 indicators above give a solid, non-redundant framework.

Proposed output you can expect once data is available
- A concise signal sheet that shows the current reading for each indicator, cross-checks, and the recommended action (BUY/HOLD/SELL or no action) with a rationale.
- A risk-adjusted trade plan including suggested entry, stop, and target ranges based on NVDA’s volatility regime.

Markdown table: key indicators and rationale (for quick reference)

| Indicator | What it measures | Signals to watch | How it helps NVDA decisions | Typical usage note |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| close_50_sma | Mid-term trend (50-day) | Price above/below 50SMA; crossovers | Confirms trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Useful for timing entries in established trends; lags price modestly |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend (200-day) | Price above/below 200SMA; golden/death cross | Provides strategic, macro trend context | Best for filtering trades rather than entry timing |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price/EMA crossovers; price above/below 10EMA | Quick momentum shifts to help timing | Prone to noise in choppy markets; should be filtered by longer-term trends |
| macd | Momentum/trend via EMA differences | MACD cross above/below MACD signal; histogram changes | Confirms momentum shifts and trend changes | Crossovers gain strength with magnitude of histogram; use with trend filters |
| macds | MACD signal line | Interaction with MACD line; zero-line behavior | Smoother signal for MACD interpretation | Part of a broader MACD-based strategy to avoid false positives |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Histogram rising/falling; divergences | Visual momentum strength; early divergence cues | Can be volatile; use with other signals for confirmation |
| rsi | Momentum; overbought/oversold | RSI rising through 40-70; overbought near 70; divergence | Identifies momentum extremes and potential reversals | In strong uptrends, overbought readings can persist; context matters |
| atr | Volatility/volatility-based risk | Rising/falling ATR; use for stop sizing | Guides risk management and position sizing | Reactive measure; pair with trend and momentum for best results |

Next steps
- If you can re-run the data fetch (or share the NVDA CSV), I’ll generate:
  - The exact current indicator values for NVDA
  - A clear BUY/HOLD/SELL recommendation based on the confluence of signals
  - A precise entry/stop/target framework aligned with your risk preferences
- If you prefer, I can also run a parallel check with VWMA (volume-weighted moving average) as a supplementary indicator to validate price action with volume.

Would you like me to attempt the data fetch again now, or would you prefer to provide the data file so I can proceed with the exact, data-backed readings and a concrete trading recommendation?
