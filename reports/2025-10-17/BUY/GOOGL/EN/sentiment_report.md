Sorry — I hit an internal tool error fetching Reddit data for GOOGL on 2025-10-17 (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data pull, or proceed with a structured plan now and fill in the Reddit findings as soon as the tool comes back up. Here are two options:

Option A: Retry now (preferred for a fuller report)
- I will retry get_reddit_stock_info for GOOGL on 2025-10-17 and deliver a comprehensive long-form report that includes:
  - Day-by-day sentiment from Reddit posts over the past week
  - Key Reddit threads/topics, post volumes, and sentiment drivers
  - Alignment with the latest company news and earnings/updates from the past week
  - Price action context (intraday moves, volume, notable spikes) and any options/volatility signals if available
  - Risks, catalysts, and trading implications tailored for traders/investors
  - A concluding set of actionable takeaways
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing key points

Option B: Proceed with a best-effort report (without Reddit data)
- I’ll compile a detailed analysis using available public sources and sentiment signals I can reliably infer, but I won’t be able to cite Reddit data specifically until the tool is back. You’ll still get:
  - Executive snapshot of current state and recent news
  - Thematic sentiment drivers (buy/hold/sell impulses) from general social chatter and news
  - Trading implications and risk signals
  - A Markdown table with key points (to be updated with Reddit data once available)

If you’d like, I can go ahead with Option A and retry the Reddit data fetch immediately. If you prefer Option B, I’ll proceed with the best-effort report right away.

In the meantime, here’s the blueprint of the full report I’ll deliver (so you know what to expect and can request any additions):
