I attempted to fetch Yahoo Finance data for GOOGL, but the data retrieval step failed with a FileNotFoundError from the data tool. I can retry the fetch, adjust parameters (e.g., different date range), or proceed with a structured indicator plan and qualitative analysis while we resolve the data access issue. Here’s a focused plan and why these indicators are well-suited for a large-cap tech stock like GOOGL in a typical market environment.

Recommended 8 indicators (complementary, non-redundant)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable
- close_10_ema: Captures short-term momentum and rapid shifts in price action. Useful for timely entries/exits but can be noisy in choppy markets; benefits from confirmation with longer-term trends.
- close_50_sma: Represents a medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify regime changes when paired with 10 EMA and 200 SMA, and signals like crossovers with the longer-term averages.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend anchor. Aids in assessing the overarching market regime (bullish/bearish) and in filtering entries during pullbacks within a primary uptrend or downtrend.
- macd: Core momentum indicator showing the difference between two EMAs. Useful for spotting momentum shifts and potential trend changes via crossovers.
- macds: The MACD signal line. Crossover with MACD and MACD histogram provides clearer entry/exit signals when used with other filters.
- macdh: MACD histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and early divergence signals; helps confirm MACD crossovers and the intensity of moves.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Be mindful of divergence and the fact that RSI can stay elevated in strong uptrends; use alongside trend signals.
- atr: Measures volatility and helps with risk management (stop placement, position sizing). Useful for sizing adjustments in varying market volatility and for trailing stops.

What I’ll do once data is available
- Compute the 8 indicators on the GOOGL price data (covering a suitable window such as 1–2 years or your preferred lookback).
- Produce a detailed, nuanced trend report that includes:
  - Trend context (price relative to 50/200 SMA; any golden/death cross signals).
  - Momentum signals (MACD crossovers, MACD histogram direction, RSI level and divergence).
  - Volatility/risk framing (ATR-based stop ideas, how ATR shifts may affect position sizing).
  - Potential trade scenarios (e.g., long bias if price is above 50/200 SMA with positive MACD and RSI not overbought; caution signals if RSI is overbought and price tests upper Bollinger-like resistance ranges, etc.).
  - Caveats for real-time trading (noise in short-term signals, need for confirmation across multiple indicators).

Next steps
- Option A: I retry the data fetch with the same date window (2024-10-17 to 2025-10-17) or a shorter window if preferred.
- Option B: I fetch data from an alternate range (e.g., last 12–18 months) to ensure enough data points for reliable indicator readings.
- Option C: If you’d like to proceed immediately with the qualitative plan, I can provide the comprehensive interpretation framework and potential trade ideas based on how the indicators would typically align for GOOGL, and then validate once data is back.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
1) Retry data fetch with the original window
2) Retry with a shorter/alternative window
3) Proceed with the qualitative framework now and run the full indicator analysis once data is retrieved

Markdown table: Key indicators and rationale for GOOGL
| Indicator | Rationale for GOOGL context |
|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Captures short-term momentum; good for timely entries but needs trend confirmation. |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; complements 10 EMA and 200 SMA. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark; identifies regime and filters entries during pullbacks. |
| macd | Momentum shift signals; helps detect trend changes with crossovers. |
| macds | Filtered MACD signal timing; reduces false signals when used with MACD. |
| macdh | Momentum strength via histogram; divergence cues early signals. |
| rsi | Overbought/oversold context and momentum strength; watch for divergences. |
| atr | Volatility-based risk management; informs stop placement and position sizing. |

Note: I’m ready to retry data retrieval as soon as you approve the preferred path.
