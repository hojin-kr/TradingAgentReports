I attempted to fetch AMD price data via the Yahoo Finance data tool, but the data retrieval service returned an error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I’ll outline a robust indicator setup you can use once data is available, and I’ll explain how each indicator can help with AMD's typical volatility and AI/tech-cycle dynamics. If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now or on your go-ahead.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators) for AMD
- close_10_ema: A short-term momentum indicator. Use for quick shifts in price action and to spot potential entry points when the price crosses above/below this responsive line. Helpful to catch early moves in a volatile stock like AMD.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction. Helps confirm the prevailing trend and provides a dynamic support/resistance level. Use together with faster signals to filter noise.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming the overarching trend (golden/death crosses). Best for broad strategic context rather than precise entry timing.
- macd: MACD line crossing the signal and the MACD histogram’s behavior provide momentum signals and potential trend-change cues. Useful in conjunction with trend checks from price/action around support/resistance.
- macds: MACD Signal line. Crossovers with MACD line reinforce buy/sell signals and help reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- rsi: RSI momentum gauge. Flag overbought/oversold zones and potential reversals. Be mindful in strong uptrends where RSI can stay elevated; use with trend context from the moving averages.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA). Acts as a dynamic centerline for price movement and helps identify breakout or mean-reversion tendencies when used with the upper/lower bands.
- atr: ATR (volatility). Useful to gauge current volatility levels and to set relative stop-losses or position-sizing adjustments. Helps you manage risk in a stock with AMD’s typical volatility.

Rationale and how these fit AMD’s context
- AMD has shown pronounced price swings driven by AI/data-center demand, competitive dynamics, and tech cycles. A mix of short-term momentum (close_10_ema, macd/macds), medium/long-term trend context (close_50_sma, close_200_sma), momentum/psychology (rsi), volatility/risk management (atr), and volatility-bounded price channels (boll) provides a well-rounded view.
- The combination avoids redundancy: you get both trend context (50/200 SMAs) and momentum (10 EMA and MACD family), complemented by volatility (ATR) and volatility-based envelope (Bollinger middle). RSI adds a momentum-rotation perspective without overlapping MACD’s signal structure.
- If price breaks above the Boll middle and holds with rising RSI and MACD bullish signals, that would support a stronger up-move in AMD. Conversely, prices failing to clear the 50/200 SMA with a weakening MACD and RSI dropping toward oversold zones could signal consolidation or a potential down move.

What I can deliver once data is available
- A detailed trend report describing:
  - The current trend direction across short, medium, and long horizons (via close_10_ema vs. close_50_sma vs. close_200_sma).
  - Momentum signals (MACD, MACDS) and any divergences.
  - Momentum exhaustion or continuation signals from RSI.
  - Volatility regime from ATR and potential breakout/mean-reversion context from Bollinger middle and bands.
  - Volume-adjusted context if VWMA later becomes available (not in this 8-indicator set; I can include VWMA if you’d like a 9th indicator when you permit a slight expansion).

Proposed next steps
- Option A: I retry fetching the AMD data now and, once the data is retrieved, I generate a detailed, data-driven trend report using the 8 indicators above.
- Option B: If you prefer to proceed immediately with the framework, I can present a data-free, scenario-based interpretation for current AMD conditions using the indicator framework and you can share actual values later for a precise analysis.

Markdown table: quick reference for the 8 indicators and their interpretive signals for AMD
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AMD | How it informs action |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| close_10_ema | Short-term price average | Price crossing above/below indicates quick momentum shifts | Look for entry on bullish cross; exit/defensive if cross reverses |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction | Price above 50 SMA suggests uptrend; below suggests downtrend | Use with trend confirmation from other indicators for timing |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200 SMA signals long-term uptrend; below signals downtrend | Strategy alignment: trend-following in uptrend; caution in downtrend |
| macd | Momentum via MACD line and histogram | MACD line crossing above signal is bullish; MACD histogram growing bullish signals strength | Use cross signals with price action and SMA context to confirm entries |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Crossovers reinforce momentum shifts flagged by MACD | Filter false positives when combined with RSI and price-positioning |
| rsi | Relative strength momentum | RSI rising toward overbought (>70) in uptrends; falling toward oversold (<30) in declines | Watch for divergences; confirm with trend signals (SMA) before acting |
| boll | Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA) | Price around/move away from middle line indicating breakout or mean-reversion pressure | Breakouts near upper band with bullish momentum can be entries; mean-reversion near middle band can show consolidation |
| atr | Volatility measure | Rising ATR means higher volatility; lower ATR suggests consolidation | Adjust stop-losses/position sizes; position sizing to reflect risk |

Note: The data retrieval step is currently blocked due to the FileNotFoundError. If you’d like, I can retry fetching AMD data now and then provide the full, data-driven trend report based on these indicators. Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry data fetch now and return a complete, trend-driven report with the eight indicators
- Proceed with the indicator framework and wait for you to supply or confirm data when ready

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now?
