I tried to fetch the latest Reddit stock data for AMD (2025-10-17) but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I don’t have an alternate data feed right now, so I can’t pull the Reddit-based sentiment data at the moment.

Options to proceed:
- Option A: Retry fetching Reddit data now (or you can ask me to retry after a short interval) and then generate the full long-form report with the day-by-day sentiment.
- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort AMD analysis using non-Reddit sources (news, public sentiment signals from other platforms like X/Twitter, StockTwits, general market chatter) and recent company news. I’ll provide a comprehensive, trader-focused report with insights, risks, and actionable ideas, plus a Markdown table at the end.

If you’d like me to proceed now without Reddit data, here’s how I’ll structure the long report and what I’ll cover:

What I will analyze (without Reddit data, but with other sources)
- Executive snapshot
  - Quick read on the current sentiment tone (bullish/bearish/mixed) from non-Reddit sources.
  - Key drivers behind the sentiment (AI/data-center momentum, GPU supply/availability, guidance, product roadmap visibility).

- Daily sentiment scaffolding (without Reddit)
  - Aggregate sentiment signal from X/Twitter mentions, StockTwits chatter, and major financial news headlines for the past 7 days.
  - Common themes: AI adoption, data-center capex, PC gaming demand, competing GPU cycles, supply chain updates, earnings expectations, regulatory considerations.
  - Notable shifts: any days with spikes in chatter around product launches, partnerships, or supply constraints.

- Company news highlights (past week)
  - Any earnings-related updates, guidance changes, new product announcements, partnerships, supply-chain news, or regulatory/antitrust signals.
  - How these news items might affect sentiment and near-term price action (catalysts vs. overhangs).

- Market context and macro factors
  - AI/cloud spending trends, datacenter waiting lists, GPU price/availability signals, and equity market mood for semis.
  - Competitive positioning: AMD vs. Nvidia vs. Intel in key segments (datacenter accelerators, client GPUs, etc.), and any notable pipeline milestones.

- Price action and risk signals
  - Interpretation of recent price moves, volatility, and typical AMD reactions to AI/semis anchors.
  - Key risk factors: supply chain variability, data-center demand shifts, competitive dynamics, product delays, or macro shocks.

- Trading implications and scenarios
  - Bullish scenario: catalysts that could drive outperformance (e.g., stronger AI datacenter demand, favorable product cycle commentary, raised guidance).
  - Bearish scenario: catalysts or signals that could pressure shares (e.g., soft data-center spend, negative product-cycle news, margin pressure, valuation compression).
  - Tiered action ideas: swing trading setups, risk-defined ideas, and horizon-based considerations.

- Data and methodology notes
  - How sentiment signals are weighted, limitations of non-Reddit sources, and how I’d integrate Reddit sentiment once the tool is available again.

Appendix: Draft data-organization table (to be filled once data is gathered)
- Source | Date | Topic | Sentiment (Bullish/Bearish/Mixed) | Narrative Highlights | Potential Price/Volatility Implications | Notes

Proposed Markdown table (to be appended at the end of the final report)
- I’ll populate a concise, readable table with the key takeaways, sources, sentiment, and implications.

How would you like to proceed?
- If you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, I can attempt again and then deliver the full, Reddit-inclusive long report.
- If you’re okay with proceeding now using non-Reddit sources, I’ll generate the comprehensive AMD sentiment-and-news report as described above and include the Markdown table at the end.

Please choose Option A or Option B, or tell me to proceed with a hybrid approach (retry after a short interval while starting the non-Reddit analysis).
