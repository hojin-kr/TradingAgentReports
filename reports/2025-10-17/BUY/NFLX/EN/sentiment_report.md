Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit sentiment for NFLX on 2025-10-17 but I'm hitting a FileNotFoundError from the data provider behind the get_reddit_stock_info tool. It looks like a temporary backend/glue issue. I can retry, but in the meantime I can still deliver a thorough plan and a placeholder-ready report, so you have something concrete to reference as soon as the data tool comes back up.

What I can do now (without the Reddit feed yet)
- Provide a rigorous framework for NFLX sentiment, social media signals, and recent news analysis tailored for traders.
- Outline the exact data points I’ll extract (days-by-day sentiment, top topics, engagement metrics, notable spikes) and how I’ll translate them into actionable insights.
- Deliver a complete report with a Markdown table at the end, populated with placeholders where the Reddit sentiment data will go once the tool is back.

Recommended next steps (once the tool is available again)
- I’ll pull the latest Reddit stock chatter for NFLX for 2025-10-17 (and neighboring days if helpful) and fill in:
  - Daily sentiment scores (positive/negative/neutral)
  - Volume of posts mentioning NFLX
  - Top keywords and topics driving sentiment
  - Notable threads and perceived catalysts (e.g., content strategy, pricing, platform features, outages)
  - Any clear divergence between Reddit sentiment and mainstream news sentiment
- I’ll combine that with a scan of recent company news to assess where sentiment aligns or diverges from corporate events, guidance, or macro factors.

Provisional structure of the long report (you’ll get a fully populated version once the Reddit data is in)

  - High-level sentiment direction (positive/neutral/negative) from Reddit over the past 7 days

  - Specific data-backed triggers that would shift the stance (e.g., sentiment breakouts, divergent news, subscriber guidance changes)

How to proceed
- If you’d like me to continue now, I can proceed with Option 1: a qualitative, data-light analysis that lays out the framework, major risk factors, and trader-oriented takeaways using general industry context (without the day-by-day Reddit data). This will still be valuable for framing trades and risk.
- Or Option 2: wait until the Reddit data tool is restored, and I’ll deliver the fully populated, day-by-day sentiment report with the Markdown table filled in.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to proceed with Option 1 right away, I’ll deliver the detailed qualitative analysis and the structured report (with placeholders clearly labeled) so you can review immediately. If you’d rather wait, I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch and then provide the complete, data-driven version as soon as the tool is available.
