I tried to fetch NFLX data to run the indicators you asked for, but the data tool returned a file-not-found error. I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with a methodology-focused analysis based on the indicators you want to monitor. If you’d like, I’ll attempt the data retrieval again now. In the meantime, here’s a concise, non-data-dependent plan with the 8 most relevant indicators for NFLX and why they fit a typical Netflix-trading context.

Selected indicators (8 total) and why they’re useful for NFLX
- close_50_sma
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  - Why for NFLX: Helps identify whether the stock is in a broader uptrend or downtrend; useful for filtering entries in choppy price action around earnings or guidance updates.

- close_200_sma
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark; golden/death cross context
  - Why for NFLX: Provides a strategic, higher-level trend read. A price above 200 SMA supports a constructive macro view; a cross below can indicate a shift in the longer-term regime.

- close_10_ema
  - Role: Responsive short-term momentum
  - Why for NFLX: Captures quick shifts around catalysts (earnings, subscriber metrics, content news). Useful for tighter entries/exits when combined with bigger trend signals.

- macd
  - Role: Momentum/trend-change signal via MACD line
  - Why for NFLX: Helps identify potential trend changes and confirm strength or fading momentum, especially after volatility spikes.

- macds
  - Role: MACD Signal line
  - Why for NFLX: Crossovers with the MACD line add another layer to confirm or question MACD-driven signals, reducing false positives in range-bound periods.

- rsi
  - Role: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold context
  - Why for NFLX: Useful for spotting potential reversals when momentum extremes appear, especially after sharp moves post-earnings or guidance events.

- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - Role: Dynamic baseline (20 SMA) for price relative to a volatility-enabled framework
  - Why for NFLX: Helps assess breakout vs mean-reversion tendencies around the 20-period baseline; works well when price hugs or crosses the middle line during consolidation or breakout phases.

- atr
  - Role: Volatility measure for risk management
  - Why for NFLX: Guides position sizing and stop placement in the face of shifting volatility (e.g., around earnings or content-release windows).

Note on current data: I don’t have the actual values to describe NFLX’s present trend right now because the data retrieval step failed. Once I can fetch the data, I will compute these indicators and provide a granular trend/trade view (including exact crossovers, levels, and signal strength).

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry fetching NFLX data for a recent window (e.g., last 1–2 years) and compute all eight indicators now?
- If you have a preferred date range (e.g., last 6 months, last earnings period), share it and I’ll tailor the analysis to that window.
- If you’d prefer a slightly different set (e.g., swap close_50_sma for vwma for volume-adjusted trend, or include boll_ub/boll_lb for explicit breakout signals), I can adjust accordingly.

Proposed interpretation framework once data is available
- Trend check: 
  - Price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA → bullish interim and long-term alignment; look for pullbacks to 50 SMA as potential entries in uptrends.
  - Price near/below 50 SMA with price below 200 SMA → caution; consider hedging or waiting for a clear reversal signal.
- Momentum filters:
  - MACD line crossing above zero and MACD line crossing above MACD signal → momentum build to the upside; opposite signals suggest risk-off.
  - RSI rising through 50 toward 70 or approaching/overreaching 70 → monitor for overbought conditions; look for divergences with price.
- Volatility and risk:
  - ATR rising → expect wider price swings; adjust stops and position sizes accordingly.
  - Price trading near or beyond Bollinger Middle with increased band width → potential breakout phase; confirm with MACD/RSI.
- Entry/exit scaffolding:
  - When price trades above 50 SMA and MACD bullish while RSI remains within 40–70, consider favorable long setups with ATR-based stop distance.
  - When price closes below 200 SMA with MACD bearish and RSI turning under 50, consider cautious short-side or reducing exposure.

Draft table for quick reference
Indicator | Role | Signals to watch | Why it helps for NFLX
- close_50_sma | Trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price crossing above/below 50 SMA; potential cross with 200SMA | Confirms mid-term trend and supports entries around pullbacks
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above/below 200 SMA; possible golden/death cross with 50SMA | Long-horizon trend context; helps strategic allocation
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above/below 10 EMA; quick crossovers with price | Timely read on momentum shifts around catalysts
- macd | Momentum/trend-change | MACD line crosses MACD signal; MACD crosses zero | Early momentum change signals, complements price action
- macds | Momentum filter | MACD Signal line cross with MACD line; cross with zero | Reduces false positives from MACD alone
- rsi | Momentum strength | RSI overbought >70; oversold <30; potential divergences | Reversal risk signals, helps with timing near peaks/troughs
- boll | Baseline with volatility context | Price interacts with Bollinger Middle; use with bands for breakouts | Provides a volatility-aware baseline and mean-reversion cues
- atr | Volatility/risk management | ATR rising/falling; configure stop distances accordingly | Dynamic risk controls during earnings and catalyst events

If you want, I can:
- Retry the data fetch now and produce a full indicator-ready report with actual values.
- Or adjust the indicator set (e.g., replace close_50_sma with vwma for volume-confirmed trends) and run the analysis on your preferred window.
