I attempted to fetch Reddit sentiment data for QQQ, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all requests (both in parallel and individually). That means I currently can’t access Reddit data through the provided tool right now. I can still proceed with a thorough analysis using alternative sources (e.g., other social media channels, public news coverage, ETF-level data) and lay out a comprehensive framework you can use once Reddit access is restored.

Here’s a plan for moving forward and a detailed draft of the report you’ll get once Reddit data is available, plus a placeholder table you can review and customize.

What I can do now (alternative sources)
- Gather sentiment signals from non-Reddit sources:
  - X/Twitter sentiment around QQQ and top holdings within the NASDAQ-100
  - StockTwits chatter and ETF-specific discussions
  - Public media coverage (CNBC, Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance articles)
  - ETF-related flows, holdings commentary from Invesco (the QQQ sponsor) and any index provider notes
- Compile recent company/news catalysts that typically move QQQ (AI/manufacturing tech earnings, macro policy expectations, rate trajectory, geopolitical news, regulatory developments)
- Synthesize a daily/weekly sentiment portrait and contextualize it with notable events
- Deliver a long-form report with fine-grained insights for traders and investors, including implications and potential trading considerations

Proposed outline for the long report (to be populated with data as available)
- Executive snapshot
  - Brief read on current sentiment and news catalysts
  - High-level implications for traders (short-term moves, volatility, sector rotation)
- Data landscape
  - Data sources used (X/Twitter, StockTwits, news wires, ETF flows, holdings)
  - Any data quality notes or caveats
- Daily sentiment analysis (past 7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment tilt (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Notable social media themes (AI hype, chipmakers, cloud providers, etc.)
  - Any divergence between social sentiment and known price/volatility moves
- News and catalyst synthesis
  - Key earnings, regulatory, macro, and geopolitical events affecting tech exposure and QQQ holdings
  - Implications of these events for near-term performance and risk
- Holdings and structural drivers
  - Top constituents of QQQ and their recent sentiment/news narrative
  - How shifts in mega-cap behavior (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta) might skew ETF sentiment
- Macro backdrop and macro-led risk
  - Interest rate expectations, inflation narrative, and their impact on tech equities
  - Sector rotation tendencies around rate-change cycles
- Trading implications and ideas
  - Short-term (days to weeks): potential entry/exit signals based on sentiment vs. price action
  - Medium-term (weeks to months): trend continuation vs. mean-reversion risks
  - Risk management considerations (volatility, liquidity, event risk)
- Limitations and data gaps
  - Explicit note about the missing Reddit data and how it might affect interpretation
  - Plans to update once Reddit data is restored
- Appendix
  - Data sources, glossary of sentiment signals, and methodology notes

Draft narrative elements you can expect (qualitative)
- Sentiment tilts tend to mirror tech sector dynamics and macro policy expectations. If macro concerns abate and tech earnings surprises are positive, sentiment around QQQ often strengthens despite broader market noise.
- ETF-level sentiment is typically driven by mega-cap constituents. Positive developments around Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and other large holdings can disproportionately lift QQQ sentiment, even if broader momentum is mixed.
- The interplay between hype (AI, cloud, cybersecurity) and actual earnings resilience in top holdings will be a recurring theme. Traders should watch for divergence between social sentiment spikes and actual price/volatility moves as a potential setup.
- Risk flags to monitor include rate surprise (upward drift in yields), regulatory scrutiny on big tech, supply chain constraints in semiconductors, and geopolitical tensions impacting global tech demand.

Markdown table (key points at a glance)
- This table is designed to summarize the report once data is filled in. I’ve included placeholder values indicating where you’ll see concrete data.

| Section | What to capture | Current status (as of now) | Key Observables to monitor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Sources | List of sentiment sources (X, StockTwits, news wires, ETFs flows, etc.) | Reddit data unavailable (tool error) | Confirm Reddit tool availability; add alternative social sources |
| Daily Sentiment (7 days) | Day-by-day sentiment tilt (positive/neutral/negative) | N/A (pending data) | Daily sentiment drift vs. price action and volatility |
| News/Catalysts | Key headlines affecting tech sector and QQQ components | N/A | Earnings, macro events, policy shifts, regulatory news |
| Holdings Impact | Mega-cap drivers (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, etc.) | N/A | Which holdings are driving sentiment most this period |
| Macro Backdrop | Rate expectations, inflation, global growth signals | N/A | Any shift in rate expectations or inflation prints aligning with sentiment |
| Trading Implications | Short-term setup, medium-term view, risk controls | N/A | Entry/exit ideas, stop levels, hedging considerations |
| Limitations | Data gaps (Reddit), methodology notes | N/A | Plan to refresh once Reddit data is back |

Next steps and options
- I can retry Reddit sentiment data retrieval as soon as the tool is available again, or we can run the analysis entirely with non-Reddit sources and clearly mark data gaps.
- If you’d like, I can start populating the report using non-Reddit sentiment sources right away and deliver a summarized version now, followed by a detailed, appendix-rich version once Reddit data returns.
- Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
  1) Retry Reddit data retrieval now and wait for results (I’ll incorporate them as soon as they come in).
  2) Move ahead with the non-Reddit data to produce a complete interim report.
  3) Wait for a specific date to retry Reddit data and then finalize the full report.

Would you like me to proceed with option 2 (non-Reddit data now) or retry Reddit data immediately once the tool is available? If you have any preferred alternative sources (e.g., specify X/Twitter accounts, StockTwits channels, or particular news outlets), tell me and I’ll prioritize them.
