Apologies for the hiccup. I attempted to fetch Yahoo Finance data for QQQ (2024-10-17 to 2025-10-17) and run the indicator analyses, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError. This seems to be a temporary environment issue with the data source. I can retry fetching the data now or as soon as you’d like. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a robust, non-redundant indicator setup and a plan for producing a detailed, nuanced report once the data is available.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale for QQQ
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps determine the prevailing trend and potential pullback zones in a tech-heavy Nasdaq ETF.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark and trend confirmation (golden/death cross context). Useful for strategic bias and to avoid overtrading in secular trends.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum gauge to capture quick shifts and potential entry/exit points. Complements the slower SMAs by offering faster signals.
- macd: Momentum and trend-change indicator. MACD crossovers can signal shifts in market tone; useful in combination with price action relative to SMAs.
- macds: MACD Signal line. Crossover with MACD provides a more actionable trigger and helps filter false signals.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences ahead of price moves; adds a nuanced view of momentum acceleration/deceleration.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and divergence signals. Helps identify potential reversals, especially in extended tech rallies or pullbacks.
- atr: Volatility measure for risk management. Guides position sizing and stop placement in a high-volatility environment typical of tech-led markets.

Why this set is well-suited for QQQ right now
- The mix balances trend (50/200 SMAs), momentum (MACD trio plus RSI), and risk management (ATR). This is important for QQQ, which often experiences rapid regime changes driven by tech earnings, rate expectations, and macro news.
- By avoiding redundancy (e.g., no StochRSI, no Bollinger redundancy), you get complementary insights without conflicting signals.
- The 8 indicators provide a coherent framework: confirm trend with MAs, time entries with MACD/RSI, and manage risk with ATR.

How I’ll proceed once data is available
- Recompute the indicators for the requested window and generate a detailed, nuanced narrative about the current regime (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) with caveats for regime shifts.
- Provide scenario analysis:
  - If price sits above 50 SMA and 200 SMA with rising MACD and positive MACD histogram, plausibly constructive multi-timeframe trend; look for pullback entries near 50 SMA or minor MACD crossovers with RSI confirming momentum.
  - If price tests or crosses below 50 and 200 SMA with deteriorating MACD/MACD histogram and RSI near overbought levels on higher timeframes, emphasize risk-off posture or wait-and-see approach.
  - Use ATR to contextualize stop distances and position sizing in a high-volatility regime typical of tech earnings weeks.
- Deliver a structured report with:
  - A narrative explanation of the current trend, momentum, and volatility regime.
  - Key signals to watch (entry/exit levels, crossovers, RSI divergences, ATR-based stops).
  - A concise bull/bear/range hypothesis with evidence from the 8 indicators.
  - Practical trade ideas (entry criteria, stop placement, profit targets) tailored to QQQ’s characteristics.

Markdown table: Key indicators and their roles
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  How to use: Confirm trend; look for price hovering above with pullbacks near the 50 SMA for potential entries
  Why relevant for QQQ: Tech-heavy ETF sensitive to momentum shifts; 50 SMA helps gauge intermediate trend

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark
  How to use: Assess overall market regime; look for golden cross (50 crossing above 200) or death cross (50 crossing below 200) as context
  Why relevant for QQQ: Helps avoid premature trades during long-term trend changes

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  What it measures: Short-term momentum
  How to use: Track quick shifts in price; use as a trigger alongside longer SMA signals
  Why relevant for QQQ: Nasdaq tech moves can be fast; a fast EMA helps capture early momentum

- Indicator: macd
  What it measures: Momentum/trend-change via EMA differences
  How to use: Look for MACD line cross above/below the signal; confirm with price action relative to SMAs
  Why relevant for QQQ: Commonly used to catch shifts in tech-driven trends

- Indicator: macds
  What it measures: MACD signal line
  How to use: Crossovers with MACD line trigger trades; filter with other indicators to avoid false positives
  Why relevant for QQQ: Adds a smoother decision point to MACD signals

- Indicator: macdh
  What it measures: MACD histogram momentum strength
  How to use: Divergences or widening/narrowing histogram hint momentum acceleration/deceleration
  Why relevant for QQQ: Early warning of momentum changes not yet reflected in price

- Indicator: rsi
  What it measures: Momentum with overbought/oversold signals
  How to use: Thresholds around 70/30; observe for divergences with price and trend confirmation via SMAs
  Why relevant for QQQ: Helps spot potential reversals in a volatile tech environment

- Indicator: atr
  What it measures: Volatility magnitude
  How to use: Use for stop placement and position sizing; adjust risk exposure during high-volatility periods
  Why relevant for QQQ: Tech sector can be highly volatile around earnings and macro news; ATR helps quantify risk
