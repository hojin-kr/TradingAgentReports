I attempted to fetch TSLA data and the related indicators, but the environment returned a FileNotFoundError for the data calls. Specifically, get_YFin_data (and the subsequent indicator calls) failed with “No such file or directory.” I can retry the data fetch now if you’d like, or proceed with a qualitative framework and indicator plan that you can apply once the data is available.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 complementary indicators for TSLA, along with why they’re suitable given TSLA’s typical behavior (high volatility, momentum-driven moves, and mixed trend characteristics). I’ve prioritized diversity (trend, momentum, and volatility) while avoiding redundancy.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it shows: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why TSLA: TSLA often experiences multi-month trend frames; 50-SMA helps identify ongoing trend and potential pullbacks.
  - How to use: Price above 50-SMA suggests bullish bias; price below signals bearish bias; use with other signals for timing.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it shows: Long-term trend benchmark; major support/resistance level and potential golden/death cross context.
  - Why TSLA: Provides a broader backdrop to avoid false entries in volatile swings; helps confirm secular trend direction.
  - How to use: Alignment with price movement and other momentum signals strengthens conviction; oppositional moves warrant extra caution.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it shows: Short-term momentum and quicker shifts in trend direction (more responsive than 50/200 SMAs).
  - Why TSLA: TSLA can move quickly on news and catalysts; a fast EMA helps capture early momentum changes.
  - How to use: Crosses of price or other moving averages can signal short-term entries/exits, but in choppy markets should be filtered with longer-term indicators.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it shows: Momentum via differences of EMAs; trend-change signals from MACD line dynamics.
  - Why TSLA: Helps detect consolidation breakouts, momentum shifts, and divergence with price in a high-volatility stock.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossovers, centerline crossing, and histogram behavior to gauge momentum strength and potential reversals.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it shows: The EMA-smoothed MACD line; acts as a trigger for entries/exits when crossing the MACD line.
  - Why TSLA: Adds a confirmation layer to MACD signals, reducing false positives in volatile periods.
  - How to use: MACD vs MACD Signal crossovers can confirm entries; use alongside price/RSI context.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it shows: The gap between MACD and its signal; momentum strength visualizer; can diverge before price.
  - Why TSLA: Divergences between MACD Histogram and price can pre-empt reversals in momentum, which is valuable in TSLA’s swings.
  - How to use: Expanding histogram supports continuation bets; shrinking/negative histogram can warn of waning momentum.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it shows: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why TSLA: Helps flag extremes and potential reversals; TSLA often stays overbought/oversold longer in strong trends, so divergence checks with trend context are helpful.
  - How to use: Watch for 70/30 thresholds and bullish/bearish divergences; confirm with trend direction from moving averages and MACD.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it shows: Volatility level; average true range to gauge daily range and risk.
  - Why TSLA: High-volatility stock; ATR is essential for setting stop levels and for sizing positions in a volatile environment.
  - How to use: Use ATR to place stops at a multiple of recent volatility; adjust position sizing as volatility expands or contracts.

Notes on approach and interpretation
- The combination focuses on:
  - Trend confirmation (50 SMA, 200 SMA, 10 EMA)
  - Momentum and signal confirmation (MACD family + RSI)
  - Volatility and risk management (ATR)
- This set avoids relying on a single signal set, which is important for TSLA’s often noisy price action.
- If you plan to add a volatility-based or volume-based indicator later, Bollinger bands or VWMA could be considered, but I’ve kept the list to 8 to maintain complementary coverage with minimal redundancy.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data and generate a full, data-driven report with these exact indicators as soon as the data pipeline is available.
- If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a purely qualitative interpretation framework now (based on typical TSLA behavior) and then plug in actual values once the data is retrieved.

Markdown table: key indicators and rationale
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | Why it’s suitable for TSLA | How to interpret (signals) |
|-----------|----------|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Captures mid-range trend in a volatile stock; helps avoid false signals from short spikes | Price above/below 50-SMA indicates bullish/bearish bias; confirm with MACD/RSI |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark and major support/resistance | Provides macro-trend context for TSLA’s swings; good for alignment with longer cycles | Price above/below 200-SMA suggests long-term trend; look for golden/death cross with other signals |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum and quick shifts | Sensitive to rapid moves around catalysts; helps with timely entries | Price/other indicators crossing above/below 10-EMA signals potential short-term entries/exits (filter with longer MA) |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via MACD line dynamics; trend-change signals | Helps identify shifts in momentum during TSLA’s volatile moves | Bullish/bearish cross of MACD line with zero line; confirm with MACD histogram and price action |
| macds | MACD Signal | Signal line crossovers | Reduces false positives by requiring MACD vs its signal to align | MACD crosses above/below MACD Signal can trigger entries/exits when supported by price and RSI |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence | Divergence between histogram and price can hint at impending reversals | Expanding histogram supports continuation; shrinking/negative histogram warns of momentum loss |
| rsi | Momentum Indicator | Relative momentum, overbought/oversold cues | Helps identify reversal risk in overextended moves; divergence with price is informative | RSI >70 overbought or <30 oversold; watch for bullish/bearish divergences combined with trend context |
| atr | Volatility | Measures market volatility and helps with risk management | TSLA’s swings require dynamic stops and position sizing | Higher ATR suggests wider stops; use ATR multiples for stop placement; adjust size with volatility |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and then produce a detailed, data-driven report using these 8 indicators, including trend interpretations, potential entry/exit cues, and risk management guidelines based on the latest TSLA data. Please tell me whether to retry immediately or proceed with the qualitative plan.
