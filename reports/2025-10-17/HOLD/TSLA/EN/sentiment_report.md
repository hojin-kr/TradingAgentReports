I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock info for TSLA on 2025-10-17, but the tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can retry, but I don’t want to delay your analysis if you’d prefer to move forward with other sources.

Here’s how I can proceed next, depending on your preference:

Option A — Retry Reddit data fetch now
- I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again for TSLA on 2025-10-17 and then build the full report with day-by-day sentiment, key themes, and notable posts.
- If the tool returns the same error, I’ll switch to an alternative data source plan (Option B).

Option B — Proceed with a plan that uses alternative sources
- I’ll generate a comprehensive long-form report focusing on:
  - Sentiment framework: high-level daily sentiment categories (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative) and inferred momentum.
  - Public signals from other platforms (where available): Twitter/X vibes, stock forums (e.g., StockTwits), and major news headlines from the past week.
  - Thematic drivers: demand trends for EVs (Model Y/3), energy/business unit dynamics, margins, FSD/robotaxi progress, supply chain notes, regulatory impact, and competition.
  - Notable events in the past week: any Tesla announcements, price actions, production updates, or partnerships.
  - Risk and trade implications: how sentiment shifts could affect short-term moves, implied volatility considerations, and scenario-based outlook (bullish, neutral, bearish).
  - Trader-oriented takeaways: entry/exit ideas, risk controls, and watchpoints.
- I’ll append a Makrdown table at the end to organize key points in a concise, readable format.

If you want me to proceed immediately with Option A (retry the Reddit data fetch now), say “Retry now.” If you’d prefer Option B (proceed with alternative sources and the full structured report), say “Proceed with plan B.”

Additionally, if you have a preferred scope (e.g., include only X platform data, or focus on specific TSLA aspects like EV demand vs. energy division), tell me and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.
