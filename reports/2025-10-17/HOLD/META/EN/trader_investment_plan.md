Recommendation: Buy META, but with a disciplined, staged entry that requires explicit ROI milestones before increasing size.

Rationale
- The bull case hinges on AI infrastructure translating into higher ARPU and broader monetization (ads across core apps plus commerce/messaging). If ROI materializes within a reasonable horizon, META can re-rate on earnings power and free cash flow, supported by buybacks and balance-sheet strength.
- Near-term risks are real (capex cash burn, ad-market cycles, regulatory headwinds, and metaverse exposure). These are manageable only if ROAS/ARPU improvements become verifiable and durable across multiple products.
- Governance and optionality (diversified revenue streams beyond ads) provide downside protection, but they don’t replace the need for measurable monetization progress.

Strategic actions (concrete steps)
- Phased entry: initiate with 1/3 of the intended META exposure at or near current levels. Plan to add a second tranche upon confirming ROI milestones, then a final tranche after sustained ARPU/ROAS improvements across at least two major ad products.
- Position sizing and risk limits: cap total META exposure (e.g., no more than 10% of the stock sleeve in META over the next 3–6 months) and enforce a hard stop (e.g., -12% to -15% from entry) to guard against downside surprise.
- ROI milestones to validate the bull case:
  - Short term (2–4 quarters): visible ARPU uplift attributable to AI features, improved ROAS per region/product, and measurable contributions from commerce/messaging monetization beyond core ads.
  - Medium term (4–8 quarters): sustained ARPU growth across multiple apps, improved gross margins from AI efficiency, and evidence of scale benefits from the LA/TX data-centers.
- Catalysts to watch and response:
  - AI feature rollouts delivering ROAS improvements: consider adding to the position if improvements are sustained.
  - Capex progress: monitor on-time spend and ROI contribution; overruns or delays trigger reassessment.
  - Regulatory/news flow: adjust exposure or hedge if risk rises materially.
  - Earnings/GS guidance tying revenue growth to AI ROI: positive signals should accelerate exposure; vague guidance warrants caution.
- Risk controls and hedges:
  - Follow-on rule: only add if there are sustained, verifiable ARPU/ROAS improvements tied to AI across at least two major ad products.
  - Optionality: consider limited-cost call options to participate in upside without full capital outlay.
  - Diversification: keep META within a diversified tech/ad-growth sleeve to avoid concentration risk.
- Review cadence: quarterly ROI milestone reviews; adjust exposure if ROI signals lag meaningfully or if capital-allocation progress stalls.

What could change the view
- If ROAS/ARPU improvements are not visible within the next 4–8 quarters, reconsider exposure size or pause further increments.
- If capex overruns or a sustained deterioration in core ad demand occurs, recalibrate expectations and the staged plan promptly.

Bottom line
- The plan you provided essentially argues for a strategic BUY with disciplined, milestone-driven deployment and risk controls. Given the potential upside from AI-enabled monetization against the backdrop of near-term capex drag and regulatory risk, a staged BUY with clear milestones is the prudent stance.
