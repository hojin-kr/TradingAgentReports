Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch META data via get_YFin_data, but I’m currently facing a backend error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This means I can’t pull the actual price data right now to compute and interpret the indicators. I can still outline exactly what I’ll do and prepare a robust plan, so you’re ready to review as soon as the data retrieval is back online. If you’d like, I can retry automatically in a moment or you can give me the go-ahead to proceed with the indicator framework and interpretation once the data is available.

Indicators I will use (8 total, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these 8 are suitable for META (current context)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance and helps confirm the prevailing trend when combined with other signals.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for assessing strategic trend strength and for golden/death cross considerations with the 50-SMA.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum capture; responds quickly to price changes, helping to spot early entries or shifts when used with longer-term averages.
- macd: Core momentum/trend-change signal; MACD crossovers and divergences help identify shifts in momentum in conjunction with price action.
- macds: MACD Signal line; crossovers with MACD provide filtered entry/exit signals, reducing false positives when used with other indicators.
- macdh: MACD Histogram; visualizes momentum strength and potential divergence; useful for early warning of momentum changes ahead of MACD line crossovers.
- rsi: Momentum strength and potential reversal signals (overbought/oversold thresholds and divergences). Helps contextualize momentum in the trend framework.
- atr: Volatility-based risk management; informs position sizing and stop placement, and complements price-based signals by signaling changing risk conditions.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A nuanced, trend-focused report that blends trend (MA crossovers and price vs MAs), momentum (MACD trio and RSI), and volatility/risk (ATR). It will:
  - Identify the primary trend direction and potential trend changes (via 50/200 SMA and 10 EMA in relation to price).
  - Flag momentum shifts through MACD components and RSI, with a focus on confirmations/divergences.
  - Highlight volatility context and risk management considerations using ATR.
  - Provide practical takeaways for entry/exit decisions, stop placement, and position sizing, with explicit scenarios (e.g., “bullish momentum with rising ATR suggests higher tolerance for wider stops”).
  - Include a structured, trader-friendly interpretation of mixed signals (e.g., price above the 50 and 200 SMAs but RSI overbought and ATR increasing).

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval automatically if you’d like, or you can re-run the data fetch on your end and then I’ll produce the full, detailed report with the 8 indicators and the final Markdown table.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance (to be populated with actual data later)
- Indicator
- What it measures
- How to interpret signals (buy/sell hints)
- Trade considerations (entries, exits, risk management)
- Notes (any caveats or context)

Here is the table skeleton I will fill in once data is available (to be completed with META data in the same format):

| Indicator | What it measures | Interpretation hints (buy/sell) | Trade considerations | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | … | … | … |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend, trend confirmation, golden/death cross context | … | … | … |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum shifts | … | … | … |
| macd | Momentum/trend-change signal | … | … | … |
| macds | MACD signal line crossovers | … | … | … |
| macdh | MACD histogram momentum strength/divergence | … | … | … |
| rsi | Relative strength; overbought/oversold and divergences | … | … | … |
| atr | Market volatility and risk context | … | … | … |

If you’d like me to proceed with a fallback approach (e.g., using a cached or proxy data source) or if you want to retry now, tell me and I’ll proceed accordingly. I’ll ensure the final, fully-annotated report, including the completed Markdown table, is delivered as soon as the data fetch succeeds.
