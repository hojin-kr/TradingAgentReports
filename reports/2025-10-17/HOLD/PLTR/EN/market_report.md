I attempted to fetch PLTR data and compute the requested indicators, but the data tools returned a FileNotFoundError (environment issue with the data files). I can retry when the data backend is back online or if you’d like me to try a different date window or source. In the meantime, here is a detailed, trader-oriented framework for PLTR using a complementary 8-indicator setup. Once the data retrieval works, I will populate precise values, cross-check signals, and deliver a concrete, end-to-end analysis.

What I would run (8 complementary indicators)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  - What it tells you: medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to read PLTR: price trading above 50 SMA suggests a bullish intermediate-term tilt; price below indicates potential weakness or a choppier phase.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  - What it tells you: long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major regime shifts.
  - How to read PLTR: price above 200 SMA tends to align with a bullish longer-term trend; price below implies a dominant downtrend or consolidation phase.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  - What it tells you: responsive, short-term momentum.
  - How to read PLTR: price crossing above the 10 EMA can signal a quick bullish kick; crossing below can signal a short-term pullback or onset of weakness. Use with longer-term MA for filtering noise.
- macd: MACD line
  - What it tells you: momentum and potential trend changes via EMA differences.
  - How to read PLTR: MACD crossing above the signal line is a bullish cue; crossing below is bearish. Positive MACD histogram supports bullish momentum; negative histogram supports bearish momentum.
- macds: MACD Signal line
  - What it tells you: smoothing of MACD to confirm triggers.
  - How to read PLTR: MACD crossing the MACDs line is a more confirmed entry/exit signal when aligned with price action and RSI.
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  - What it tells you: momentum strength and potential divergences.
  - How to read PLTR: expanding positive histogram confirms strengthening upside momentum; expanding negative histogram confirms downside momentum. Divergence with price can warn of a potential reversal.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index
  - What it tells you: momentum strength and potential reversal zones (overbought/oversold).
  - How to read PLTR: RSI near or above 70 can indicate overbought conditions in a rising market; near or below 30 can indicate oversold conditions in a falling market. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for longer; look for bearish/bullish divergences and confluence with MA/MACD signals.
- atr: Average True Range
  - What it tells you: market volatility and risk context.
  - How to read PLTR: rising ATR implies higher volatility, which affects stop placement and position sizing. Use ATR-based stops to align risk with current market conditions; lower ATR suggests narrower moves and potentially tighter stops.

How I’d interpret signals in a PLTR context (once data is available)
- Trend framework (50 SMA and 200 SMA)
  - If PLTR price sits consistently above both the 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with a potential bullish cross (e.g., 50 SMA above 200 SMA), the bias would be bullish for the medium-to-long term.
  - If PLTR price is pressing the 50 SMA from above or below, use the 50 SMA as a dynamic support/resistance zone. A break under 50 SMA in a broader uptrend could suggest a shallow pullback; a break above after a retest would confirm continuation.
- Momentum framework (MACD family and RSI)
  - bullish scenario: MACD line > MACDs, MACD histogram turning positive or expanding; RSI climbing but not yet in overbought extreme; price above 50/200 SMA and price above 10 EMA.
  - caution scenario: MACD turning negative while price remains above key MA levels, or MACD histogram shows fading momentum; RSI diverges (price makes a new high but RSI fails to exceed prior high) or RSI approaches 70/overbought in an already extended upmove.
  - RSI behavior in PLTR context: in choppy markets, RSI can whipsaw; prefer signals confirmed by MA alignment and MACD momentum.
- Volatility context (ATR)
  - Rising ATR with price consolidation can indicate potential breakout risk; use ATR-based stops to avoid premature exits on volatility spikes.
  - Falling ATR during a steady trend implies smoother moves, allowing tighter stops and smaller trailing risk.
- Composite read
  - Favorable setup: price above 50/200 SMAs, MACD bullish with positive histogram, RSI non-overbought or showing a constructive bullish divergence, ATR rising but with a confirmed breakout pattern (e.g., price breaking out of a consolidation with volume).
  - Caution/neutral setup: price near/under 50 SMA or 200 SMA with mixed MACD signals and RSI not in extreme overbought/oversold zones; risk management becomes the priority.
  - Bearish setup: price breaking below 50 SMA and 200 SMA, negative MACD signals with histogram contraction, RSI failing to hold above 50, ATR rising on downside moves (heightened risk).

Practical next steps (when data retrieval succeeds)
- Fetch daily price data for PLTR for the desired window (e.g., last 12–18 months) and compute the 8 indicators listed above.
- Generate a signal synthesis:
  - Trend verdict (bullish/neutral/bearish) based on MA alignment and price position relative to MAs.
  - Momentum verdict from MACD series and RSI with attention to divergences.
  - Volatility and risk controls from ATR.
- Provide explicit entry/exit ideas:
  - Entry signals when price is above 50/200 SMA, MACD bullish, RSI not overbought, and a constructive ATR read.
  - Stop-loss placement using a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR from entry) and trailing stops as ATR evolves.
  - Position sizing guidance using ATR-based volatility to maintain consistent risk per trade.
- Deliver a structured report with:
  - Executive summary
  - Indicator-by-indicator analysis
  - Signals matrix (entry/exit/stop)
  - Risk controls and contingency notes
  - A concise conclusion with the recommended stance (BUY/HOLD/SELL) if the data aligns with the setup (I will clearly label the final stance if desired by you).

Request to proceed

Markdown table: Key indicators and their roles for PLTR
| Indicator | What it measures | Signal interpretation | PLTR-specific notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above = bullish bias; below = bearish bias | Use with price action around support/resistance for entries/exits |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above = potential long-term uptrend; below = long-term downtrend | Golden/death-cross context if cross with 50 SMA occurs |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price cross above = near-term bullish momentum; cross below = near-term bearish momentum | Helpful for early entries when aligned with longer MA signals |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD line > signal = bullish momentum; cross-back = potential reversal | Confirm with price action and RSI to avoid false positives in choppy markets |
| macds | MACD signal line | Cross of MACD with MACDS strengthens or weakens the move | Use in conjunction with histogram for momentum strength |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Histogram rising = strengthening momentum; falling = weakening | Divergence with price can foreshadow reversals |
| rsi | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | >70 overbought; <30 oversold; consider divergences | In strong trends, extreme RSI can persist; confirm with trend signals |
| atr | Market volatility | Rising ATR = higher volatility; stopping/risk-adjustment advised | Use ATR for stops and position sizing; less effective for entry timing |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching data now and then deliver a full, data-backed PLTR report with the 8 indicators populated, signal synthesis, and a clear BUY/HOLD/SELL stance based on the results.
