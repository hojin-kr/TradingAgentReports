Recommendation: HOLD PLTR for now.

Rationale:
- The plan you provided emphasizes meaningful, hard-to-ignore risks around government concentration, monetization speed in commercial segments, and a high valuation. Those risks remain salient, and near-term durability of ARR growth and margin expansion has not been clearly demonstrated.
- A cautious stance remains prudent given potential policy/procurement headwinds, macro softness, and the possibility that cross-sell momentum and profitability may take longer to materialize than anticipated.
- The bull case—longer-term AI governance platform growth and cross-sell potential—still exists, but requires durable evidence (sustainable ARR acceleration, stronger renewals, and margin uplift) to justify higher exposure.

Key conditions to upgrade to BUY:
- Clear, measurable ARR growth acceleration with improving gross and operating margins as commercial mix thickens.
- Demonstrable cross-sell traction (Snowflake, OneMedNet) with multi-quarter ARR/renewal data showing durable uplift.
- Reduced government concentration risk or policy/geopolitical tailwinds that support discretionary IT budgets.

Key conditions to downgrade to SELL:
- Deterioration in ARR, flat or contracting gross margins, slipping renewal rates, or meaningful weakness in top customer concentration.
- Adverse regulatory headlines or fresh government procurement risk that meaningfully shifts risk-reward.

Positioning and risk controls:
- Keep exposure modest (1-3% of portfolio) and use tight, ATR-based stops on any new entries.
- Consider staged entry: await confirmation signals (price above key moving averages with positive momentum) before adding.
- Use hedging (collar, puts) around known catalyst windows to cap downside while preserving upside in a controlled manner.

What would trigger an upgrade or downgrade:
- Upgrade triggers: sustained ARR growth metrics over consecutive quarters, margin expansion, and clear progress in cross-sell deals with verifiable ARR uplift.
- Downgrade triggers: negative ARR trends, stagnant or deteriorating margins, or fresh government-related risk headlines without offsetting catalysts.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
