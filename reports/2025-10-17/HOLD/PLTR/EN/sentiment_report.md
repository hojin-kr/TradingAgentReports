Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the PLTR Reddit stock news for 2025-10-17, but the Reddit news fetcher returned a backend FileNotFoundError. It looks like the Reddit data tool is temporarily unavailable or misconfigured on the backend right now.

What I can do right now
- Retry now: I can attempt the data pull again if you want me to kick off another fetch immediately.
- Proceed with a robust framework: If you’d prefer not to wait, I can deliver a comprehensive, high-quality framework and methodology for the PLTR sentiment/news analysis, plus a filled-out report template that I’ll complete as soon as the tool comes back online or you provide data from alternative sources.
- Use a fallback plan: I can compile an in-depth analysis based on general market factors, company fundamentals, and typical Reddit sentiment patterns for Palantir while clearly labeling data gaps and assumptions. This would still be useful for traders but would be clearly caveated.

Here’s what I’ll deliver in a full report when the data tool is available (or once you supply data):
- Daily sentiment deltas for the past 7 days on PLTR from Reddit and other social channels (if available), including top themes and spike causes (e.g., product updates, earnings, government contract news).
- Key corroborating news from the week (product launches, government/enterprise wins, regulatory/AI policy context, earnings hints if any, and notable executive comments).
- A synthesis of sentiment vs. price action (where data is available) to infer potential near-term catalysts or risk.
- Risks and hedging considerations for traders (e.g., exposure to government contract cycles, AI demand tailwinds, competition, sentiment-driven pullbacks).
- Implied timeline for potential moves and recommended posture (short-term hedges, liquidity considerations, and event-driven play ideas).
- AMakrdown table at the end with concise, decision-ready points.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with a structured, data-agnostic framework (and clearly mark where data will be plugged in once available), here’s a detailed outline I’ll follow:

1) Executive snapshot
- Quick read on sentiment direction, notable sentiment drivers, and the current narrative around PLTR.
- Any red flags or catalysts appearing in the last week.

2) Social sentiment analysis (Reddit-focused)
- Day-by-day sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative) with brief rationale for major shifts.
- Top recurring themes (Foundry adoption, Apollo usage, Gotham, AI/ML capabilities, pricing concerns, competition).

3) News synthesis (weekly)
- Summary of notable company/news events (new contracts, product updates, partnerships, leadership commentary).
- How these events align with or contradict Reddit sentiment.

4) Market/price context
- Any observable alignment or divergence between sentiment and price action during the week.
- Commentary on volume and volatility signals that traders care about.

5) Catalysts and risk factors
- Near-term catalysts (earnings timing, contract announcements, tech milestones).
- Risks (regulatory shifts, customer concentration, AI market competition, cost structures).

6) Trading implications and scenarios
- If sentiment improves: what trades to consider and risk controls.
- If sentiment deteriorates: defensive positioning and hedges.
- If neutral: ranges, setup patterns, and watch-for-breakouts.

7) Data quality notes
- Clear caveats about data gaps, potential biases (e.g., Reddit skew, sample size), and reliability considerations.

8) Makrdown table
- A concise, reader-friendly table summarizing key insights, catalysts, risks, and actionable ideas.

Would you like me to:
A) Retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
B) Proceed with the data-agnostic, fully fleshed-out framework (so I can deliver the completed report as soon as data comes back or you provide substitutes)?

If you want me to retry, I’ll run another fetch immediately. If you prefer the framework now, I’ll generate the full report skeleton with filled-in sections and placeholders for data points.
