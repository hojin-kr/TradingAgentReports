I tried to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for SPY for 2025-09-08 through 2025-09-14, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all dates (including today). I can (a) retry the Reddit data pull when the tool is available, or (b) switch to alternative sources (e.g., other social platforms, major news outlets) to build the sentiment/story for SPY, or (c) proceed with a structured plan and placeholders until the Reddit data comes back.

Here are options you can choose from, or I can proceed with a combination:

- Option 1: Retry Reddit data now (or as soon as the tool is back) to capture daily sentiment for SPY across 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-14.
- Option 2: Use alternative sources to compile a sentiment and news overview for SPY over the same window (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, major financial news outlets, ETF flows). I can clearly note sources and calibrate sentiment.
- Option 3: Deliver a fully structured long report framework with placeholders for sentiment data, so you can review the approach now and I fill in the actual numbers as soon as the Reddit tool is functional.

If you’d like, I can also proceed with a concise interim view focused on likely drivers for SPY around mid-September 2025 (macro risks, Fed expectations, earnings season posture) without the Reddit data, and then overlay the Reddit-derived sentiment once it’s available.
