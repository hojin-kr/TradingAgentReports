I tried to fetch SPY data and run the 8 indicators, but I hit a data-access error in the environment:

- get_YFin_data returned: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')
- The indicator calls also failed for the same reason.

I can retry the data pull now or as soon as you’re ready. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan and a recommended, non-redundant set of indicators (up to 8) you can rely on once the data fetch succeeds. I’ll also include a nuanced interpretation framework tailored for SPY.

Recommended indicator set (8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these 8 are suitable for SPY
- Moving Averages (50SMA, 200SMA, 10EMA): 
  - 50SMA and 200SMA provide a clear view of medium- and long-term trend context, important for SPY’s broad macro-driven moves.
  - 10EMA adds a responsive read on short-term momentum and can flag quick shifts that may precede larger trend changes.
  - Using both 50/200 helps identify classic trend signals (e.g., golden cross/death cross) and provides levels that often act as dynamic support/resistance.
- MACD family (MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram):
  - Offers momentum insight and trend-change signals in a form that often precedes price moves.
  - Histogram (macdh) helps gauge momentum strength and potential divergences.
- RSI:
  - A robust momentum/overbought-oversold gauge that complements trend signals. Useful for spotting potential reversals or confirming trend strength, especially when used with trend context from the moving averages.
  - Note: In strong trends RSI can remain elevated or depressed for extended periods; cross-check with trend indicators (SMA cross, MACD) for better signals.
- ATR:
  - Volatility-based metric essential for risk management, position sizing, and stop placement.
  - Helps adapt trade management as SPY’s volatility regime shifts, which is common around major macro events or earnings seasons.

What I will do once data is available
- Compute the 8 indicators for SPY with the exact parameters you’ve specified.
- Generate a comprehensive, nuanced trend / signal report that includes:
  - Trend alignment: Are price and all time-frame averages aligned (price above 50SMA and 200SMA, 50SMA above/below 200SMA)?
  - Momentum shifts: MACD line vs signal, MACD histogram strength changes, RSI levels and any divergences.
  - Short-term momentum vs long-term trend: Price vs 10EMA relationship; crossovers and pullbacks.
  - Volatility and risk: ATR-based volatility regime; how wide stop distances should be given current volatility.
  - Potential entry/exit signals: crossovers and thresholds that are corroborated by multiple indicators.
  - Contextual notes: Any notable divergences between price action and indicators, or sector/macroeconomic considerations that could impact SPY.

Proposed interpretation framework (how to read the results together)
- If SPY price is above 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA, and MACD line is above the signal with rising MACD histogram, plus RSI in a non-extreme zone (not overbought, unless supported by momentum), this tends to indicate a strengthening uptrend. Consider continuation entries or adding exposure with risk controls based on ATR.
- If price is near or above all three moving averages but RSI shows overbought conditions and MACD histogram starts to fade, be cautious of a pullback; use ATR to adjust stop distances and reduce position size if volatility stabilizes.
- If ATR rises with price moving sideways and MACD crosses down while RSI begins to turn lower, consider risk-off or hedging strategies; this can precede a consolidation or a potential trend reversal.
- In a high-volatility regime (rising ATR), rely more on longer-dated trend confirmation (50SMA/200SMA alignment) and tighten risk controls; avoid hero trades on small price moves.

Potential risk management notes
- Use ATR to set initial stop distance (e.g., stop ~ 1.5× ATR from entry) and adjust as volatility changes.
- Position sizing should reflect ATR shifts; higher ATR warrants smaller position sizes to maintain risk targets.
- Confirm signals with multiple indicators to reduce false positives in choppy markets.

Next steps
- I can retry the data retrieval and run the 8 indicators as soon as the environment can access the data source.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for SPY | Action signals (example) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend benchmark; dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend; below suggests downtrend | Enter long if price above 50SMA with bullish MACD and RSI not overbought; consider short/size reduction if price below 50SMA |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA indicates bullish macro trend; below indicates bearish | Look for golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) as a bullish setup; death cross as bearish caution |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above 10EMA indicates near-term momentum; crossing below can signal shift | Use with MACD/Rsi for entry/exit; avoid trades when price is choppy near 10EMA |
| macd | Momentum (MACD line vs signal) | MACD above signal with rising histogram signals bullish momentum; cross down signals bearish momentum | Buy when MACD crosses above signal with positive histogram and trend alignment; sell/short when opposite |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Smoothing of MACD; crossovers help confirm signals | Use crossovers with MACD line for entry/exit triggers |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence visibility | Increasing histogram supports continuation; decreasing or negative histogram warns of weakening momentum |
| rsi | Relative strength; momentum | Overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) zones; divergences matter | In uptrends, avoid overbuying unless supported by other signals; look for reversals on divergences or RSI turning down from high levels |
| atr | Market volatility | Higher ATR implies wider price moves; risk management needs adjustment | Set wider stops in high-ATR regimes with caution on position size; tighten in low-ATR regimes or choppy markets |

If you’d like, I can proceed to retry the data fetch now and then deliver the full, polished SPY report with the 8 indicators and the detailed trend analysis as soon as the data is available. Would you like me to retry immediately?
