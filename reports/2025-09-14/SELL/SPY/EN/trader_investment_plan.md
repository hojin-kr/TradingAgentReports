Short answer: SELL SPY.

Rationale:
- Macro regime risk remains elevated: higher-for-longer rate expectations, potential stickier inflation, and discount-rate compression risks for broad multiples.
- Breadth and concentration risk: SPY’s performance is heavily influenced by megacap leadership; a regime shift can hit breadth and liquidity faster than a more diversified exposure.
- Valuation risk under a fragile macro backdrop: even with AI/tech tailwinds, valuation support is not assured if earnings growth slows or sentiment shifts.
- As a result, a risk-controlled stance with hedging and a defensive tilt is more actionable today than adding to a broad SPY core.

Recommendation summary:
- Sell/ materially reduce SPY exposure and hedge rather than increasing SPY allocation. Maintain only a small, long-run anchor if desired, but make SPY a secondary engine of returns.

Implementation plan (concise):
1) Trim SPY core exposure
   - Target a 25–40% reduction of current SPY allocation, preserving a residual core of about 5–10% of the portfolio if you want a long-run market anchor.

2) Implement hedges
   - Use SPY-based downside hedges (protective puts or put spreads) sized to 10–15% of the portfolio’s risk budget with 6–12 months duration.
   - Consider a modest long-vol sleeve or duration-neutral hedge if suitable, to dampen drawdowns.

3) Tilt toward defensive, quality exposure
   - Increase allocation to defensive sectors (healthcare, consumer staples, utilities) and high-quality, cash-generative names.

4) Add inflation-hedged assets
   - Allocate 5–15% to inflation hedges (TIPS, gold, or selective commodities) to diversify macro-risk.

5) Risk controls and discipline
   - Establish explicit sell/trim triggers based on SPY moving-average confluence, breadth deterioration, or widening drawdowns.
   - Use volatility-based sizing (e.g., ATR) for any new equity adds.
   - Cap total capital-at-risk for SPY residual and hedges to prevent outsized drawdowns.

6) Data-driven iteration and monitoring
   - Regularly assess macro indicators and breadth signals.
   - If macro signals improve and breadth strengthens, selectively unwind hedges and rebuild a modest SPY core gradually.

7) Contingency mindset
   - If regime signals improve, re-risk toward SPY with hedges scaled down.
   - If regime risks persist, maintain defensives and inflation hedges with a cautious re-entry plan.

Final note: This approach prioritizes risk management and optionality, aiming to protect on downside while remaining poised for upside if conditions improve. You can adjust the exact hedge sizes and defensive tilts to fit your risk tolerance and constraints.
