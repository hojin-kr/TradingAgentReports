Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock sentiment for NVDA on 2025-09-14, but the tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). It looks like the data source for that date isn’t accessible right now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry the data fetch now (in case the backend hiccup is transient) and pull the latest Reddit sentiment for NVDA on 2025-09-14.
- Try alternate dates (e.g., 2025-09-13 or 2025-09-07) to build a short-week sentiment slice if the exact date is unavailable.
- Proceed with a qualitative, best-available synthesis using publicly known news and sentiment signals (without the exact day-by-day Reddit tally) and clearly flag that the Reddit data pull failed so readers know the limitation.

What would you prefer? If you’d like, I can:
- Retry the Reddit data pull immediately.
- Or switch to a thorough qualitative analysis that covers:
  - Key NVDA news in the past week (earnings hints, product roadmap, supply-chain/regulatory chatter, AI compute demand signals)
  - General social sentiment theme (e.g., excitement around AI adoption vs. concerns about valuation/competition)
  - A day-by-day sentiment narrative (without exact counts) and implications for traders

Additionally, I’ll prepare a detailed long report with:
- Executive snapshot
- Social media sentiment themes (day-by-day narrative)
- Recent news impact
- Sentiment vs. price action interpretation
- Trader implications and risk considerations
- A final Markdown table summarizing key points (organized for quick reference)

Please tell me which path you’d like, and I’ll dive in.
