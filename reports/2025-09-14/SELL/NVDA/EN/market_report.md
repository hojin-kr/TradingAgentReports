I tried to fetch NVDA data but hit a backend error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) when calling the Yahoo Finance data tool. I can retry the fetch, or proceed with an indicator-driven framework now and apply the data as soon as the fetch succeeds. Please tell me if you want me to retry immediately.

In the meantime, here is a carefully selected set of up to 8 indicators designed to give complementary insights for NVDA, which tends to be a high-volatility, momentum-driven stock with strong trend episodes. The goal is to cover trend direction, momentum, and volatility without redundancy.

Recommended 8 indicators (with rationale)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps confirm the ongoing trend when price is above/below this level.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; useful to identify major regime (bullish if price is above, potential trend reversal signals near crossovers with the 50 SMA).
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum gauge; detects quick shifts and potential entry/exit points, especially in fast-moving AI/tech names.
- macd: Momentum trend signal via MACD line crossovers; pairs well with the other trend indicators to confirm changes.
- macds: MACD signal line; its crossovers with MACD provide additional trigger signals and help filter false alarms in choppier periods.
- rsi: Momentum and overbought/oversold conditions; useful for spotting divergences with price and for confirming trend strength or potential reversals.
- boll_ub: Upper Bollinger Band; signals potential overbought zones and breakout pressure; good for spotting momentum squeezes with price expansion.
- boll_lb: Lower Bollinger Band; signals potential oversold zones and downside risk; helps assess downside targets and validity of bullish breakouts when used with other filters.

Notes on how to use them together
- Trend confirmation: Ensure price is above 50_sma and 200_sma for bullish bias; look for a positive MACD cross and MACD signal confirming momentum while RSI trends above 50 but not in extreme overbought zone.
- Momentum validation: Use close_10_ema in conjunction with MACD/macds to identify rapid entry points in uptrends; watch for RSI divergence as a warning sign.
- Volatility and breakout context: Boll_ub and boll_lb will outline expansion/contraction; price testing or breaking the upper band with rising MACD and RSI can indicate a strong continuation, while touching the lower band with bearish divergences can warn of a potential pullback.
- Risk management touchpoints: While ATR (not selected here) is helpful for sizing stops, the Bollinger bands together with ATR-derived stops (if you use ATR in a broader system) can still guide volatility-adjusted entries/exits.

What I’ll deliver once data is retrieved
- A detailed trend narrative for NVDA based on the eight indicators above, including:
  - Current relationship of price to 50_sma and 200_sma (bullish/bearish regime and any crossovers).
  - MACD/macds/macdh signals and how they align with RSI and price action.
  - RSI levels and any divergences vs. price.
  - Bollinger band structure (price vs. upper/lower bands) and what it implies about volatility and breakout potential.
  - Integrated entry/exit / risk ideas with example scenarios.

Markdown table: key indicators, role, and interpretation
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Interpretation: Price above 50_sma suggests uptrend; price below suggests downtrend; use as a baseline filter for entries.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Role: Long-term trend benchmark | Interpretation: Price above 200_sma indicates long-term bullish regime; crossovers with 50_sma can signal longer-term shifts.
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Role: Short-term momentum capture | Interpretation: Price above/below 10_ema signals near-term momentum shifts; use to time entries with other confirmations.
- Indicator: macd | Role: Momentum trend signal (MACD line vs. signal) | Interpretation: Positive MACD cross above signal supports bullish momentum; negative cross supports bearish momentum.
- Indicator: macds | Role: MACD signal line | Interpretation: Crossovers with MACD line help refine buy/sell signals and reduce false positives when combined with other indicators.
- Indicator: rsi | Role: Momentum strength and reversal potential | Interpretation: RSI rising toward overbought (>70) or falling toward oversold (<30); look for divergences with price for potential reversals.
- Indicator: boll_ub | Role: Upper volatility boundary / breakout pressure | Interpretation: Price touching/holding near the upper band suggests strong momentum; confirm with other signals to avoid premature exits.
- Indicator: boll_lb | Role: Lower volatility boundary / downside risk | Interpretation: Price near/below the lower band indicates oversold pressure or potential bounce; use with trend context and other momentum signals.
