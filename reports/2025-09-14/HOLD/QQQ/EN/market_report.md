I attempted to fetch QQQ data (2024-09-14 to 2025-09-14) to generate the indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError). This looks like an issue on the data service side right now. I can retry immediately, or adjust the date window if you’d like. In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators and why they’re suitable for analyzing QQQ in a typical tech-led, growth-sensitive regime.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Provides a medium-term trend view and dynamic support/resistance. Helps gauge whether price is in an overall uptrend or downtrend and can act as a filter for timing with faster signals.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming regime (bullish vs bearish) and for identifying major crossovers like golden/death crosses that can mark shifts in macro direction.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts and potential near-term entry/exit points. Works well when used with the longer-term SMAs to filter noise.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Core momentum signal. MACD crossovers and divergences help identify trend-change inflection points and momentum shifts.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Signal line for MACD. Crossovers with the MACD line are commonly used as entry/exit confirmations within a broader strategy.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Histogram of MACD momentum. Visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than the MACD line itself; useful for detecting weakening or strengthening moves.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Why: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold insights. Useful for spotting potential reversals and divergence when price is extended, especially in range-bound or choppy conditions.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Why: Measures current volatility to inform risk management (position sizing, stop placement). Reactive but essential to adapt stops and expectations to changing market turbulence.

What I’ll do next (once data fetch succeeds)
- Retrieve the necessary data for QQQ for the requested window.
- Compute the eight indicators above.
- Provide a detailed, nuanced report describing:
  - Trend orientation across the three moving averages (short, mid, long term) and any crossovers.
  - MACD/MACDS/macdh dynamics and how momentum is evolving, including any divergences.
  - RSI levels and potential reversals or confirmations in the context of the prevailing trend.
  - ATR-driven volatility regime and implications for risk management.
  - Any notable interactions (e.g., RSI overbought while price remains above 50/200 SMA; MACD histogram confirming a new up-leg with rising ATR).
- Include a concise set of trading insights and possible edge cases to be aware of, plus risk considerations given current volatility.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry data fetch with the same date window (2024-09-14 to 2025-09-14)?
- Try a shorter or different window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to get a timely view?
- Proceed with the 8-indicator report as soon as data is available?

Markdown table: Key indicators and rationale
| Indicator | Category | Rationale for QQQ context |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps filter signals from faster indicators. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation; useful for assessing regime and major trend changes. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Quick momentum shifts; provides timely signals when used with longer-term averages. |
| macd | MACD Related | Core momentum signal; crossovers/divergence indicate potential trend changes. |
| macds | MACD Related | Signal line crossovers for additional confirmation of MACD signals. |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength visualization; early clue to accelerating or weakening moves. |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold context and potential reversal signals; useful with trend filters. |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility-based risk management; informs stop placement and position sizing. |

Note: I’ll adjust or expand the analysis if you want me to include Bollinger bands (boll, boll_ub, boll_lb) or VWMA, but I’ve prioritized a balanced set of 8 indicators that cover trend, momentum, and volatility without redundancy.
