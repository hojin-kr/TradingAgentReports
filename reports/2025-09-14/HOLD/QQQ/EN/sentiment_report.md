Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment/news for QQQ (the Nasdaq-100 ETF) for 2025-09-14, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I’ve retried, but the tool is currently failing on this endpoint. I can either retry again shortly, or proceed with a qualitative, data-light section now and fill in the Reddit-driven sentiment once the tool is back up. Here’s how I propose we proceed and what I can deliver in the meantime.

What I can deliver right now (structure and focus)
- Context: QQQ is an ETF tracking the Nasdaq-100, so sentiment here reflects broad tech/AI, semis, and large-cap growth dynamics rather than a single company event. The analysis will weight the ETF’s top holdings and macro/sector signals that typically move QQQ (AI cycle, earnings of tech giants, rate expectations, geopolitical risk, etc.).
- Data plan (once tool is available): daily sentiment pulse from Reddit and other social sources, news headlines, and an integrated sentiment score by day for the past week. Then translate that into implications for traders and potential moves for QQQ.
- Interim deliverables: a robust framework for the full report and a placeholder section summarizing what to expect from the Reddit data and news data when the tool is functioning again.

Proposed next steps (two options)
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (or as soon as the tool is available) and then produce the full, data-driven long report with a final Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: I proceed with a qualitative, data-light version now, clearly labeling data gaps, and then I update with the Reddit/news data once the tool is back.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll run the Reddit data fetch again and then deliver the full long-form report with insights, plus the Markdown table at the end.

Draft structure of the forthcoming long report (subject to data once retrieved)
