I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock news for NFLX, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It seems the Reddit data fetch is currently unavailable.

What would you like to do next?
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (to pull the latest social sentiment data) and then compile the full, detailed report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: I proceed with a structured, manual analysis based on publicly known context up to now (without live Reddit data), and mark it as a best-effort summary awaiting live data when the tool is back online.

If you want Option A, I’ll retry immediately. If you prefer Option B, I’ll deliver:
- Social sentiment framework (positive/negative/neutral signals) with caveats
- Key recent news and catalysts for NFLX
- Potential implications for traders (short-term vs. longer-term)
- A final Markdown table summarizing key points

Which would you like?
