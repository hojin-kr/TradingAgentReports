Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch NFLX data (2024-09-14 to 2025-09-14) but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry fetching the data now, but in the meantime I’ve prepared a structured plan with a carefully chosen set of indicators that will give you complementary insights once the data loads. When the data is available, I’ll compute and present a detailed, nuanced trend report using these indicators.

Selected indicators (up to 8) for NFLX
Rationale: These picks cover trend direction, momentum, volatility, and volume-confirmed signals without overlapping too much. They’re suitable for a volatile, high-variance stock like NFLX, where earnings/strategy shifts can cause rapid moves.

1) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps filter out noise from rapid intraday moves and provides context for longer-term trend.

2) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why: Long-term trend confirmation. Useful for identifying trend regime (bullish/bearish) and potential golden/death cross signals when paired with the 50 SMA.

3) close_10_ema
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why: Responsive short-term trend/momentum gauge. Captures quick shifts that may precede larger trend moves, especially around earnings or product/mandate news.

4) macd
- Category: MACD Related
- Why: Momentum change signals via crossovers and divergence. Provides a dynamic view of trend strength and potential reversals.

5) macds
- Category: MACD Related
- Why: MACD Signal line acts as a smoother trigger/filter for MACD cross signals, reducing noise and adding reliability to entries/exits.

6) rsi
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- Why: Momentum pullbacks/overbought-oversold context. Useful for spotting divergences and potential reversals, especially when market or stock is trending.

7) atr
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- Why: Measures true market volatility, useful for risk management, stop placement, and position sizing during regime shifts.

8) vwma
- Category: Volume-Based Indicators
- Why: Volume-weighted trend confirmation. Helps distinguish price moves that are supported by volume from thin-volume moves, aiding in filtering false signals.

Notes on usage and context for NFLX
- NFLX is a growth/tech-driven name that can exhibit sharp moves around earnings, content slate announcements, or subscriber metrics. The combination above provides:
  - Trend framing (50/200 SMA) with momentum confirmation (MACD family and RSI).
  - Fast momentum signals (10 EMA) to catch quicker shifts.
  - Volatility-aware risk management (ATR) to adjust stops and position sizing.
  - Volume-confirmed price action (VWMA) to avoid chasing moves driven by unsustainable spikes.

Next steps
- I will retry the data fetch (NFLX, 2024-09-14 to 2025-09-14) and, once the data is retrieved, compute the 8 indicators listed above.
- I will generate a detailed, nuanced trend report that includes:
  - Current trend direction and regime (short, medium, long term)
  - Momentum signals and potential crossovers/divergences
  - Volatility context and risk management implications
  - Volume confirmation for price moves
  - Practical trading implications (possible entry/exit ideas, with caveats)

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now and proceed with the full indicators analysis as soon as the data is available?

Markdown table: Key indicators and their roles
| Indicator | Category | Why it’s included for NFLX | How to interpret signals (in brief) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Indicates medium-term trend direction and acts as dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests bullish bias; cross of price over 50SMA or a flip from below to above can be a signal; cross below may indicate weakness |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Confirms long-term trend regime; helps identify major trend context | Price above 200SMA implies long-term uptrend; cross with 50SMA (golden cross) or price below 200SMA implies risk of long-term weakness |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Captures quick momentum shifts; responsive to news-driven moves | Price above 10EMA suggests short-term strength; cross below may precede a pullback; use with longer-term filters |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend-change signals; useful in varied regimes | MACD line crossing above/below the signal line indicates potential bullish/bearish moves; watch for divergences with price |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoother confirmation for MACD-derived signals | Crosses between MACD and MACDS validate entries/exits and reduce whipsaws |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context and divergence signals | RSI >70 may signal overbought; RSI <30 may signal oversold; divergences with price can precede reversals |
| atr | Volatility | Adapts risk parameters to market activity; helps position sizing and stop placement | Rising ATR implies higher volatility and larger stop ranges; falling ATR implies tighter risk controls |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Confirms price moves with volume; filters out low-volume spikes | Price movement with rising VWMA strengthens conviction; weak or diverging volume may warn of unreliable moves |

If you’d prefer a different indicator mix (e.g., swap ATR for Bollinger-related measures or add one more volatility/volume indicator), I can adjust before or after data retrieval.
