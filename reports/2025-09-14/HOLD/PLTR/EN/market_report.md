Appreciate the ticker. I attempted to fetch PLTR price data via get_YFin_data but the backend returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source tool is unavailable right now (or the path to the CSV is missing). I can:

- Retry fetching data automatically, or
- Proceed with an indicator-based analysis framework using the available indicators (without live data), or
- Use a placeholder approach and fill in PLTR-specific readings once the data fetch succeeds.

If you’d like me to keep going now, I recommend retrying the data pull in a moment. In the meantime, here’s a tightly-focused indicator set I’ll use (up to 8 indicators) with rationale tailored to PLTR’s typical characteristics (tech/scale-up name with potential volatility and episodic momentum shifts). Once the data is available, I’ll compute and interpret these together.

Selected indicators (8, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  Why: Helps picture the medium-term trend and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful for filtering trades in a stock that can swing between growth rallies and pullbacks.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Confirms major regime direction and can flag golden/death cross possibilities when combined with shorter-term signals.
- close_10_ema: 10-period exponential moving average
  Why: Responsive short-term momentum guide. Can help detect quick shifts and potential entry/exit points when aligned with longer trend filters.
- macd: MACD line
  Why: Core momentum signal. Crossovers with the MACD line, plus divergence with price, can signal trend changes in PLTR’s often-volatile moves.
- macds: MACD Signal
  Why: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line generate clearer trade signals and help reduce whipsaw in choppier periods.
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  Why: Visualizes momentum strength and rising/falling momentum. Divergence with price can preview upcoming reversals ahead of MACD crossovers.
- rsi: RSI
  Why: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold cues (commonly 70/30). Divergence can hint at reversals in momentum, especially when price trend is uneven.
- atr: Average True Range
  Why: Volatility gauge for risk management and position sizing. Helps set stop levels and adapt to changing volatility, which PLTR often exhibits around catalysts.

How I’ll interpret these once data is available
- Trend alignment: Look for price trading above or below 50SMA and 200SMA to confirm medium-to-long-term trend; crossovers (e.g., price above 50SMA while 50SMA holds above 200SMA) reinforce bullish bias.
- Momentum confirmations: MACD lines crossing above/below and MACD histogram turning positive/negative will signal momentum shifts. Cross-check with RSI to avoid entering on overheated momentum in a strong uptrend or a dead-cat bounce in a downtrend.
- Volatility context: ATR will tell us when to widen or tighten stops and adapt position size; higher ATR means bigger potential moves and risk, lower ATR means tighter management.
- Entry/exit framing: Use the short-term 10 EMA cross with the price and align with MACD momentum and RSI levels for entries, while using ATR-based thresholds for stop placement.

Next steps and options
- Option A (preferred): Retry get_YFin_data now or shortly. If successful, I’ll generate a detailed PLTR analysis using the 8 indicators above and deliver a nuanced, data-backed interpretation with a final table.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative framework immediately (no live data) and fill in real readings after the data fetch succeeds.
- Option C: If you have a preferred time horizon (intraday, swing, or long-term) or catalysts (earnings, product launches), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis accordingly.

Would you like me to retry the data pull now, or should I proceed with the indicator-based framework and provide the detailed interpretation as soon as the data becomes available?

Appendix: Quick reference table (planning, not PLTR readings yet)

| Indicator | Category | Purpose for PLTR | How to interpret (when data is available) |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA suggests bias; cross with price for entries/exits |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above/below 200SMA signals regime; cross with 50SMA for major trend shifts |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; cross with price/other MAs for timely entries |
| macd | MACD | Momentum trend changes | Crossover with signal for potential entry/exit; watch divergences |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoother MACD signals | Cross with MACD line strengthens trade signals or warns of false positives |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Rising/falling momentum; divergence vs. price provides early hints |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold cues | 70/30 thresholds; divergences signal potential reversals when in sync with trend |
| atr | Volatility | Risk management & position sizing | Higher ATR means wider stops; lower ATR implies tighter risk controls |

If you’d like me to proceed with a retry now, say “Retry data fetch,” and I’ll attempt again and then deliver a full, detailed PLTR report with the 8 indicators once data is retrieved.
