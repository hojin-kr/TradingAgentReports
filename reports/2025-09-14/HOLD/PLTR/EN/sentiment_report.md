Sorry about that—the Reddit stock info tool seems to be failing with a FileNotFoundError on the backend right now. Not a user error, but I can’t fetch the latest PLTR Reddit sentiment data at the moment.

What I can do now:
- Propose a plan and start preparing your long-form PLTR analysis as soon as the data tool is back, or if you prefer, I can proceed with a structured template using placeholders until we can pull the actual Reddit sentiment and recent news.
- If you want, I can also switch to (or add) other sources for sentiment/news you approve (e.g., headlines, official filings, market news) while we wait for the Reddit feed.

Proposed plan for the PLTR long report (to be completed once data is available):
1) Executive snapshot
   - Quick read on current sentiment, key catalysts, and risk factors.
2) Social media sentiment analysis (Reddit-focused)
   - Daily sentiment scores for the past 7–14 days, with the latest date highlighted.
   - Top themes, bull vs bear split, and notable posts driving sentiment.
   - Any correlation between sentiment spikes and price/action moves.
3) News and events roundup
   - Summary of last 7–14 days of company news, earnings commentary, product launches, partnerships, and regulatory developments.
   - Impact assessment: positive/negative/neutral catalysts and likely duration.
4) Quantitative sentiment trends
   - Day-by-day sentiment, volume, and a simple net sentiment index.
   - Identification of outliers or unusual activity days.
5) Market/price context
   - Price action around sentiment spikes, support/resistance zones, implied volatility notes if applicable.
   - Any notable options activity that aligns with sentiment signals.
6) Trader/investor implications
   - Short-, medium-, and long-term considerations.
   - Potential trade ideas and risk controls ( catalysts, earnings cadence, regulatory risk, competitive landscape).
7) Key takeaways (concise)
   - Actionable bullets for traders with confidence levels and caveats.
8) Makrmarkdown table
   - A compact table organizing the above points for quick reference.

Would you like me to:
- Retry fetching the Reddit data now (if the backend comes back up), or
- Proceed with the template and fill in details as soon as I can access the Reddit data, or
- Add alternative sources right away (e.g., recent news headlines and earnings coverage) to start building the report?

If you prefer, I can also start drafting the report structure now and indicate where Reddit sentiment and news data will be plugged in once accessible.
