Given the comprehensive investment plan you shared, the current stance should be HOLD for AAPL.

Rationale
- Near-term risk concerns dominate: hardware-cycle normalization, China/regulatory headwinds, and the potential for Services momentum to underwhelm if execution falters.
- Data gaps in sentiment and fundamentals reduce conviction for a larger exposure today, supporting a cautious stance.
- The bull case remains intact over the long run (Services expansion, ecosystem moat, cash generation), but the payoff requires clearer, durable signals before sizing up.

Actionable recommendations
- If you’re already long: trim to a modest, balanced exposure (e.g., 25-50% of your prior target) and consider reallocating some capital to diversification or cash.
- If you’re new to AAPL: establish a small starter position only as a hedge/beta proxy, not core conviction. Avoid heavy loading until clearer data emerges.
- Hedging/risk controls:
  - Consider a protective put (OTM, 1–2 quarters out) to cap downside, or implement a collar (long stock, long put, short call) to offset cost and cap upside.
  - Use stop or trailing stops around key levels (e.g., around the 50-day/200-day moving averages or a defined percentage drawdown) to control downside during volatility around events.
- Data-watch and triggers:
  - Upgrade to Buy only on a confluence of signals: price above both 50SMA and 200SMA with volume, positive MACD momentum, constructive RSI, and most importantly, clear acceleration in Services revenue/margin and durable AI monetization with improving regulatory clarity.
  - If these signals fail to materialize, stay in Hold or reduce exposure further.

Data and evaluation plan
- Prioritize refreshed fundamentals on Services growth, mix of hardware vs. services, profitability, and regulatory/regional risk signals.
- Reassess in 4–6 weeks or around key catalysts (earnings, product events) with updated data feeds.

Learning note
- In line with prudent risk management, avoid overreliance on a single catalyst. Use hedges and predefined triggers to shift stance only when data confirms a durable trend.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
