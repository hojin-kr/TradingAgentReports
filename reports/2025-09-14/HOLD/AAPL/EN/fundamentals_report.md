Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest week’s fundamental data for AAPL (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) using the available tools, but ran into a backend error (FileNotFoundError). Here’s what happened and how I suggest we proceed.

What happened
- All initial tool calls returned an internal error indicating a missing file or resource.
- This prevents producing the full, data-backed fundamental report you requested for the past week.

Proposed next steps
- Retry data retrieval now (I’ll re-run the tool calls individually to avoid the parallel wrapper issue). If the backend is temporarily unavailable, I’ll continue to retry and report progress.
- If the retry still fails, we can:
  - Narrow the date window (e.g., 2025-09-07 to 2025-09-14) or switch to the most recent completed quarter’s data, or
  - Fall back to a qualitative framework based on publicly known filings and earnings history (with clear caveats that data is not pulled from the live feed right now).
- Once data is retrieved, I’ll produce a comprehensive report that includes:
  - Company profile and basic financials
  - Latest quarterly/annual income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement
  - Insider sentiment (past 15 days) and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Historical financial history and trends (last several quarters/years)
  - Fine-grained insights and trader-oriented takeaways (risks, catalysts, and what to watch)
  - A final Markdown table of key points for quick reference

What I can provide right now (structure with placeholders)
- The report will include sections like:
  - Company overview and profile
  - Latest financial snapshot (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow)
  - Financial history and trend analysis
  - Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Risk factors, catalysts, and trading considerations
  - Quick-reference table of key points

If you’d like me to proceed immediately, I’ll retry the data retrieval now and then deliver the full report as soon as the data comes back. Alternatively, tell me to proceed with a qualitative framework or a different date window.

Appendix: Markdown table (placeholder until data is retrieved)
- This table will be filled with the actual figures and insights once data is available.

| Topic | Data Status | Key Points (will update after retrieval) |
|---|---|---|
| Insider sentiment (past 15 days) | Pending / error | |
| Insider transactions (past 15 days) | Pending / error | |
| Balance sheet (latest, quarterly) | Pending / error | |
| Cash flow (latest, quarterly) | Pending / error | |
| Income statement (latest, quarterly) | Pending / error | |
| Financial history (quarters/years) | Pending / error | |
| Company profile & business model | Available in general | Apple Inc. (AAPL) overview, segments, competitive position |
| Risks & catalysts | To be updated | Regulatory, supply chain, product cycle, macro factors |

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or would you prefer I start with a qualitative report based on publicly available context and best-practice fundamentals while we wait for the data pull?
