Sorry — I tried to fetch Reddit-based stock news for AAPL on 2025-09-14, but the get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like that data source is temporarily unavailable or misconfigured right now.

How would you like to proceed?
- Option 1: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (if you want me to persist with the same date, I can keep attempting).
- Option 2: I proceed with a best-effort, in-depth analysis using other accessible sources (public news, historical sentiment patterns, known catalysts) and clearly label any data gaps.
- Option 3: You provide alternative data sources or allow me to pull from other tools you may have access to.

If you’d like me to proceed immediately with a structured framework, here is a ready-to-fill approach I’ll deliver once data is available. I’ll include detailed analysis and a final Markdown table at the end.

What I’ll cover (framework):
- Executive snapshot
  - Overall sentiment trend for AAPL over the past 7 days
  - Key sentiment drivers (e.g., product/news cadence, services vs. hardware remarks)
  - Any major divergence between social sentiment and fundamentals
- Social media sentiment deep-dive
  - Daily sentiment scores and notable tweets/posts
  - Top recurring themes (e.g., iPhone/Apple Watch rumors, AI features, supply chain chatter, earnings timing)
  - Community sentiment vs. mainstream media sentiment alignment or misalignment
- News and catalysts (past week)
  - Earnings cadence, product announcements, regulatory/regulatory scrutiny, supply chain updates, partnerships
  - Any notable insider activity or analyst commentary shifts
- Sentiment-to-price implications
  - Short-term catalysts and risk factors (e.g., product launch window, NDA upcomings)
  - Potential overhangs or upside surprises observed in sentiment trends
- Trader takeaways and hedging ideas
  - Position sizing considerations given sentiment volatility
  - Event-driven strategies (if any identified) and risk controls
  - Key levels to watch (technical context that lines up with sentiment news)
- Limitations and data gaps
  - Where Reddit-specific sentiment is missing or inconclusive for the requested date
  - How I would adjust once the data source is back online

If you want me to proceed now with this framework, I’ll populate it as soon as the Reddit data tool is available again or you provide alternative sentiment sources. I’ll also append a Markdown table at the end to organize key points clearly.

Provisional Markdown table (structure; to be filled with data once available)
- Key Points
- Daily Sentiment (7d)
- Top Themes
- Notable News/Catalysts (Past Week)
- Market Implications
- Trader Takeaways
- Data Source(s)

Please tell me which option you prefer, and I’ll move forward accordingly.
