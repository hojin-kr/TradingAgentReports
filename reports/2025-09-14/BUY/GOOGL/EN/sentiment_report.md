I tried to fetch Reddit stock info for GOOGL on 2025-09-14, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a backend issue with the data fetcher right now.

Here are options to move forward:
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data pull now (and then produce the full weekly sentiment + news report once it succeeds).
- Option B: I proceed with a best-effort synthesis using other sources (public headlines, general sentiment signals, and known recent news) for the past week, and clearly label the data as not including Reddit-specific posts until the tool issue is resolved.
- Option C: You can specify another date window or ticker (in case you want cross-checks with different data).

If you want the fastest path, I can start with Option A (retry Reddit data) and, in parallel, prepare a structured report outline so I can fill in the content as soon as the Reddit feed comes through.

What would you prefer? If youâ€™d like, I can also proceed with Option B right away and clearly mark the limitations.
