I attempted to pull the latest insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin financial statements for GOOGL, but all tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError indicating the data retrieval layer is currently unavailable or misconfigured.

What I can do next (please choose one):
- Retry automatically: I can attempt the tool calls again in a moment and return with the actual data as soon as they succeed.
- Use a fallback approach: I can provide a comprehensive fundamentals report structure now (with detailed analysis and a Markdown table at the end) using placeholders, so you have a ready template. Once the data tools are working, I can fill in the exact figures.
- Proceed with a qualitative analysis: I can deliver a rigorous, trader-focused fundamental report based on publicly known information (business model, competitive landscape, recent earnings context, etc.) but without the latest 15-day insider data or the most recent quarterly figures.

If you’d like me to proceed now with a ready-to-fill template, here is a comprehensive report structure you can expect, followed by a Markdown table skeleton. I will fill it in with real data as soon as the data tools are available again.

Next steps: Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like me to retry the data pulls now, I’ll attempt the calls again and then deliver a full, data-filled report with the Markdown table at the end. If you’d prefer the fallback/template path, I’ll present the filled-out framework and wait for data to be plugged in once the tool issue is resolved.
