I tried to fetch the GOOGL data for the requested window, but the data retrieval service returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a backend data source issue rather than a problem with the ticker. I’m ready to retry as soon as the service is available, but in the meantime I can set up the analysis framework and the indicator mix we’ll use as soon as data comes through.

Proposed 8-indicator setup for GOOGL (diverse, complementary signals)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages): Identifies the medium-term trend and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful for filtering entries in a drift-driven market.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages): Establishes the long-term trend and helps confirm major trend direction (golden/death cross context). Provides strategic trend confirmation.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages): Captures quick momentum shifts and potential entry points. More responsive than the SMAs, useful for timing in trending markets but can add noise in choppy markets; best when used with longer averages for filtering.
- macd (MACD): Measures momentum via differences of EMAs; crossovers help identify trend changes. Helpful to spot growing or fading momentum when price action is limited.
- macds (MACD Signal): The signal line; crossovers with MACD can trigger signals and add robustness to MACD-based decisions.
- rsi (Momentum Indicators): Assesses momentum and potential reversals with overbought/oversold thresholds; watch for divergences in line with trend context.
- atr (Volatility Indicators): Measures average true range; informs stop placement and position sizing to align with current volatility.
- boll (Bollinger Middle): The 20-period middle line; provides a dynamic baseline to gauge price deviations, breakouts, or pullbacks when used with bands for confirmation.

Notes:
- This set aims to balance trend confirmation (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum (MACD family, RSI), and risk management (ATR) with a volatility-aware baseline (Boll middle).
- If data becomes available, I will generate a full, nuanced report with:
  - Current trend direction (short-, medium-, long-term)
  - Momentum and potential breakout/reversal signals
  - Key support/resistance levels derived from moving averages and Bollinger context
  - Volume considerations (VWMA could be added if we extend beyond the 8-indicator limit)
  - Risk management notes (ATR-based stop placement, position sizing guidance)
  - Clear, timestamped signals and a concise trader-oriented summary

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or should I wait and attempt again automatically in a few minutes? If you have another data source or a CSV you can upload, I can proceed immediately with the analysis using the same indicator framework. 

Markdown table: Selected indicators and rationale
| Indicator | Category | Rationale for GOOGL | Key signals to watch |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Trend direction changes around 50-SMA; price bouncing near/away from the 50-SMA |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation; context for entries | Golden cross/death cross signals; persistent price above/below 200-SMA |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts; earlier entries | Crosses with longer-term averages; rapid price moves around the 10-EMA |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum shifts; trend change signals | MACD line cross over the signal line; positive/negative momentum divergence |
| macds | MACD Signal | Confirmation of MACD signals; reduces false positives | MACD vs MACD Signal cross confirmations |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold context; divergence potential | RSI approaching/extending 70/30; bullish/bearish divergences |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility-based risk management; sizing and stops | Rising ATR suggests wider stops; falling ATR suggests tighter stops |
| boll | Volatility Indicators | Baseline for deviation from price; baseline for breakouts | Price moving relative to BollinMiddle; proximity to extremes can indicate breakout or reversal context |
