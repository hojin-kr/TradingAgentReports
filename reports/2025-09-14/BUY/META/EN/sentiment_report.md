Thanks for your patience. I attempted to pull Reddit-based sentiment for META across 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-14, but the Reddit stock info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError for all dates. I can retry in a bit, or proceed with an alternative approach using other sources if you’d like. In the meantime, here’s a practical path forward and a provisional, high-level META analysis you can use for traders, with a Markdown table at the end as requested.

What happened
- Tool status: get_reddit_stock_info is returning FileNotFoundError. I’m unable to fetch daily Reddit sentiment data at the moment.
- Next options: 
  - Retry the Reddit data pull now or later (I can attempt again if you want).
  - Proceed with a qualitative, source-agnostic analysis focusing on likely sentiment drivers and recent news catalysts META would be reacting to around Sep 2025.

 interim high-level META sentiment considerations (without Reddit data)
- Key drivers likely shaping sentiment
  - AI strategy and monetization: META’s ongoing AI initiatives across Facebook/Instagram, and potentially new ad-tech or creator tools, often drive expectations for improved ad efficiency and revenue growth.
  - Ad market dynamics: Global ad spend trends, brand advertiser confidence, and iOS/privacy-related changes affecting targeting/measures can sway sentiment positively or negatively.
  - Metaverse and hardware bets: Progress (or setbacks) in Quest hardware, virtual/augmented reality experiences, and enterprise/corporate adoption can influence investor mood, especially if cost containment or user engagement is improving.
  - Regulatory and privacy environment: Any new antitrust or data-privacy developments, especially around targeted advertising, tend to produce volatility in sentiment.
  - Earnings cadence and guidance: Expectations for monetization efficiency, operating margins, AI-enabled cost reductions, and user metrics (MAU/DAU) are primary sentiment drivers around quarterly results.
- Thematic sentiment you’ll likely see in posts
  - Optimism if AI innovations translate into clear monetization or cost efficiency gains, and if user engagement metrics remain healthy.
  - Caution if regulatory pressures tighten ad targeting or if AI investments weigh on near-term margins.
  - Mixed feelings on Metaverse: enthusiasm for long-term potential offset by near-term execution risk and heavy capex.
- Near-term trading implications
  - A positive surprise on earnings or AI-driven monetization signals could spark a relief rally or gap higher.
  - A miss or softer guidance, especially around ad revenue growth or margins, could trigger a drawdown or volatility as investors reassess risk.
  - Regulatory/watch-list catalysts can cause quick reversals, particularly if paired with a broader tech sector rotation.

Proposed next steps (to finalize the report once Reddit data is available)
- Retrieve daily Reddit sentiment for META for 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-14 (as planned) and extract:
  - Overall daily sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Top themes and keywords per day
  - Notable posts or threads with high engagement
  - Source credibility signals (amateur vs. expert discussions)
- Cross-check with contemporaneous news headlines to identify catalysts (earnings, product launches, regulatory news, major partnerships, stock actions).
- Synthesize into:
  - A day-by-day sentiment delta and its correlation with any notable news
  - A risk-adjusted sentiment score with commentary on upside/downside risk
  - Practical trading implications (short-term reentry levels, potential catalysts to watch, and risk controls)
- Deliver a final, detailed long-form report with a concluding set of actionable takeaways and a Markdown table summarizing key points.

Markdown table (key synthesis, to append at the end)
- Note: This table reflects the structure of the final report and current status (pending data). Once Reddit data is retrieved, the sentiment rows can be populated with precise daily values.

| Aspect | What we know now | Trading implications (tentative) | Data status | Next data needs |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Reddit sentiment (daily) | Not available yet due to tool error | Await data to gauge day-by-day mood; look for positive spikes vs. negative downdrafts and their relation to news | Pending | Reddit sentiment for 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-14 |
| Daily themes (pending) | Common themes around META typically include AI monetization, ad demand, privacy/regulation, Metaverse progress | Positive themes may support short-term upside; negative themes may trigger volatility | Pending | Top daily themes and keywords per date |
| News catalysts (contextual) | Earnings cycles, AI/product news, regulatory updates likely drivers in this window | Earnings surprises or regulatory developments can override sentiment | Not pulled in this session | contemporaneous META news headlines for 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-14 |
| Key risk factors (contextual) | Ad market softness, privacy regulation, AI investment costs, competition with peers | Risks can cap upside or trigger risk-off moves unless offset by catalysts | General context | Specific risk flags tied to dates in window |
| Potential trading stance (based on typical patterns) | Neutral-to-cautious awaiting confirmatory sentiment; sharp moves on news catalysts | Prepare for volatility around earnings or regulatory news; identify clear reaction thresholds | Not confirmed | Confirmed sentiment and news linkage to set position guidance |
| Data reliability note | Current Reddit data stream unavailable; conclusions pending | Treat interim impressions as provisional; rely on confirmed data before making trades | In-progress | Full data pull when tool is available |

Would you like me to:
- Retry pulling the Reddit sentiment data now, or
- Wait and proceed with the qualitative analysis plus the eventual, data-driven sentiment synthesis once the tool is functional, or
- Use alternative sentiment sources (if you have them) to triangulate now?

If you prefer, I can keep monitoring and reattempt the Reddit data pull and deliver the full, detailed report with the finalized daily sentiment table as soon as the tool responds.
