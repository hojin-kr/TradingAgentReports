I attempted to pull META fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financials) but I'm hitting an internal tool error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory) on all requested data sources. I don’t have validated numbers to report yet. I can either retry now or wait and try again later. In the meantime, here’s a thorough framework and a plan for the final report, plus a placeholder structure you can use once the data loads.

What I will deliver once data is available
- Comprehensive fundamental report for META (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement) with detailed, trader-oriented insights.
- Fine-grained analysis: margins, cash flow quality, capex intensity, debt levels, liquidity, earnings quality, revenue mix (advertising vs. other), user metrics, and cost controls.
- Insider signals: interpret sentiment trends and transaction patterns (e.g., sustained insider buying vs. selling, size, and frequency) and assess potential implications for stock moves.
- A concise, decision-ready summary with actionable takeaways and risk factors.
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference.

Proposed structure of the final report (to be filled with data when available)
- Executive summary: High-level read on fundamental health and potential catalysts/risks.
- Company profile: META Platforms, Inc. business model, segments, key products, geographic exposure.
- Recent financial snapshot (latest quarterly data): revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, R&D and Opex, margins, EPS.
- Balance sheet highlights: assets, liabilities, cash, debt (short-term vs long-term), working capital, liquidity ratios.
- Cash flow highlights: operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash flow from investing and financing activities.
- Income statement deep dive: revenue composition, gross/net margins, expense trends, tax rate, unusual items.
- Cash flow quality and capital allocation: FCF yield, Capex as a percent of revenue, share buybacks vs. debt paydown.
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days): net sentiment, notable themes, any recurring signals.
- Insider transactions (past 15 days): notable buys/sells, volume patterns, potential implications.
- Financial history and trend analysis: QoQ and YoY trajectory, profitability, margin resilience, and cyclicality.
- Segment/regional dynamics: exposure by product, geography, and any regulatory or competitive pressures.
- Valuation context: how fundamentals align with current pricing drivers, sensitivity to ad market conditions, and peers.
- Risk factors and catalysts: regulatory, platform shifts, competition, monetization changes.
- Trader-oriented insights: key signals to watch, what would constitute a buy/sell/hold trigger given the fundamentals.
- Key takeaways and actionable recommendations.
- Appendix: data sources, methodology, and any caveats.

Provisional Markdown table (structure only; fill with data once retrieved)
- Note: This table is a placeholder showing the exact format I will deliver. Once data loads, I will populate with the actual figures and interpretations.

What I can do now
- I can retry all data pulls as soon as the tools are available again, or
- I can proceed with a qualitative META fundamentals overview based on public context up to 2024-2025 (without the exact numbers) and clearly mark data gaps for you to fill when data loads.

Please let me know how you’d like to proceed:
1) Retry data retrieval now (I’ll run the same tools again and report back with complete numbers as soon as they come in).
2) Proceed with a qualitative META fundamentals analysis (no exact figures, but with structured insights and potential signals to watch).
3) Wait and try again later; I can set a reminder to reattempt after a short interval.

If you prefer, I can start the qualitative analysis right away and tag sections that require data for you to review once the data loads.
