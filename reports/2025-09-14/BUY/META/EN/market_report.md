I attempted to fetch META data and the related indicator reports, but I hit a data retrieval error:

- The data service returned a FileNotFoundError when trying to fetch the data and indicators. This means I don’t currently have the actual per-date values to run the 8 indicators and generate the trend/momentum/volatility analysis for META as of 2025-09-14.

What I can do now
- I can prepare a thorough, nuanced analytical framework and decision guidance using the 8 most informative indicators once the data can be retrieved again.
- I can also proceed with a qualitative, data-agnostic assessment of META's typical behavior in this market context (heavyweights like META often show meaningful trend impulses tied to ad market conditions, AI expectations, and regulatory/news flows), but that would be less precise than data-driven insights.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators) and why they fit META today
1) close_50_sma
- Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why for META: Captures the ongoing trend amid tech/advertising cycles; helps validate if price is in a constructive framework.

2) close_200_sma
- Purpose: Long-term trend anchor; helps identify golden/death-cross contexts.
- Why for META: Useful to confirm secular direction given META’s larger-cap growth/advertising cyclicality and potential regime shifts.

3) close_10_ema
- Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum signal.
- Why for META: Provides early read on momentum shifts, useful for timing entries/exits around major events (earnings, product launches, AI updates).

4) macd
- Purpose: Momentum via MACD line (fast/slow EMA difference) to spot trend changes.
- Why for META: Helps confirm shifts in momentum with trend context added by the EMAs; good for crossovers in a tech-growth stock.

5) macds
- Purpose: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD) crossovers.
- Why for META: Signals more robust momentum-change confirmations when used with MACD proper.

6) macdh
- Purpose: MACD histogram; momentum strength visualization.
- Why for META: Divergence and momentum strength cues can flag potential reversals or acceleration ahead of price moves.

7) rsi
- Purpose: Momentum oscillator highlighting overbought/oversold and divergences.
- Why for META: Complements MACD by signaling relative strength/weakness; useful in choppy markets or during extended rallies when MACD may lag.

8) atr
- Purpose: Volatility measure to gauge price range and set risk parameters.
- Why for META: Important for position sizing, stop placement, and understanding current volatility regime, which matters for a stock with potentially large daily moves around earnings/news.

Notes on interpretation and pitfalls (when data is available)
- Trend vs. momentum: Use 50/200 SMA alignment to confirm trend direction, and use MACD-related signals plus RSI to time entries, while ATR helps with risk controls in that regime.
- Divergences: Watch RSI for bullish/bearish divergences against price and MACD for momentum divergences; confirm with price action around support/resistance.
- Volatility regime: ATR will tell you when to widen or tighten stops; in high-volatility periods around major events, rely more on volatility-informed risk management rather than aggressive entries.
- Redundancy caution: I’ve chosen MACD components and RSI to cover momentum without duplicating the same signal type; avoid adding stochastic RSI here to prevent overlapping signals.

Next steps
- I will re-run the data retrieval and indicator calculations as soon as the data service is available again.
- Once the data is in, I will deliver:
  - A detailed narrative of trend, momentum, and volatility insights for META as of 2025-09-14.
  - A concise set of entry/exit and risk management ideas tailored to the current regime.
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key observations and signals.

Please choose your preferred next action:
- Option A: Retry data retrieval now and then deliver the full 8-indicator report with interpretations.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative/Macro-driven analysis of META without data-backed indicator values (lower precision, but actionable context).
- Option C: Provide any specific date range, event window (e.g., earnings dates, AI product announcements) to tailor the analysis once data is available.
