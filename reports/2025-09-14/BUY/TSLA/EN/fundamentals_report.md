I attempted to fetch TSLA fundamentals for the past week, but Iâ€™m hitting a system error:

- All data calls returned FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory.
- This appears to be an internal data access issue rather than an issue with TSLA data itself.

What I can do next (choose one or combine):
- Retry the data fetch now to see if the backend recovers.
- Proceed with a thorough qualitative outline using known public information (company profile, business model, general financial trends, and how insider sentiment/transactions could influence traders) while we wait for the data tools to come back online.
- Use alternative data sources you prefer (if you have other endpoints or files you want me to try).

What I can deliver once data access is restored:
- A comprehensive fundamental report for TSLA covering:
  - Company profile and business segments
  - Basic financials (revenue, profitability, margins) from the most recent quarterly results
  - Balance sheet snapshot (assets, liabilities, equity) and liquidity/leverage indicators
  - Cash flow analysis (operating, investing, financing activities)
  - Historical financial trends (last few quarters/years)
  - Insider sentiment (public statements and views) and insider transactions (purchases/sales) for the past 15 days
  - Any notable week-over-week events affecting fundamentals (new product launches, capacity changes, capital raises/deployments)
  - Trader-focused insights: what the key numbers imply for momentum, risk, and positioning
  - A concise, structured Markdown table at the end that summarizes the core points and potential implications

Proposed Markdown table structure (fill with real data when available):
- Columns: Topic / Source / Period / Key Metrics / Observations / Trader Implications
- Rows examples: 
  - Company Profile / General knowledge / N/A / Tesla, Inc. segments (Automotive, Energy & Storage, Services) / Understand exposure to EV demand, energy storage cycles
  - Revenue/Income Statement / SimFin Income Statement (quarterly) / Revenue, Gross Margin, Operating Margin / Margin trajectories and scale effects / Implications for profitability trajectory
  - Balance Sheet / SimFin Balance Sheet (quarterly) / Cash & equivalents, Total Debt, Equity / Liquidity vs. leverage tension / Financing risk and liquidity headroom
  - Cash Flow / SimFin Cash Flow (quarterly) / Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow / Cash generation quality / Capacity to fund capex/units without equity raises
  - Insider Activity / Finnhub Insider Transactions / 15-day window / Net buys/sells, notable holders / Views on management confidence and potential mispricing
  - Insider Sentiment / Finnhub Insider Sentiment / 15-day window / Tone of insider communications / Possible signal about internal outlook

Would you like me to:
- Retry the data fetch now, or
- Provide the qualitative outline now (without the latest numbers) and then populate the data table as soon as the tools are available?

If you prefer, you can also specify a preferred fallback data source or tell me to proceed with the qualitative, event-driven analysis while we wait for the tool issue to be resolved.
