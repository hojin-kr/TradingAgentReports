Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch TSLA Reddit stock news for 2025-09-14, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like a temporary backend issue with the data retrieval tool rather than a market signal issue.

How would you like to proceed? I can choose one of the following options:
- Retry now for TSLA on 2025-09-14 and see if the issue resolves.
- Fetch Reddit data for an adjacent date to capture near-term sentiment (e.g., 2025-09-13 or 2025-09-15).
- Switch to a broader data collection approach (if you’re okay with using only Reddit data for now, I can retry; otherwise I can wait for the Reddit tool to be available and then proceed with the full report).

What would you prefer? If you’d like, I can also provide the plan for the full long-form report (sentiment by day, key post themes, notable news, implications for traders, and a final Markdown table) so you know what to expect once the data source is functioning again.
