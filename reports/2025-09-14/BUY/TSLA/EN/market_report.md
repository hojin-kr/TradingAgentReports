Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch TSLA price data to run the indicators, but I’m currently seeing a data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError from the data backend). I can retry in a moment or proceed with the plan and prepare the detailed analysis as soon as the data is available. Here’s how I’ll proceed and why these indicators are well-suited for TSLA given a typical active-micro/mid-term trading horizon.

Plan and rationale (up to 8 complementary indicators)
- close_50_sma: Identifies the mid-term trend and provides a dynamic support/resistance level. Helps gauge whether TSLA is in an uptrend or downtrend relative to a meaningful horizon (roughly 2-3 months of data).
- close_200_sma: Establishes the long-term trend context and helps confirm major regime shifts (golden cross, death cross) and overall directional bias. Useful for filtering trades that align with the longer-term trend.
- close_10_ema: Captures quick shifts in momentum and can highlight potential entry/exit points in faster market moves. Use with the longer-term SMAs to avoid false signals.
- macd: Measures momentum changes via MACD line crossovers and divergences. Useful for identifying potential shift points in trend direction, especially when price action is consolidating or moving with some volatility.
- macds: The MACD signal line; its crossovers with MACD provide a clearer trigger in combination with MACD for entries/exits.
- macdh: MACD Histogram; visualizes momentum strength and can show early divergences or acceleration/deceleration in momentum.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences. Helps spot reversals against the trend, especially when price action is extended.
- atr: Volatility gauge for risk management and position sizing. Helps set stop distances and adjust risk based on current market volatility.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A nuanced, fine-grained analysis that combines trend, momentum, and volatility signals to form a cohesive view for TSLA on or around 2025-09-14.
- Signals and interpretations for each indicator, with guidance on entry/exit considerations, alignment requirements (e.g., MACD cross with RSI not in overbought zone), and risk controls based on ATR.

Proposed concise interpretation approach (once data is ready)
- Check trend: Is price above both 50SMA and 200SMA? If yes, look for bullish MACD momentum; if below, bias toward bearish signals and use MACD/RSI to confirm entries with caution.
- Momentum confirmation: Use MACD and MACD Signal together; corroborate with RSI readings (e.g., RSI climbing toward 60-70 in uptrends, or failing to break 30-40 in downtrends as a potential sign of exhaustion).
- Risk management: Use ATR to set stop-loss distance (e.g., 1.5x ATR) and to size positions according to current volatility.
- Entry/exit cues: Look for alignment across 10-EMA with 50SMA alongside MACD momentum; RSI should not be in extreme overbought/oversold zones if taking offsetting positions.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry fetching TSLA data now and then run these indicators, or
2) Proceed with an indicators-only plan description (as above) and generate the full, data-backed report as soon as the data fetch succeeds?

If you’re okay with retrying, I’ll reattempt to pull the TSLA data for 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-14 and then generate the detailed report with the 8 indicators listed. I’ll also append a Markdown table summarizing the key points at the end of the final report. Here’s the table you’ll get:

Key indicators and roles for TSLA (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma: Mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend confirmation and regime shifts
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum shifts and potential entries
- macd: Momentum change signals and trend-change cues
- macds: MACD signal crossovers for trigger points
- macdh: Momentum strength and divergences
- rsi: Overbought/oversold context and potential reversals
- atr: Volatility-based risk management and position sizing

Please tell me if you’d like me to retry the data fetch now or proceed with the plan and report as soon as data comes in.
