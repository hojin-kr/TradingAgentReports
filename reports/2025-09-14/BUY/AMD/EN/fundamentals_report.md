Sorry—the data retrieval step failed due to an internal file-not-found error when I tried to fetch AMD’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, and financial statements. I can retry the data pulls now, or switch to a manual/alternative approach if you prefer. Here are options:

- Retry now: I’ll re-run all data calls (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement) in parallel.
- Sequential retry: I’ll retry each source one by one to isolate which one is failing.
- Alternative approach: I can provide a detailed qualitative fundamentals analysis based on publicly available context up to 2024 and outline what to watch in 2025, with a clearly labeled data-pending section until I can fetch the exact numbers.
- If you want, I can proceed with the report structure and placeholders so you can see the full format and fill in data as soon as it comes in.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to proceed with the retry now, I’ll execute it immediately and then return with the full, data-backed AMD fundamentals report, including insider sentiment and transactions, plus the latest balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement.

In the meantime, here is a ready-to-fill report framework and a Markdown table for key points. This keeps the structure in place so you can Review-and-fill as soon as data arrives.
