Thanks for your patience. I attempted to pull AMD data and run the indicator analyses, but the data retrieval tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError on all attempts. I can’t produce live indicator values for AMD right now. If you’d like, I can retry immediately, or proceed with a thorough, scenario-based framework you can use once the data fetch works. Below I’ve chosen a set of 8 complementary indicators (no redundancy) and provided a detailed, nuanced interpretation framework tailored to AMD in a typical mid-2024 to 2025 context. I’ll also include a practical table of key points at the end.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale for the selection
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Provide a clear view of medium- and long-term trend direction and potential support/resistance zones. They help distinguish structural trend from short-term noise, which is essential for a volatile name like AMD that can swing with project announcements and demand shifts.
- close_10_ema: Captures faster momentum shifts to spot potential entries or early trend changes; useful for timing in conjunction with the slower SMAs.
- macd and macds: Core momentum pair to identify trend changes via MACD line crosses and signalline crossovers; helps confirm or question trend durability.
- rsi: Momentum gauge for overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences, useful for spotting potential reversals within prevailing trends.
- boll: The Bollinger middle (20-SMA) provides a dynamic reference, while Bollinger bands help identify breakouts, squeezes, and mean-reversion pressure in AMD’s often volatile price action.
- atr: Volatility/adaptive risk metric to inform stop placement and position sizing, particularly important for AMD given episodic volatility around earnings and product cycles.

Nuanced AMD-focused interpretation framework (without live numbers)
- Trend assessment (50_sma vs 200_sma)
  - If price trades above both 50SMA and 200SMA with a bullish cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA), the medium-to-long-term trend is constructive. Look for pullbacks to the 50SMA or a test of the 200SMA as potential supports for entries, provided momentum confirms.
  - If price sits below the 200SMA with 50SMA also below and no bullish cross, treat as bearish or range-bound. Any rally back above the 50SMA but not the 200SMA may indicate a counter-trend bounce rather than a fresh uptrend.
- Short-term momentum (10_ema, MACD family, RSI)
  - 10_ema crossing above nearby levels (or price crossing above 10_ema) suggests a short-term bullish tilt, especially if MACD shows a positive crossover and rising histogram.
  - MACD trend
    - MACD line above its signal and both rising supports a bullish momentum push; watch for a MACD histogram expansion as confirmation.
    - A MACD bearish cross or a shrinking histogram signals waning momentum and potential consolidation or pullback.
  - RSI context
    - RSI climbing with price, but not yet overbought (e.g., below 70), supports continuation in the current trend.
    - RSI turning down from overbought levels or showing bearish divergence with price can hint at a near-term pullback even if trend remains intact.
- Volatility and breakout context (boll and atr)
  - Bollinger middle around price suggests a neutral center; look for width changes: tightening bands imply a potential breakout or breakdown as volatility compresses, while expanding bands support a continuation or the start of a move with higher volatility.
  - ATR informs risk management: rising ATR means higher expected price swings; widen stops and adjust position sizes accordingly; falling ATR suggests comitting with smaller stops may be reasonable in low-vol environments.
- Practical signal interpretation for trading AMD
  - Bullish setup (confluence)
    - Price above 50SMA and 200SMA, 50SMA crossing above 200SMA or a sustained price rally above both.
    - MACD above the signal with a rising histogram, RSI trending up but not in overbought territory, and a contracting Bollinger band squeeze resolving to a breakout.
    - Use ATR to set a volatility-informed stop and a position size that tolerates the expected move range.
  - Bearish setup (confluence)
    - Price below 200SMA with 50SMA below or crossing down, MACD below the signal with a negative histogram, RSI rolling over toward the 30s with potential bearish divergence.
    - Bollinger bands widening or price testing the lower band implies improved odds of further downside, with ATR rising signaling higher risk. Implement wider stops and possibly reduce size or consider hedging.
- Risk management notes for AMD
  - Earnings events and AI/server demand news can trigger outsized moves; ATR-based stops help adapt to changing volatility.
  - If you’re trading intraday or swing, rely on the 10_ema for entry timing, but use 50SMA/200SMA for trend confirmation and MACD/RSI for momentum filtering.
  - Volume confirmation (not part of the selected indicators here but worth watching) can augment these signals: rising volume on a breakout adds conviction; falling volume on a move may warn of false signals.

Next steps
- I can re-run the data retrieval and generate the exact indicator values for AMD as soon as the data tool is available again. If you’d like me to retry now, tell me to proceed and I’ll attempt another fetch and then summarize the actual readings and any actionable signals.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a purely qualitative, scenario-based plan (like above) and tailor it further once data returns, or I can simulate hypothetical readings to illustrate how signals would play out for AMD in different market contexts.

Markdown table: quick reference to the chosen indicators and their roles
| Indicator | Role | AMD-context interpretation notes | Signal interpretation cues |
|----------|------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Helps identify the intermediate trend path for AMD amid cyclical AI/server demand news | Price above/below 50SMA; 50SMA relative to price and 200SMA; use as anchor for entries |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms structural trend; golden/death cross signals possible strategic bias | Price above 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA suggests bullish regime; below implies bearish or consolidation |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum / entry timing | Captures quick shifts that may precede larger trend moves in AMD | Price/EA cross above 10_ema or a bullish short-term momentum signal |
| macd | Momentum momentum indicator | Validates momentum direction and strength in AMD’s moves | MACD line above signal with rising histogram is bullish; reversals flagged by cross or histogram turning south |
| macds | MACD signal line | Helps refine MACD cross signals and reduce false positives | MACD line crossing above/below MACDS at/near zero adds confirmation or caution |
| rsi | Momentum and potential reversal gauge | Contextualizes momentum strength; watch for divergence with price | RSI rising without hitting overbought may support continuation; falling RSI near 30-40 could warn of a pullback or reversal |
| boll | Volatility-based mean reversion and breakout context | Dynamic reference for price relative to trend; useful in AMD’s volatile moves | Price near/through Boll UB/LB with expanding bands can signal breakout; middle line as support/resistance |
| atr | Volatility/risk management metric | Guides stop placement and sizing given AMD’s volatility | Rising ATR suggests wider stops and/or larger position sizing; falling ATR allows tighter risk controls |

If you want, I can try the data pull again now and then provide a live, concrete summary of AMD’s actual indicator values and any actionable signals. Just say the word and I’ll retry immediately.
