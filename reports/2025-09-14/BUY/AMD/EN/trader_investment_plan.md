Decision: Buy, but with a disciplined, staged entry and robust risk controls.

Rationale (concise)
- Structural AI data-center thesis: AMD’s ecosystem (EPYC CPUs + MI accelerators + RDNA/GPU software) targets a multi-year AI infra cycle, with credible cloud deployments and cross-industry partnerships (e.g., Absci, Oracle, OCI/Vultr signals) adding tangible revenue upside beyond hype.
- Diversified stack reduces single-point risk: A broader product portfolio creates cross-sell opportunities and stickier customer relationships, which can support margin expansion as AI mix grows.
- Near-term margin risk acknowledged: The bear risk around margins is real, but the bull case rests on a path to higher AI-driven mix and software/recurring revenue that can lift gross margins over time.
- Catalysts and milestones are observable, not hypothetical pilots: Real deployments, pipeline progression, and announced product roadmaps (MI450/MI355X, RDNA4) provide measurable progress to monitor.

Implementation plan (summary)
1) Base exposure in tiers
- Start or add in tranches to reduce timing risk. Target 2–4% of the equity sleeve exposure, adjustable by risk tolerance; stagger adds as AI adoption milestones materialize.
2) Entry mechanics and risk controls
- Use limit orders near confluence support (trend levels, key moving averages).
- Initial stop: 8–12% below entry for the first tranche to cap downside on macro or company-specific shocks.
- Consider a collar or partial protective puts on a portion to limit downside during earnings/regulatory headlines.
3) Catalysts to monitor
- MI450/MI355X adoption milestones and any concrete cloud/container wins.
- Progress on Absci-Oracle-AMD and other ecosystem contracts (backlog, revenue visibility, gross margin impact).
- Hyperscaler procurement signals and any shifts in AI capex pace affecting AMD’s share.
4) Governance and review
- Quarterly check-ins on AI revenue mix, contract wins, and gross margin trajectory.
- If AI adoption signals strengthen with margin improvement, scale into the upper exposure target; if not, tighten stops or trim.

Risk notes
- Maintain awareness of competition (Nvidia’s ecosystem) and regulatory/export constraints, which can introduce volatility.
- If two straight quarters show AI adoption lag or margin stagnation, reassess core thesis and consider trimming or hedging more aggressively.

Lessons applied
- Tie exposure to observable milestones, not only announcements.
- Prioritize margin trajectory alongside top-line AI demand to avoid overpaying for growth.
- Use layered entry and hedges to protect against macro swings while the AI cycle matures.

Final check-in plan
- Be prepared to tighten risk controls quickly if momentum wanes or if earnings show margin deterioration.
- If concrete AI revenue mix and margin improvements emerge, progressively increase exposure; otherwise, stay prudent.
