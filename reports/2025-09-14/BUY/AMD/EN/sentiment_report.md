I attempted to fetch AMD Reddit data for 2025-09-14, but I hit a runtime error in the data tool (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). This looks like a backend issue with the Reddit data extractor.

What I can do right now
- I can still deliver a comprehensive AMD social sentiment and news analysis plan, and structure the final long report. I’ll just note where data from Reddit would fill in the gaps once the tool is working again.
- I can start assembling the framework, methodology, and an actionable set of insights based on available public signals (news coverage, general market sentiment, and known industry context) and outline exactly what to pull from Reddit as soon as the tool is available.

Recommended approach going forward
- Step 1: Re-run the Reddit data fetch for the past 7 days (or your preferred window) to capture day-by-day sentiment, popular themes, and notable posts.
- Step 2: Cross-check with recent AMD news (press releases, earnings, product announcements, partnerships, regulatory developments) to contextualize sentiment spikes.
- Step 3: Synthesize into trader-centric insights: sentiment momentum, key risk factors, price-impact signals, and potential catalysts.
- Step 4: Deliver a final long report with a clear Markdown table at the end.

Proposed report structure (to fill in once Reddit data is available)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment direction, notable sentiment drivers, and near-term catalysts.
- Day-by-day sentiment profile (past 7–14 days): scores, top themes, and example posts.
- Thematic analysis: AI/ML accelerator updates, GPU/DPU market positioning, data-center demand, supply chain/news events, competition (e.g., Nvidia/Intel), and macro factors.
- News crosswalk: summary of relevant AMD announcements, earnings calls, and analyst notes; sentiment impact assessment.
- Risk/Opportunity assessment for traders:
  - Short-term catalysts (volatility triggers, product launches, contract wins)
  - Structural risks (supply chain, AI demand cycles, competition)
  - Sentiment-driven scenarios (how sentiment could pivot on a negative/positive news item)
- Quant actionable takeaways: if/when to consider entries, exits, or hedges based on sentiment signals and news flow.
- Limitations and data gaps: note any gaps due to tool issues or source limitations.

Markdown table template (end of report)
- You asked for a Markdown table; here’s a ready-to-fill scaffold you can paste once data is available. I’ll populate it with real numbers and observations after the Reddit data comes back.

| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Day’s Sentiment | Top Themes | Notable Posts/Engagement (count) | AMD News/Narrative Impact | Possible Trading Implications |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 2025-09-07 | Neutral to Slightly Positive | AI accelerators, data-center demand | 12 posts; high engagement around product roadmap | Product launch/closes or partnership update | Watch for short-term price drift; potential for pullback if sentiment fades |
| 2025-09-08 | … | … | … | … | … |
| 2025-09-09 | … | … | … | … | … |

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with this skeleton and a best-effort analysis using other public signals while I wait for the Reddit tool to come back? If you have a preferred date window (e.g., last 5 days or last 7–10 days) or any specific subreddits to emphasize (e.g., r/AMD, r/investing), tell me and I’ll tailor the framework accordingly.
