Sorry about that. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit-based sentiment data for SPY (2025-09-08) but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError on the backend. It looks like a temporary issue with the data service.

What I can do now
- Retry the Reddit data fetch in a moment (or a few minutes) and then proceed with the full, detailed long report as requested.
- If you prefer, I can start with a qualitative, high-signal analysis using other publicly available inputs (macro news, general market sentiment indicators, and typical SPY drivers) and clearly label it as qualitative until the Reddit data tool is back up.

Please choose one:
1) Retry now and then generate the full long report (with a Markdown summary table at the end) as soon as the data comes back.
2) Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using non-Reddit sources for SPY over the past week, and outline the exact points I’d verify once the Reddit tool is available.

If you want me to proceed with option 2 right away, I’ll produce:
- An overview of what SPY reflects given macro and market drivers around 2025-09-08.
- A sentiment snapshot (qualitative) across major social platforms (Reddit, X, forums) based on recent themes (e.g., macro prompts, inflation expectations, Fed commentary, geopolitical headlines) without claiming specific post counts or sentiment scores.
- A news digest focusing on the past week’s headlines that would plausibly move SPY.
- Trader-oriented takeaways, including short- to medium-term scenarios, key caveats, and risk flags.
- A final Markdown table consolidating key points.

Tell me which path you’d like, and I’ll proceed.
