Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch PLTR data and run the stock-stat indicators, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError (Internal data path issue). I’m not able to generate the actual current-trend signals from PLTR at the moment. If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now, try a narrower date range, or proceed with a robust indicator framework using PLTR as the target and fill in the concrete signals once the data loads. In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of indicators and how they’ll help analyze PLTR when the data is available.

Recommended indicators (up to 8) for PLTR
- close_50_sma: 50-period simple moving average
  - What it measures: intermediate-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  - Why for PLTR: helps identify whether PLTR is in an established uptrend or downtrend, useful for timing entries with trend direction
- close_200_sma: 200-period simple moving average
  - What it measures: long-term trend benchmark
  - Why for PLTR: confirms broader market regime (golden cross vs death cross with shorter moving averages)
- close_10_ema: 10-period exponential moving average
  - What it measures: short-term momentum
  - Why for PLTR: captures quick shifts in momentum; useful for early entry/exit signals when used with longer moving averages
- macd: MACD line
  - What it measures: momentum via differences between short/long EMAs
  - Why for PLTR: crossovers with the signal line indicate potential trend changes; divergence with price can warn of trend weakening or reversal
- macds: MACD Signal
  - What it measures: smoothed MACD line
  - Why for PLTR: helps filter MACD cross signals; a MACD vs MACD Signal crossover adds a confirmation layer
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  - What it measures: momentum strength by showing the gap between MACD and its signal
  - Why for PLTR: divergence in histogram can precede price moves; useful in tightening risk management during choppiness
- rsi: RSI
  - What it measures: momentum with overbought/oversold context
  - Why for PLTR: 70/30 thresholds help flag potential reversals; watch for RSI divergences in conjunction with trend
- atr: Average True Range
  - What it measures: market volatility
  - Why for PLTR: informs position sizing and stop placement; high ATR suggests wider stops and vice versa; complements price-based signals with risk control

Rationale and how to interpret for PLTR
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to establish whether PLTR is in a macro uptrend (price above both, potential golden cross) or downtrend (price below both, potential death cross). In an uptrend, prioritize bullish MACD signals and RSI not in overbought territory; in a downtrend, expect pullbacks to meet resistance at SMAs and look for bearish MACD signals.
- Momentum signals: MACD and its components (macd, macds, macdh) will help you gauge the strength and timing of moves. Positive MACD crossovers with rising histogram support entries in uptrends; negative crossovers and a shrinking histogram support exits in downtrends.
- Short-term timing: The 10 EMA can help catch quicker swing shifts in PLTR’s price, but in highly volatile or range-bound markets it can produce false signals if used alone. Pair with MACD/rsi for confirmation.
- Volatility and risk: ATR will guide stop placement and position sizing—PLTR’s volatility can expand sharply around catalysts; use ATR to avoid under- or over-sizing risk.
- Overbought/oversold nuance: RSI is most informative when the price is not in a strong trend. In a strong uptrend, RSI can stay overbought for a while; in a trend reversal scenario, RSI divergence with price can precede a turn.

Practical usage notes for PLTR (when data is available)
- Look for a bullish setup: price above 50_SMA and 200_SMA, golden cross (50_SMA crossing above 200_SMA), MACD line above signal, RSI non-extreme or modestly overbought, ATR indicating manageable volatility for the entry window.
- Look for a cautionary/bearish setup: price below 50_SMA and 200_SMA, death cross appears, MACD line crossing below the signal, RSI failing to make new highs while price climbs (bearish divergence), ATR rising indicating increasing volatility that could imply breakouts or breakdowns.
- Risk controls: use ATR to set stop distance (e.g., 1.0–2.0x current ATR) and adjust position size to a target risk per trade. Confirm signals with at least one other indicator (e.g., MACD + RSI or price/MA alignment) to reduce false positives.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching PLTR data now, or you can specify a narrower date range (e.g., last 6–12 months) to reduce data volume and potential issues.
- Alternatively, if you’d like, I can provide a fully filled-out analysis framework (including expected signal interpretations and a decision-tree) that’ll be ready to populate as soon as data loads.

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and PLTR usage
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for PLTR | Signals to monitor (PLTR context) |
|-----------|----------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Intermediate-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Confirm trend direction; use as primary trend filter | Price above = potential uptrend; price crossing above/below 50_SMA for entries/exits |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirm macro regime; look for golden/death cross with 50_SMA | Golden cross: 50_SMA above 200_SMA; Death cross: 50_SMA below 200_SMA |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Fast momentum cue; use with longer MA filters | Price above/below 10_EMA signaling short-term shifts; cross with price around key levels |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMA differences | Core momentum signal; watch crossovers with MACD_Signal | MACD > MACD_Signal (bullish); MACD < MACD_Signal (bearish) |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line | Confirmation filter for MACD cross signals | MACD crosses above/below MACD_Signal; simultaneous histogram shift strengthens signal |
| macdh | MACD Related | MACD histogram momentum strength | Divergence and strength indicator | Increasing histo in uptrend supports momentum; negative histo warns of weakening momentum |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum with overbought/oversold levels | Filter for reversal risk in context of trend | RSI > 70 (overbought) or RSI < 30 (oversold); watch for divergences in trend |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility for risk management | Set stops, adjust position size; interpret volatility regime | Rising ATR implies wider stops; falling ATR suggests tighter risk controls |

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now, or adjust the indicators set (e.g., swap one MACD component for VWMA or Bollinger bands to capture volatility/volume signals), tell me your preference and I’ll proceed accordingly as soon as the data path issue is resolved.
