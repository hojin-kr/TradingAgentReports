Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to pull the latest Reddit/social-sentiment feed for PLTR, but the tool call is returning a FileNotFoundError in this session. I retried a few times, but the issue persists. I can proceed in two ways:

- Option A: Continue with a comprehensive qualitative framework and clearly labeled data gaps, so you have a solid, ready-to-fill analysis once the data tool is available.
- Option B: Use any alternative data you can provide (e.g., a few top Reddit post summaries or a pasted link list) to produce a more data-driven report in this session.

Below is a robust, long-form analytical framework you can use right away, along with a detailed plan for what I will produce once the Reddit sentiment data feed is accessible. I’ve included a Markdown table at the end that you can copy into a report.

What I would deliver (framework and placeholders)

1) Current status and data limitations
- Data gap: Reddit/social sentiment data for PLTR for the past 7 days is not accessible in this session due to a tool error.
- Impact: Without live sentiment counts, post-level themes, and day-by-day sentiment deltas, I cannot present numerically anchored sentiment scores or topic trends. However, the structure below will be populated immediately once data is retrievable.

2) Comprehensive analysis plan (what I will analyze and how)
A. Social sentiment overview (past 7 days)
- Net sentiment score: aggregate bullish vs bearish posts, normalized by volume.
- Daily sentiment delta: day-to-day changes (e.g., +12 points on Tue, -5 on Wed).
- Engagement signals: average post reactions (comments, upvotes) as a proxy for conviction.

B. Top themes and drivers (based on text mining if available)
- AI/automation/utilization: mentions of Palantir’s AI/data platforms, copilots, workflow automation.
- Government/enterprise contracts: mentions of public-sector projects, client wins, renewals, or churn.
- Valuation and risk: considerations around multiples, profitability trajectory, capex, and runway.
- Regulation/privacy/security: data governance concerns, compliance news, or scrutiny.
- Competitors and substitutes: mentions of competitors (e.g., other data analytics/AI players) and comparative performance.

C. News and event alignment
- Cross-check: any earnings calls, contract announcements, partnerships, regulatory notices, or major press coverage in the week.
- Catalyst mapping: match sentiment shifts to specific news events (e.g., a large contract win aligns with bullish sentiment; a data-breach concern aligns with bearish chatter).

D. Price-sentiment relationship (conceptual plan)
- Correlation expectations: bullish sentiment tends to precede upside moves or support, bearish sentiment can precede pullbacks or increased volatility.
- Time horizon: intraday to 5-7 day lookback windows, with sensitivity to news releases.

E. Risk and anomaly checks
- Noise vs signal: filter out low-quality posts, identify potential misinformation or coordinated amplification.
- Rotating topics: see if sentiment is concentrated in a few hot topics or broadly distributed.

F. Practical takeaways for traders
- Key sentiment inflection points to watch: thresholds where net sentiment crosses a prior peak/trough, or where daily delta flips direction.
- Catalyst housekeeping: which upcoming events (if any) could validate or invalidate current sentiment.
- Positioning cues: guidance on entry/exit points as sentiment corroborates or diverges from price action.

3) Reporting structure (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: one-page sentiment score, dominant theme, and headline takeaway.
- Day-by-day breakdown: date, net sentiment, post volume, top five themes, notable posts.
- Topic heatmap: bullish vs bearish theme counts and their growth/decay over the week.
- Price context: closing price, intraday range, and recent price changes relative to sentiment shifts.
- Risk flags: data quality notes, potential manipulation, or outlier spikes.
- Trader guidance: calibrated watchlist levels, triggers for potential entries/exits, and risk controls.

4) How to fill the data gaps quickly
- If you can provide:
  - A CSV/JSON export of the past 7 days of sentiment (date, post_count, bullish_count, bearish_count, top_themes).
  - A list of top 10-20 posts with brief summaries or URLs.
- I will immediately convert that into a full, quantitative sentiment report with day-by-day breakdowns, calculated deltas, and actionable trading implications.

5) Next steps
- I can retry the Reddit sentiment tool in a fresh session if you’d like me to keep attempting, or you can provide an alternate data sample (top posts or a summary).
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, narrative-oriented analysis now (no numerical sentiment scores) and clearly label where data would be inserted once available.

Markdown report table (key points and next actions)

| Section | What I will deliver | Data needs / Next steps |
|---|---|---|
| Data status | Tool error acknowledged; data gap noted | Await Reddit sentiment feed (PLTR, past 7 days) or user-provided data |
| Sentiment overview | Net sentiment, daily deltas, engagement proxy | Requires daily counts of bullish/bearish posts and volumes |
| Top themes | Dominant topics (AI, gov contracts, regulation, etc.) | Topic-weighted counts per day; post summarizations |
| News alignment | Catalyst mapping (news events to sentiment shifts) | List of weekly news items and dates |
| Price-sentiment relation | Conceptual correlation framework (to be populated) | Price data for same window once sentiment is available |
| Risk flags | Noise vs signal, data quality notes | Quality checks; note potential manipulation |
| Trader guidance | Inflection points, triggers, risk controls | Trigger thresholds once data is populated |
| Next steps | Retry tool or accept alternative data source | Choose between retry or data provision |

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option A (structured qualitative analysis now, clearly labeled data gaps) or Option B (you provide a data subset for a more concrete, data-driven report). Just tell me which path you prefer, and whether you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch in the next message.
