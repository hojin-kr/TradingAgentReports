Verdict: Buy with disciplined, gate-driven execution.

What backs this decision
- Core thesis alignment: The plan’s bull case—Foundry/Gotham moat, AI-enabled adoption, and multi-vertical commercial expansion—maps to a durable, potentially higher-quality ARR trajectory. If commercial mix expands and margins follow, the valuation could become more defensible over time.
- Manageable risks with guardrails: The plan explicitly acknowledges valuation, profitability timing, and macro risk, but provides a clear, data-backed framework to scale into strength rather than chase hype. The payoff remains asymmetric if ARR mix improves and operating leverage kicks in.
- Catalysts and visibility: AIPCon momentum, cross-sell velocity from Lear/Lumen, and durable government momentum offer checkable catalysts that can translate into pipeline and revenue resilience, reducing downside risk relative to hype-driven moves.

Execution playbook (two-tier, risk-controlled)
Tier 1 entry (initiation)
- Entry trigger: Confirm uptrend with price action above key moving-average confluence (e.g., 50-day > 200-day) and positive momentum signals (MACD positive, RSI not overbought).
- Position sizing: 1-2% of portfolio capital allocated to Tier 1.
- Stop: ATR-based stop, set at 1.5x ATR from entry (adjusts for volatility).
- Objective: Validate trend durability and catalyst alignment before adding.

Tier 2 add-on (conditional expansion)
- Trigger for Tier 2: Visible, multi-quarter improvements in ARR mix (commercial ARR acceleration), gross margin expansion, and a decline in SBC as a percentage of revenue; plus continued evidence of catalysts translating into pipeline.
- Tier 2 sizing: Smaller than Tier 1 (e.g., 0.5-1% of portfolio) and only if Tier 1 proves the setup and catalysts remain in force.
- Continue using ATR-based stops and tighten if momentum wanes.

Risk controls and position management
- Cap exposure per trade: 1-2% per Tier 1, with total exposure to PLTR restricted to 5-10% of the growth sleeve until profitability signals are clearly trending positive.
- Profit-taking plan: Scale out into strength at defined resistance levels or deteriorating momentum signals, while retaining a core to ride the longer-term trend.
- Contingency: If ARR growth stalls or gross margins stagnate over several quarters, reduce exposure quickly or exit to preserve capital.

Key metrics and data to monitor (data-driven milestones)
- ARR growth and mix: Sustained acceleration in commercial ARR and rising high-quality ARR contribution.
- Margin trajectory: Gross margin expansion trend and a declining SBC-to-revenue ratio.
- Cash flow signal: Movement toward positive operating cash flow or reduced cash burn.
- Customer/cross-sell momentum: New customers, higher average contract values, and cross-sell velocity within existing client base.
- Catalyst cadence: Sustainable pipeline growth tied to AIPCon adoption and Lear/Lumen deployments, not just press mentions.

Contingency and risk management
- If ARR growth stalls or margins fail to improve, tighten risk controls immediately: reduce exposure, trim gains, or exit to protect capital.
- If macro/AI-policy headlines worsen multiples, rely on predefined profit-taking and scale-back rules while you await clearer profitability signals.
- If insider selling accelerates without fundamental backing, reassess conviction and adjust position sizing accordingly.

Bottom line
- Recommendation: Buy, but with disciplined, rule-based execution and explicit gates on profitability and margin progress.
- Why this stance: A durable AI infrastructure platform with real cross-sell potential and improving commercial mix offers a credible path to higher ARR and improved margins over time. Risks are real but manageable with a well-defined entry/exit framework and risk caps.

If you want, I can plug in live data (current moving averages, MACD, RSI, ATR, ARR mix, insider moves) to refine price targets and threshold levels in real time.
