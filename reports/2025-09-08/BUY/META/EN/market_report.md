I attempted to fetch META data via Yahoo Finance for 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-08, but the data backend returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry or fetch alternative ranges, but right now I don’t have the price series to run the indicators. If you’d like, I can proceed with a rigorous, framework-based analysis using the 8 selected indicators and fill in concrete conclusions as soon as data retrieval succeeds. Below is a detailed, nuanced plan and the exact indicators I recommend using for META, along with how to interpret them once the data is available.

Recommended indicators (8 total) for META
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale for indicator selection
- close_50_sma (Moving Average): Captures the medium-term trend and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming the prevailing direction and for spotting pullbacks within an uptrend or rallies within a downtrend.
- close_200_sma (Moving Average): Establishes the long-term trend baseline. Golden/death cross dynamics (e.g., 50 SMA crossing above/below 200 SMA) can indicate enduring regime shifts. Helpful for longer- horizon bias.
- close_10_ema (Moving Average): Provides a responsive view of near-term momentum. Useful to flag quick shifts in price action, potential entry points, or pullbacks that might be followed by a trend continuation when aligned with longer-term averages.
- macd (MACD): Core momentum indicator showing differences between two EMAs. Crossovers of the MACD line and signal line offer potential trend-change signals; stronger when accompanied by other filters.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Visualizes momentum strength and divergence tendencies. Positive/expanding histogram supports bullish momentum; negative/contracting histogram supports bearish momentum. Helpful to confirm or question MACD cross signals.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum gauge that highlights overbought/oversold conditions (commonly 70/30 thresholds) and potential reversals. Divergence with price can forewarn reversals, especially when aligned with trend context from moving averages.
- atr (ATR): Measures volatility, informing risk controls like stop placement and position sizing. Rising ATR suggests expanding volatility (potential breakouts or volatile reversals); falling ATR suggests consolidation.
- vwma (VWMA): Volume-weighted trend confirmation. Combines price action with volume to validate moves. A price move above/below VWMA with supportive volume adds conviction to trend signals.

How these indicators complement each other
- Trend confirmation (50 SMA, 200 SMA) + momentum signals (MACD, MACD Histogram, RSI) + short-term momentum (10 EMA) creates a layered view: trend direction, momentum acceleration/deceleration, and potential entry/exit timing.
- ATR adds a volatility/risk management layer, ensuring position sizing and stop levels adjust to market conditions.
- VWMA adds a volume-confirmation dimension, helping distinguish genuine moves from price noise.

How to interpret in META-specific contexts (framework; placeholders until data is available)
- Uptrend scenario:
  - Price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with 50 SMA above 200 SMA.
  - MACD line above the signal line, MACD histogram positive and expanding.
  - RSI moving higher but not yet overbought; look for any bullish divergence with price as a potential continuation signal.
  - Price trading above VWMA with rising volume; ATR rising modestly confirms room for a breakout, but use ATR to set wider but sensible stops.
- Sideways/mean-reversion scenario:
  - Price hovering around 50 and 200 SMAs with potential crossovers near the midline.
  - MACD crossing toward neutral or histogram flattening; RSI oscillating within 40–60 range with no clear divergence.
  - VWMA fluctuating around price with inconsistent volume; ATR compressing indicates lower volatility. In this regime, wait for a decisive MACD/histogram or a breakout above/below key levels tied to SMAs.
- Downtrend scenario:
  - Price below both SMAs, with 50 SMA crossing below 200 SMA (death cross) or persistent below both.
  - MACD below signal line; MACD histogram negative and widening.
  - RSI dipping toward or below 30, potential oversold rebound only if a bullish MACD/RSI confluence occurs with volume-supported moves (VWMA) and a widening ATR in the downside breakout context.
- Breakout/trend-resumption signals:
  - Price breaking above resistance near the 50 and 200 SMA cluster with MACD turning positive; MACD histogram increasing; RSI not in overbought territory yet.
  - VWMA showing above-average volume on the breakout adds conviction; ATR rising would imply a more sustainable move rather than a brief spike.

Operational plan (how I’ll analyze once data is available)
1) Retrieve META price data for the desired window (and additional look-back to capture regime changes).
2) Compute the 8 indicators exactly as named.
3) Produce a consolidated readout:
   - Trend assessment from 50 SMA and 200 SMA.
   - Momentum signals from MACD, MACD Histogram, and RSI.
   - Volatility and risk from ATR.
   - Volume-confirmed price action from VWMA.
4) Provide entry/exit considerations with concrete signal criteria (e.g., bullish setup if price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA, MACD bullish cross with rising histogram, RSI not overbought, VWMA confirms, and ATR rising).
5) Include caveats for false positives (e.g., choppy markets can trigger MACD cross signals that are not sustained; use multi-indicator confirmation).

Proposed reporting format (what you’ll get when data is available)
- A narrative overview of META’s price action in the period, with emphasis on how each indicator behaved and what it signaled.
- A section-by-section interpretation for bullish, neutral, and bearish scenarios based on current readings.
- A concise action plan with potential entry/exit ideas aligned to risk management (stop placement guided by ATR).
- A final summary table (see Markdown table below) that maps each indicator to its interpretation and decision signals.

Would you like me to retry data retrieval now (potentially with a shorter date window or a fresh start date) so I can provide concrete indicator values and a data-backed interpretation? If you prefer, I can proceed with this framework and deliver the full interpretation once the data fetch succeeds, or you can provide any available price data for META to enable immediate calculation. 

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and signals (to include in the final data-driven report)
| Indicator | Category | Purpose for META | Key Signals to Watch |
|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA; 50SMA slope; cross with price |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation | Price above/below 200SMA; 50SMA vs 200SMA cross (golden/death) |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Near-term momentum; quick shifts | Price above/below 10EMA; 10EMA slope; cross with price |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and potential trend changes | MACD line above/below signal; crossovers; magnitude of histogram |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence cues | Histogram positive/negative and expanding/contracting |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context; reversals | RSI >70 or <30; divergence with price; slope direction |
| atr | Volatility | Volatility regime and risk management; stop sizing | ATR rising (more volatility) or falling (calmer); relative to recent ranges |
| vwma | Volume-based | Volume-confirmed price action; trend validation | Price above/below VWMA with rising volume; VWMA cross with price |

If you’d like, I can attempt the data retrieval again now and then deliver a full, data-driven interpretation using these 8 indicators.
