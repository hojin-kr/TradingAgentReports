Recommendation now: Hold META.

Rationale
- The provided plan presents a balanced view: AI-enabled monetization could lift ARPU and monetization breadth, but near-term margins remain vulnerable to AI-related opex, macro ad-demand cycles, and Reality Labs drag. Given these competing forces, a decisive upside is not guaranteed in the near term, while downside catalysts (margin compression, regulatory headwinds) remain plausible. Hold preserves exposure to potential AI upside while maintaining guardrails.

What would push the thesis decisively one way
- To upgrade to Buy: clear, sustained multi-quarter acceleration in AI-driven ad revenue and ARPU, with gross/operating margins stabilizing or expanding after AI infra investments; early signs that Reality Labs drag is diminishing or monetizing meaningfully; regulatory clarity that meaningfully reduces overhangs.
- To downgrade to Sell: persistent ad-revenue/ARPU deceleration despite AI initiatives; meaningful and persistent margin compression for multiple quarters; continued drag from Reality Labs with cash flow impact; material regulatory constraints on targeting or cross-app data use that erode monetization efficiency.

Strategic actions (as per the plan)
- Pre-defined triggers remain: upgrade to Buy on sustained ARPU growth and margin stability; downgrade to Sell on sustained deceleration in ad revenue/ARPU or persistent margin pressure.
- Risk controls: ATR-based stops; layered exposure (core hold with hedges around key catalysts); disciplined position sizing to preserve capital for potential future move to Buy or Sell.
- Catalyst monitoring: earnings guidance revisions, AI initiative milestones, Reality Labs cadence, regulatory developments, engagement metrics (MAUs/DAUs, Reels, shopping uptake).

Data-gap approach
- If data is limited, maintain Hold with hedging around catalysts. Re-score promptly when new data arrives.

Learning note
- This stance emphasizes patience and verification: hold until durable evidence of margin resilience and AI-driven monetization acceleration appears across multiple quarters.
