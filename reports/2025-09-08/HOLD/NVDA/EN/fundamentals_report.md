I’m running into a system error pulling the data right now. All attempted tool calls (balance sheet, cash flow, income statement, insider sentiment, and insider transactions for NVDA) returned a FileNotFoundError. I retried in parallel and individually, but the issue persists. This looks like an environment/config problem rather than a data issue from NVDA itself.

What I can do next
- I can retry the data pulls a few minutes from now if you’d like.
- If you prefer, I can switch to a manual/qualitative analysis using publicly available context (without the exact latest quarterly figures) and outline what to look for once the data tools are back online.
- Alternatively, I can continue with a structured report using placeholders and clearly labeled data gaps, so when the data tools are accessible again, we can drop in the exact numbers and update the insights.

What I’ll deliver once the data is accessible
- A comprehensive fundamental report for NVDA covering:
  - Company profile and business model (core segments, end markets, competitive landscape)
  - Recent financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) with trend lines and fine-grained metrics (revenue growth, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, FCF)
  - Balance sheet health (assets, liabilities, liquidity, liquidity ratios, debt levels, pension/other long-term obligations if relevant)
  - Cash flow health (cash flow from operations, capex intensity, free cash flow, financing activities)
  - Key profitability and efficiency metrics (ROE, ROA, ROIC, gross/operating/net margins, asset turnover)
  - Revenue/cost structure and drivers (product mix,Geographic mix, AI/data-center demand, memory/shift in supply)
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions (net sentiment over the past 30 days, notable purchases/sales, potential signaling)
  - Risk factors and catalysts (AI demand trajectory, supply chain, competition, regulatory/compliance, geopolitical/foreign exchange)
  - Trading implications and scenarios (base case, bull case, bear case with trigger events)
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key takeaways and metrics for quick reference

Proposed next step
- Do you want me to keep retrying the data pulls now and then produce the full report as soon as I retrieve the latest quarterly data? If yes, I’ll attempt again in a moment and then deliver the full, detailed report with a complete data-backed analysis and the final summary table.

If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative framework right away (without the latest numeric pulls) and clearly label where data gaps would be filled once the tools are back online. Which option would you like?
