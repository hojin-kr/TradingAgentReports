Recommendation: Buy.

Rationale (why this aligns with the plan)
- The bull case for NVDA remains compelling: a durable AI data-center upgrade cycle, a real moat through CUDA and a growing software/ecosystem, and strong free cash flow that supports multiple expansion resilience.
- Near-term headwinds exist (valuation, regulatory/china exposure, macro sensitivity), but they’re addressable with disciplined, staged entry and risk controls. The plan’s 8-indicator framework provides concrete signals to time entries and manage risk, reducing the chance of buying a transient move.
- A staged-entry approach lets you participate in upside while limiting downside, consistent with the plan’s risk framework.

Proposed execution (Stage-based, starting now)
Stage 1 – Initial long tranche
- Entry signals (confirm momentum and trend):
  - Price above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages
  - MACD bullish crossover
  - VWMA volume confirms breakout
- Position sizing: ~25% of the intended full NVDA exposure relative to your risk budget
- Risk controls: ATR-based stop at ~1.0–1.5x ATR below entry; consider a trailing stop if the position moves in your favor
- Rationale: validates trend participation by institutions and aligns with your staged-entry discipline

Stage 2 – Add-on on favorable pullback (optional)
- Trigger conditions:
  - Price pulls back toward meaningful support (near rising 50-SMA or pullback staying above rising 10-EMA)
  - Momentum re-confirmed: RSI not overbought, MACD re-affirming
- Action: add another 25–30% of target exposure
- Rationale: improves risk-reward by entering on resilience, not chasing strength

Stage 3 – Final scalability on strength
- Trigger conditions:
  - Decisive breakout above a key resistance level with above-average VWMA volume
- Action: complete to full planned exposure (remaining 40–50%)
- Risk controls: tighten/stay aligned with trailing stop and moving stop levels to protect gains

Risk management and hedging
- Optional hedges: collar (long NVDA, long put, short call) or protective puts with staggered expiries to shield against near-term volatility
- Hard drawdown limit: cap individual NVDA position drawdown at 2–3% of portfolio value before reassessing or hedging more aggressively
- If bear signals cluster (MACD deterioration, RSI divergence, failure to sustain above key SMAs on high volume, rising ATR with downside days), tighten risk or exit

Targets and monitoring
- View outcomes in milestones over 1–3 months, not single price targets
- Continuously monitor for bear signals and be prepared to scale back or hedge if the 8-indicator signals deteriorate

Notes
- If you want, I can tailor exact sizing, stop levels, and trigger thresholds to your portfolio size, risk tolerance, and time horizon, and adapt rules as new NVDA data arrives.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
