I attempted to fetch NVDA data with the provided tool, but I hit a system error (FileNotFoundError) from the data retrieval step. I can proceed in two ways:

- Way A: Wait for the data retrieval issue to be resolved and then run the full 8-indicator analysis with the latest NVDA data.
- Way B: Proceed now with a robust indicator framework (8 indicators) and a detailed interpretation plan using the assumption that data will be fed in once the retrieval issue is fixed.

If you’d like me to proceed immediately with Way B (indicator framework and interpretation plan), here are the 8 selected indicators and why they’re suitable for NVDA in a typical AI/semiconductor market context.

Selected indicators (8)
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Captures short-term momentum shifts; responsive to rapid price moves, good for early entry/exit signals in NVDA’s volatile environment.
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps filter noise from the short-term moves.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Long-term trend baseline; useful for confirming major trend direction and spotting golden/death-cross tendencies when combined with other indicators.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Momentum and trend-change signals via crossovers of MACD line and signal line; complementary to price-based moving averages.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Momentum strength visualization through histogram; helps identify divergence and acceleration/deceleration in NVDA’s moves.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Why: Overbought/oversold context and potential reversals; useful for spotting exhaustion in strong uptrends that NVDA often exhibits.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Why: Measures market volatility; supports risk management, position sizing, and stop placement in a high-volatility stock like NVDA.
- vwma
  - Category: Volume-Based Indicators
  - Why: Confirms price action with volume; helps validate breakouts or pullbacks with institutional/volume-driven participation.

Rationale and how to use (NVDA context)
- Trend and momentum blend: The 10_EMA, 50_SMA, and 200_SMA provide a layered view of short, mid, and long-term trends. When the price sits above the 50/200 SMA, it supports a bullish bias; however, a drop below the 50 for NVDA can signal a momentum shift that may precede a trend change. The 10_EMA helps catch quicker shifts to act on pullbacks or bounces within the broader trend.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and MACD Histogram (macd and macdh) together give a robust sense of momentum shifts. A MACD line crossing above the signal line (with positive macdh) can support potential entries in the direction of the prevailing trend; a bearish cross or expanding negative histogram may caution against new longs.
- Momentum exhaustion and reversal risk: RSI complements trend/momentum signals by highlighting overbought conditions in strong uptrends and potential reversals if RSI diverges from price action (e.g., price making a new high while RSI fails to), which is valuable for NVDA’s volatile moves around AI/semiconductor catalysts.
- Volatility and risk management: ATR guides stop-loss placement and position sizing, important for NVDA given its typical wide-range days around earnings, product launches, or AI market catalysts.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA helps assess whether price moves are supported by high-volume participation, a useful filter for breakouts or declines that lack conviction.

Key trading considerations and scenarios (outline)
- Bullish setup: Price above 50/200 SMA, 10_EMA trending up, MACD positive with a rising histogram (macd/macdh), RSI not in overbought territory, ATR rising (increased volatility but manageable risk), and volume-supported moves (VWMA confirms breakouts).
- Bearish or risk-off setup: Price failing to sustain above key moving averages, MACD crossing down with a negative histogram, RSI rolling over from overbought or showing bearish divergence, ATR increasing with price weakness, VWMA showing weak volume on price declines.
- Alternatives to watch: If NVDA is in a strong uptrend but experiences a pullback, the 10_EMA can provide entry timing within the context of the 50/200 SMA trend, while MACD/macdh can help confirm whether this pullback is a pause or a trend reversal.

Next steps
- If you want me to run the full analysis with live data, please try re-fetching NVDA data (the tool error may be temporary), and I’ll deliver:
  - A detailed trend report using the 8 indicators above
  - Specific entry/exit ideas with example signals
  - A concise risk-management framework tailored to NVDA’s typical risk profile
- If you prefer, I can proceed using a current snapshot or a specified date range you provide, and generate the interpretation framework with those values.
