Apologies — I hit an error fetching Reddit data for NVDA: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the Reddit stock-info tool is currently unavailable. I can proceed in two ways:

Option A — Retry later / keep trying:
- I’ll retry fetching the latest Reddit data for NVDA as soon as the tool is accessible and then deliver a full, data-backed report.

Option B — Proceed without live Reddit data (best-effort qualitative analysis):
- I’ll produce a comprehensive NVDA sentiment/news analysis framework based on public signals and typical drivers, clearly labeling where data is inferred or awaiting confirmation. If you’d like, I can also pull in data from alternative signals you specify (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, news headlines) if you have access.

What I can deliver right now (Option B, no live Reddit data):
- A detailed analysis framework for traders and investors covering NVDA over the past week, with fine-grained insights, potential implications, and actionable takes.
- A Markdown table at the end to organize key points for quick reference.

What the full report will cover (structure you’ll get once data is available, or if you approve proceeding now with best-effort data):
- Day-by-day sentiment snapshot: whether sentiment trended bullish, bearish, or mixed on each day, and notable drivers behind shifts.
- Core sentiment themes: AI demand expectations, GPU supply/demand dynamics, data-center capex, product cycle news, competition, regulatory or geopolitical risks.
- News tailwinds vs headwinds from the past week: earnings commentary, partnerships, product announcements, guide revisions, supply chain updates, legal/regulatory items.
- Volatility and momentum indicators: implied volatilities, option activity signals around NVDA, and any notable divergences from price.
- Trader-oriented implications: how sentiment shifts could affect short-, mid-, and long-term positioning; key levels to watch; risk factors (earnings risk, supply constraints, macro AI cycles).
- Sources and data quality notes: red flags, gaps due to data sourcing, and how I’d triangulate Reddit data with other signals to improve confidence.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option B now, I’ll proceed with a thorough qualitative analysis and provide a structured report plus a Markdown summary table. Alternatively, tell me if you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch right away and then deliver the full data-backed report once it succeeds.
