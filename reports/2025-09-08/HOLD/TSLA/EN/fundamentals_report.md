I attempted to fetch TSLA data for insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement, but I’m currently hitting a FileNotFoundError from the data tools. I can’t retrieve the datasets right now. Here are your options:

- Option A: Retry data retrieval now (I’ll re-run the same tools as soon as the environment allows) and then deliver a full, data-driven report.
- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort fundamentals framework for TSLA, clearly labeled as placeholders until the data tools come back online, plus a detailed methodology and a ready-to-fill Markdown table for you to drop in Zahlen once they’re available.

If you want me to proceed with Option B now, here’s what I’ll provide:

What I will deliver (framework for a comprehensive TSLA fundamentals report)
- Company profile
  - Business model summary (vehicles, energy, services, AI/robotaxi potential)
  - geographic exposure and major markets
  - Key strategic initiatives (production ramp, new platforms, energy products, software/services)
- Revenue and profitability overview (as data becomes available)
  - Quarterly and annual revenue by segment (Vehicle, Energy, Services)
  - Gross margin, operating margin, net margin
  - Earnings quality and non-operating items
- Balance sheet snapshot (most recent period)
  - Assets vs. liabilities, liquidity metrics (current ratio, quick ratio)
  - Net debt position and financing structure
  - Capex intensity and asset base evolution
- Cash flow analysis
  - Operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash conversion cycle
  - Capex cadence and ROIC/EBITDA-style proxies
- Key financial ratios and trend analysis
  - Profitability, efficiency, leverage, liquidity
  - Growth metrics (revenue CAGR, earnings trajectory)
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (structure to interpret once data is available)
  - Short-run sentiment signal (color-coded interpretation)
  - Notable insider buys/sells and potential implications
- Historical and peer context
  - Trajectory vs. EV peers (GM, Ford, NIO, BYD, etc.) on profitability and balance sheet durability
  - Industry macro drivers (EV demand, commodity costs, supply chain resilience)
- Risk factors and caveats
  - Production ramp risks, supply chain constraints, regulatory considerations, pricing/margin pressures
- Trader-oriented takeaways
  - What to watch in coming quarters
  - Potential catalysts and red flags
- Appendices
  - Definitions of metrics used
  - Data-source notes and data-quality caveats

Proposed Markdown table (ready to populate with actual data once tools are back)

Next steps
- Tell me which option you prefer (Retry now vs. proceed with the framework).
- If you want me to retry, I’ll re-run the tool calls as soon as the environment permits and deliver a fully data-backed report with the Markdown table at the end.
- If you want the framework now, I’ll flesh out each section with qualitative notes, and I’ll continuously fill in numbers and trend insights as soon as the data tools are accessible again.

Would you like me to retry immediately, or proceed with the framework (Option B) and populate it once data tools are restored?
