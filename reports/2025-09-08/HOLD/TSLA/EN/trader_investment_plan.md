Recommendation: HOLD

Rationale
- The provided plan rightly flags meaningful near-term risks (Europe/India demand softness, regulatory/tax-credit shifts, and uncertainty around autonomy monetization) alongside a compelling long-term optionality story (software/services, data flywheel, energy ecosystem). Without clear, multi-point validation, a cautious Hold remains the most defensible stance.
- A Hold preserves optionality while avoiding over-committing to upside that hinges on uncertain near-term milestones. It also keeps capital available for deployment once multi-signal confirmation occurs.

Risk-managed play and execution guidance
- If you’re already long:
  - Maintain a modest exposure (roughly 2–4% of portfolio) and implement disciplined risk controls (e.g., trailing stop, ATR-based stops, align stops with recent support).
  - Consider a defensive hedge (collar or long puts) if you’re adding near-term exposure or if volatility remains elevated.
- If you’re flat or light:
  - Avoid chasing; wait for data-confirmed entry signals tied to the framework (trend + momentum + credible monetization signals).
- What would move the stance to Buy:
  - Sustained uptrend with positive momentum, plus credible near-term monetization progress (pricing models, utilization metrics, revenue-sharing pilots) and stabilization/enhancement of Europe/India demand, with regulatory risk easing.
- What would move the stance to Sell:
  - A meaningful deterioration in price action (downtrend with negative momentum), failure to see credible autonomy monetization progress in the near term, worsening Europe/India demand, or heightened governance/regulatory concerns.

Catalysts and review cadence
- Monitor: regional demand prints (Europe/India), China sales trajectory, autonomy/AI monetization milestones, regulatory updates, and governance disclosures.
- Review cadence: weekly signal assessment and position-sizing adjustments; update risk dashboard as new data arrives.

Note on learning from decisions
- Do not rely on a single catalyst. Require multi-signal confirmation before escalating exposure. Maintain explicit risk controls and be prepared to re-evaluate quickly if catalysts falter.

Final call
- Hold now while staying ready to shift to Buy on stronger, multi-signal validation or to Sell if downside signals intensify and monetization milestones stall.
