Thanks for the push. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock data for TSLA on 2025-09-08, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError and didn’t retrieve any posts. I can retry, but it looks like there’s a backend issue with that data source right now.

Options to proceed:
1) Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately and continue once it succeeds.
2) Use a fallback approach: I’ll compile a comprehensive qualitative analysis using other available sources (public news, other social/media signals) for TSLA over the past week and clearly label any gaps due to missing Reddit data.
3) Wait for the Reddit tool to be fixed: I’ll resume with the full Reddit+news+sentiment analysis as soon as the tool is operational.

If you’d like me to proceed now with a fallback approach, here’s what I’ll deliver:
- A detailed sentiment overview for TSLA over the past 7 days, with day-by-day flavor (positive/negative/neutral) and the main drivers behind sentiment (e.g., product news, delivery figures, price changes, regulatory news, earnings chatter).
- A synthesis of recent company news related to TSLA (new product announcements, Factory/CapEx updates, regulatory or regulatory-advocacy items, China market developments, energy products, Autonomy/AI updates).
- Key social signals from major platforms (Reddit, X/Twitter, StockTwits, YouTube comment sentiment) summarized qualitatively with illustrative quotes or themes where possible.
- Trader-oriented implications: potential catalysts, risk factors, and sentiment-led risk-reward framing for TSLA—what kinds of news tend to move sentiment this week and how that could translate into price action.
- A concise, practitioner-focused set of takeaways for traders and portfolio managers.
- A MakrMarkdown table at the end to organize the key points (structure below).

Draft structure you’ll get (once data is in):
- Executive snapshot (one-liner on current sentiment and notable themes)
- Daily sentiment deep-dive (Date | Platform | Sentiment | Key themes)
- News pulse (Headline bullets with date)
- Social signal themes (Top 5 themes with representative quotes)
- Sentiment vs. price proxy notes (if price data is considered)
- Trader implications and risk factors
- Summary recommendations
- Markdown table (Key points by category)

If you want, I can proceed with option 2 right away (fallback approach) and deliver a thorough qualitative report now, clearly noting data gaps from Reddit. Otherwise, I can retry the Reddit data fetch first and then run the full analysis once that tool returns data.

Please choose:
- Retry Reddit data fetch now (yes/no)
- If no, proceed with fallback qualitative analysis (yes/no)

Final note: Once I have the data, I’ll append a Makrdown table with the key points at the end of the report, as requested.
