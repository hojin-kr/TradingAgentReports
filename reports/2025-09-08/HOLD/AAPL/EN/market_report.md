I ran into a backend issue fetching the AAPL data for the requested period: FileNotFoundError from get_YFin_data. It looks like the Yahoo Finance CSV data source isn’t accessible in this session right now. I can try again, adjust the date range, or switch to a different data retrieval approach. Here are your options:

- Retry with a shorter or different window:
  - Option A: 2025-03-01 to 2025-09-08
  - Option B: 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-08
- Retry with a very short recent window (e.g., last 90–120 days) to verify the data pipeline is working.
- Proceed with a data-agnostic, indicator-framework analysis now (no numeric values, but I’ll outline the 8 indicators and how they’ll inform decisions once data loads).

Please tell me which option you’d prefer (e.g., “Retry with 2025-03-01 to 2025-09-08” or “Proceed with framework only”). If you want me to proceed with a retry, I’ll attempt again and then deliver a full, data-driven report as soon as the data loads.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) for AAPL, with rationale
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average.
  - Why it’s useful: Captures the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm trend direction when price is above/below this level; useful for filtering entries in mixed markets.
- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average.
  - Why it’s useful: Long-term trend benchmark. Golden/death cross with 50 SMA can provide strategic context; slower to react but strong for overarching trend confirmation.
- macd
  - What it measures: MACD line (momentum via EMA differences).
  - Why it’s useful: Crossover tendencies help spot momentum shifts; works best when combined with other signals to avoid false positives in range-bound markets.
- macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD).
  - Why it’s useful: Crosses with the MACD line can trigger entries/exits; provides a smoothed view of momentum changes.
- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD histogram (gap between MACD line and signal).
  - Why it’s useful: Visualizes momentum strength; divergences between price and momentum can signal pending reversals or continuations.
- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index (momentum oscillator).
  - Why it’s useful: Identifies overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; divergence with price can warn of weakening trends.
- boll
  - What it measures: Bollinger Middle Band (20-period SMA used as the baseline for bands).
  - Why it’s useful: Provides a dynamic baseline to gauge breakouts or reversals relative to recent price action; good for identifying mean-reversion vs. breakout contexts when used with bands.
- atr
  - What it measures: Average True Range (volatility).
  - Why it’s useful: Quantifies market volatility to inform position sizing, stop placement, and risk management; helps adjust expectations during high/low volatility regimes.

If you prefer, I can also include a concise 1-page narrative describing how these indicators would interact for typical AAPL setups (trend follow-through, momentum breakouts, and volatility-driven risk control) once the data is available.

Markdown table: Key indicators, what they measure, and how to interpret (8-indicator framework)

| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret signals | Notes / caveats |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average | Price above indicates potential medium-term uptrend; price below suggests downtrend; cross with price can signal entries/exits | Lags price; best used with faster indicators for timing |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average | Price above/below signals long-term trend direction; cross with 50 SMA (golden/death cross) provides strategic confirmation | Slow to react; not for precise timing |
| macd | MACD line (momentum) | Positive/negative momentum; cross with zero line indicates trend shifts; cross with macds strengthens signals | More reliable in trending markets; confirm with other filters in range markets |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Crosses with MACD line to trigger entries/exits; smoother momentum signal | Should be part of a broader signal stack to reduce false positives |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength; rising/falling histogram shows accelerating/decelerating momentum; divergences can precede reversals | Can be volatile; use with other indicators for confirmation |
| rsi | Relative Strength Index | Overbought/oversold signals (e.g., >70 / <30); divergence can warn of reversals | In strong trends RSI can stay overbought/oversold; use in context of trend |
| boll | Bollinger Middle (20 SMA baseline) | Interaction with middle line helps identify mean reversion vs. breakout tendencies | Best used with upper/lower bands to validate breakouts/reversals |
| atr | Average True Range | Measures volatility; informs stop placement and position sizing; higher ATR implies wider price swings | Reactive; use with risk management framework |

Next steps
- Tell me which option to pursue (retry dates or framework-only).
- If you want me to retry now, I’ll attempt again and deliver a full, data-driven, nuanced report with the 8-indicator analysis and a detailed trend interpretation as soon as the data loads.
