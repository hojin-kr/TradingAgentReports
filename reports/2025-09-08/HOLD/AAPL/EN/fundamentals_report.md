 Apologies—the data fetch attempts hit a tool/environment error (FileNotFoundError) and I couldn’t retrieve the insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financial statements for AAPL as of 2025-09-08. I can retry the data pulls right away, or proceed with a qualitative, framework-based analysis while we resolve the tool issue. Please let me know which you prefer. In the meantime, here is a structured, ready-to-fill fundamental analysis draft you can use once the data are available.

Executive summary (data pending)
