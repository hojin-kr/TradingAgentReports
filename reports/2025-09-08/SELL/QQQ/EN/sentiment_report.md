I tried to fetch the Reddit sentiment data for QQQ across the requested dates, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry shortly or proceed with a robust framework using the data once it’s available. In the meantime, here is a thorough plan and a qualitative, data-agnostic approach you can use while we wait for the Reddit data to come back.

What happened
- Current issue: Reddit sentiment data retrieval failed (FileNotFoundError). This means I don’t have day-by-day social sentiment from Reddit for 2025-09-02 through 2025-09-08 to base a live-trend analysis on.

Next steps (pick one)
- Retry now: I can attempt the data fetch again immediately and then produce the full long report with day-by-day sentiment, top topics, and news integration.
- Proceed with a framework: I’ll deliver a detailed, trader-focused report using a robust analytical framework and placeholders for Reddit data. When the data returns, I’ll fill in the numbers and update the report.

What I can deliver right now (framework and qualitative analysis)
Note: This section outlines how we’ll analyze and interpret the data once the Reddit tool is functioning, plus the trader-oriented implications. It does not rely on the missing data.

1) Methodology we will apply to the Reddit data (when available)
- Daily sentiment score: positive/negative/neutral polarity per day, plus a net sentiment score (positives minus negatives).
- Volume and intensity: counts of posts/comments and an intensity metric (e.g., weighted by engagement).
- Top topics and themes: AI, mega-cap tech earnings, valuation, rate expectations, ETF flows, regulatory comments, geopolitical risk.
- Key posters and signal strength: identify whether sentiment is driven by influential, credible voices vs. noise (e.g., retail chatter vs. professional traders).
- Correlation with price: compare daily sentiment with intraday and close price movement, tracking lag effects (same-day vs. next-day correlations).

2) What the “QQQ” sentiment is likely reflecting (in a trader context)
- Concentration risk: QQQ is tech-heavy. Sentiment often tracks broad tech monthly/quarterly earnings expectations and macro rate expectations.
- Earnings cadence: periods around FQ results for big Nasdaq-100 constituents typically drive sentiment swings; positive earnings surprises or guidance can produce bullish sentiment chatter, while misses or cautious guidance can produce risk-off chatter.
- Macro-backdrop sensitivity: sentiment can swing with expectations for interest rate changes, inflation data, and liquidity conditions, even more so when tech stocks are dominant in the index.
- AI and innovation narrative: sentiment can spike on AI-driven demand themes or product announcements, even if price action is tempered by macro conditions.

3) Potential signals and trading implications (once we have data)
- Upbeat sentiment with rising volume but muted price: suggests potential upside continuation if macro environment remains supportive; look for a breakout in price or a re-rate in valuation.
- Negative sentiment spike on a strength in rate hikes or macro concerns: could precede short-term pullbacks; use price structure (support levels, trendlines) to gauge entry points for hedged or defensive plays.
- Divergences: if sentiment improves but price stalls or falls, this could indicate a diminishing conviction or a potential reversal risk—use this as a caution flag.
- Thematic clusters: sustained AI/tech optimism might drive sector rotation; monitor whether sentiment clusters around specific subthemes (e.g., cloud, semis, AI software) which could inform sector rotation ideas within or around QQQ.

4) Risk considerations for traders
- Event risk: earnings surprises (or guidance) from Nasdaq-100 constituents can cause rapid sentiment shifts that may not be immediately reflected in price.
- Macro surprises: unexpected changes in Fed messaging or inflation data can override social sentiment signals.
- Liquidity and flow risk: ETF flows can amplify moves in the short term, especially if there are hedging or passive flows.
- Sentiment data quality: social sentiment can be noisy; cross-check with other data sources (news sentiment, price action, and volume) for confirmation.

5) What the final report will include (when data is available)
- A day-by-day sentiment summary for 2025-09-02 through 2025-09-08 (or the available window).
- Top topics, notable posts or themes, and influential voices driving sentiment.
- Correlated price action: intraday moves, closes, and any gaps around sentiment shifts.
- News integration: key headlines or events in the week that likely influenced sentiment.
- Trader-oriented takeaways: actionable ideas with risk-adjusted framing (entry/exit ideas, hedges, and watchlists).
- A concluding assessment of the current state of QQQ sentiment vs. price, with implications for short-term (days to weeks) vs. longer-term positioning.

6) Makrdown table (ready to fill with data)
Here is a ready-to-fill table you can drop the data into once the Reddit feed returns. It’s organized for quick reading and decision support.

Request for next step
- Should I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then generate the full long-form report with day-by-day sentiment, topics, and news once the data comes back?
- Or would you prefer I proceed with a qualitative, framework-driven report now (as outlined above) and fill in the concrete numbers as soon as the Reddit data is available?

If you’d like, I can also proceed to draft the full long report structure with sections expanded and ready to populate, so you can drop in the data as soon as the tool works again.
