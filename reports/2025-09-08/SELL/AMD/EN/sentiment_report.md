Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for AMD across Sept 2–Sept 8, 2025, but the tool call(s) returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the Reddit sentiment data to build the full report right now.

What happened
- Parallel data fetch attempts for AMD on 2025-09-02 through 2025-09-08 all failed with FileNotFoundError from the Reddit stock info tool.
- A subsequent single-call attempt for 2025-09-08 also failed with the same error.
- This means I don’t currently have the daily Reddit sentiment data to analyze.

What I can do right now
- Retry data retrieval as soon as the tool is available again.
- If you’d like, proceed with a rigorous framework and a placeholder/synthetic dataset (clearly labeled as synthetic) so we can deliver a near-term, actionable analysis while we wait for real data.
- Alternatively, you can provide any offline sentiment data you have (CSV/JSON) or allow me to substitute with other sources (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, or mainstream news) if you’re okay with me using those in place of Reddit.

Recommended next steps
- Option 1: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and, if successful, produce a comprehensive AMD sentiment report covering Sept 2–Sept 8, 2025, with a day-by-day sentiment breakdown, top themes, notable posts, and a concluding risk/positioning assessment for traders.
- Option 2: You approve a synthetic-data version to see the structure and insights we’d produce, clearly labeled as synthetic, so you can review the methodology and formatting while the real data is being resolved.
- Option 3: You provide or authorize an alternative data source (e.g., Reddit + Twitter) to ensure we still deliver a robust sentiment-oriented report.

Proposed structure for the AMD sentiment report (to be filled when data is available)
- Executive snapshot
  - Key sentiment trend: overall tone, notable shifts, and potential catalysts.
  - Immediate read for traders: likely intraday moves, volatility expectations, and catalyst timeline.
- Daily sentiment breakdown (Sept 2–Sept 8)
  - For each day: sentiment score (e.g., net bullish vs. bearish), volume of posts, top themes, and standout posts.
  - Short interpretation: what the day’s sentiment could imply for price action.
- Thematic analysis
  - Product/architecture updates (e.g., RDNA4, Zen/MI, data center GPUs), AI acceleration chatter, supply chain rumors, demand signals.
  - Company actions: earnings guidance, roadmap hints, partnerships, AI/enterprise/TAM-related discussions.
- News snapshot (past week)
  - Any earnings calls, product launches, partnerships, regulatory updates, or leadership comments that influenced sentiment.
  - Compare sentiment reaction to the actual news (surprise vs. expected).
- Sentiment vs. fundamentals and price action
  - Correlations between sentiment spikes/dips and price/volume moves.
  - Any divergence (positive sentiment with price weakness or vice versa) and potential reasons.
- Risk factors and caveats
  - Sentiment noise, meme dynamics, hype cycles, cross-asset influences (semis sector moves, AI hype), and potential data biases.
- Trading implications and actionable ideas
  - Short-term catalysts to watch (e.g., upcoming product announcements, quarterly results, or major partnerships).
  - Possible risk-managed trades (e.g., options strategies around event risk, hedges, or range framework).
  - What to monitor in the next 1–2 weeks if sentiment remains supportive or turns sour.
- Methodology notes
  - Data sources, sentiment scoring approach, normalization, and any limitations.

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now, hoping the tool comes back online, or
- Proceed with a synthetic-data version to review the report structure and insights, or
- Use an alternative data source you specify?

If you prefer, I can start with Option 2 (synthetic data) and deliver a full, polished long-form AMD sentiment report today, clearly labeled as synthetic and with a comprehensive methodology. Then, as soon as the Reddit tool is available again, I’ll replace the synthetic data with the real data and update the report accordingly.
