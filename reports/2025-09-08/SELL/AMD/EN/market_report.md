I attempted to fetch AMD data and compute the requested indicators, but the data layer returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry in a moment, or proceed with a qualitative, rules-based analysis and a clear plan for when the data loads. Below is the chosen indicator set (8 indicators) and a detailed framework you can use with AMD once the data is available.

Selected indicators (8) with rationale
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Useful for mid-term trend direction and as dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm or question trend when aligned with other signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark and a common source for golden/death cross insights. Good for strategic trend confirmation.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. A responsive short-term momentum gauge to flag quick shifts and potential entries when used with longer-term averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum and trend-change signal via crossovers and divergence. Acts as a backbone for momentum interpretation, especially in conjunction with price position relative to moving averages.
- macds: MACD signal line. Crossovers with MACD line provide more robust entry/exit cues and help filter false signals.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions. Useful for spotting reversals or reinforcing trend signals when combined with price/MA context.
- boll: Bollinger middle (20-period SMA). Baseline for price volatility context; helps identify squeezes and potential breakout zones when used with bands.
- atr: ATR. Volatility measure used for risk management, stop placement, and position sizing. Critical to manage AMD’s often episodic volatility around earnings/events.

How I would interpret these for AMD (contextual guidance)
- Trend direction and confirmation
  - If price stays above both 50SMA and 200SMA, and the 50SMA remains above the 200SMA, the intermediate-to-long-term trend is constructive. A golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) would bolster a bullish stance; a death cross would argue for caution.
  - If price sits below both SMAs, or the 50SMA crosses below the 200SMA, treat as bearish trend indication unless there is a strong, immediate bullish catalyst supported by other signals.
- Short-term momentum signals
  - A bullish MACD setup (MACD line crossing above the MACD signal, ideally with a rising MACD histogram) can precede or confirm upside moves, particularly when price is near/above the 10 EMA and above the 50SMA.
  - A bearish MACD cross (MACD line crossing below MACD signal) can precede pullbacks, especially if RSI shows weakening momentum or if price fails to hold above the 10 EMA.
- Relative strength and momentum confirmation
  - RSI rising toward and staying above 50 (but below 70) supports ongoing upside momentum; RSI diverging upward in price is a bullish nuance, while RSI diverging downward as price makes new highs can warn of weakness.
  - If RSI nears overbought territory (above 70) while price remains extended above key moving averages, be wary of a potential pullback or consolidation unless supported by rising ATR and widening Bollinger bands.
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising indicates increasing volatility; use higher stop distances and/or adjusted position sizing to manage risk around earnings cycles or product-cycle events.
  - Bollinger middle (20SMA) alignment with price interacting with upper/lower bands can signal potential breakouts (price riding the upper band with MACD bullish) or reversals (price touching the upper band with fading MACD/momentum).
- Practical setups to watch (rules-based)
  - Bullish setup: price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD above signal with histogram turning positive, RSI > 50 but < 70, price testing or holding above the 10 EMA, and price trading near or above the Bollinger middle with evidence of a squeezing to expanding bands (lower implied volatility followed by breakout).
  - Bearish setup: price below 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD below signal with histogram negative, RSI weakening toward 30-40, price failing to hold above the 10 EMA, and price hugging or breaking lower Bollinger bands with rising ATR signaling active volatility.
- Risk-aware context for AMD
  - AMD often reacts to earnings, product announcements, and sector-wide AI demand dynamics. Use ATR to adjust stop losses and position sizes around official event dates. Confirm signals with cross-indicator agreement (e.g., MACD + RSI + price staying below/above key SMAs) to avoid reacting to one-off news noise.

Next steps (once data is available)
- I’ll compute the eight indicators precisely for AMD over the requested window (2024-01-01 to 2025-09-08) and deliver:
  - A nuanced narrative on trend, momentum, and volatility dynamics
  - Concrete, signal-based trading ideas (entries/exits/size) aligned with the rules above
  - A summarized, trader-friendly table of observations
- I will also provide a concise set of actionable thresholds (e.g., MACD cross timings, RSI zones, price vs. SMA relationships) tailored to AMD's current chart.

Note on status
- Data retrieval attempt status: failed due to a FileNotFoundError from the data layer. I can retry immediately or you can authorize me to retry after a short interval. If you’d prefer, I can proceed with the qualitative framework now and run the numeric analysis as soon as data loading is successful.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation guide
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AMD (context) | Practical usage notes |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Mid-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance | If price > 50SMA and 50SMA > 200SMA: bullish medium-term; cross above 200SMA is a stronger bullish signal. | Use with close_200_sma for trend confirmation; watch for golden/death crosses. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA suggests long-term uptrend; price below indicates long-term risk; cross of 50SMA over/under 200SMA adds clarity. | Core for strategic bias; avoid over-trading in purely noise-driven moves. |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum gauge | Price above 10EMA supports momentum; a cross of price or MA momentum with 10EMA can preface quick entries. | Best used with longer MA filters to reduce noise. |
| macd | Momentum and trend-change signal | MACD line crossing above MACD signal indicates bullish momentum; cross below signals bearish momentum. | Confirm with RSI and price position relative to SMAs to reduce false positives. |
| macds | MACD signal line cross | MACD signal cross provides an additional confirmation layer for MACD-based entries/exits. | Use in conjunction with MACD line and histogram for robustness. |
| rsi | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions | RSI rising toward 50-70 supports up-move; divergence or sustained >70 can warn of exhaustion. | Use with trend context; avoid relying on RSI in strongly trending markets where it can stay overbought. |
| boll | Bollinger middle (20SMA) context | Price interaction with middle band signals baseline momentum; breakouts often accompany band expansion. | Watch for squeezes (low volatility) followed by breakout; confirm with MACD. |
| atr | Volatility and risk management | Rising ATR signals higher volatility (earnings/events); adjust stops and sizing accordingly. | Use for dynamic stop distances and risk controls around key catalysts. |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and proceed with a full, numbers-backed AMD report as soon as the data is available. Would you like me to retry immediately, or would you prefer I proceed with the qualitative framework and revisit numeric specifics once the data loads?
