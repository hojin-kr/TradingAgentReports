Recommendation: SELL

Rationale (concise):
- Near-term risk-reward is skewed to the downside despite a long-term AI/data-center narrative. AI order cadence for AMD remains volatile, ramp costs and margins face execution risk, and Nvidia's entrenched ecosystem adds competitive headwinds.
- Valuation is sensitive to AI demand pacing and margin progression. Any slowdown in orders, weaker-than-expected ramp yields, or macro/regulatory headwinds could trigger a multiple contraction faster than upside materializes.
- Macro noise and policy considerations heighten the risk of demand pauses, making a disciplined risk stance appropriate rather than a high-conviction long exposure.

Practical actions if you already hold AMD:
- Trim exposure: Reduce AMD by 30–50% to de-risk portfolio concentration and preserve capital for hedges or other opportunities.
- Hedge residual exposure:
  - Buy long-dated puts (6–9 months) slightly OTM (e.g., 5–15% OTM) to establish a floor against material downside without overpaying for protection.
  - Or implement a collar: long puts (protective) funded by selling calls at a higher strike; caps upside but lowers cost and provides downside protection.
- Stop-loss and risk controls:
  - Establish a trailing stop or a hard stop if AMD breaks below critical trend lines (e.g., a breach of key moving averages) or if AI-order cadence disappoints for two consecutive quarters.
  - Limit risk per single name to a defined cap (e.g., no more than 1–2% of portfolio risk after trims).

Considerations for new exposure or rebalancing:
- If seeking AI/data-center exposure, favor hedged strategies or diversified, lower-idiosyncratic risk positions rather than a large unhedged single-name bet.
- Only re-enter with conviction if there are observable multi-quarter credible AI-order wins, demonstrable margin stabilization, and clear milestone progress on Zen 6/2nm/3nm ramps. Until then, avoid meaningful new long exposure.

What to monitor going forward:
- AI-order cadence signals (MI/EPYC wins, data-center deployments), Zen 6/2nm/3nm ramp milestones and yields, Arizona fab ramp progress, macro/regulatory developments, and earnings commentary on AI compute spend.

Learning note:
- No past memories to draw from. This plan emphasizes disciplined risk controls, hedging, and waiting for clearer multi-quarter catalysts before increasing long exposure.
