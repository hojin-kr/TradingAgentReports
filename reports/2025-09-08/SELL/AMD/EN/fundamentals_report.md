I attempted to fetch the latest AMD data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financials via SimFin) for 2025-09-08, but the data layer returned FileNotFoundError across all requested endpoints. The data backend seems unavailable right now.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry data retrieval now: I can reissue the tool calls immediately and report back with the latest figures if the backend comes back online.
- Proceed with a qualitative, up-to-date-agnostic AMD fundamentals overview: I’ll summarize AMD’s business model, competitive position, and typical financial characteristics, clearly labeling any data gaps and caveats about timeliness.
- Use alternative data you provide: If you have recent AMD filings or numbers (e.g., from AMD press releases or a file you can share), I can integrate them into a comprehensive report.
- A mix approach: I can start with a qualitative framework now and attempt to fetch data again in parallel, reporting any partial data I can retrieve.

What would you prefer? In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the final comprehensive report once data is available, including a Markdown table at the end to organize key points:

Proposed report structure (to be populated with the data once retrieved)
- Company profile: business model, segments (CPU, GPUs, semi-custom), end markets, key customers, geographic footprint.
- Recent company highlights: major product launches, strategic initiatives (e.g., data center growth, AI/machine learning acceleration, supply chain actions).
- Basic financials (latest quarter and trailing twelve months where available): revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EBITDA, margins, tax rate.
- Balance sheet highlights: assets, liabilities, equity, working capital, liquidity metrics (current ratio, quick ratio).
- Cash flow highlights: operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow, financing activities.
- Profitability and efficiency trends: gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROIC, ROA, asset turnover.
- Leverage and liquidity: debt levels, debt-to-equity, interest coverage, cash on hand.
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 30 days): directional tone, notable insiders buying or selling, potential implications.
- Competitive landscape and risk factors: peer comparison (NVIDIA, Intel, others), supply chain risks, geopolitical/regulatory considerations, AI semiconductor demand cycles.
- Catalysts and scenarios: demand cycles (gaming vs. data center), AI compute demand, product roadmaps, potential margin expansion or compression.
- Trader-oriented takeaways: what the data implies for revenue visibility, margin resilience, and capital allocation signals.

If you want me to proceed with retrying data retrieval now, just say "retry," and I’ll reissue the data calls as soon as you’re ready.
