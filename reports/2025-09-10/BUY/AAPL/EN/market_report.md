I attempted to fetch AAPL data and run the requested indicators, but I hit a FileNotFoundError from the data tools. I can retry now or after a moment, but in the meantime here’s a detailed plan and a thoughtful selection of indicators you can use for AAPL given the current market context. Once I can fetch the data, I’ll provide a full, data-driven readout with concrete signals.

Best-practice indicator set (up to 8, diverse and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - What it provides: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level.
  - Why useful here: Helps confirm the prevailing trend when used with faster signals.
- close_200_sma
  - What it provides: Long-term trend anchor; useful for confirming broader regime (bullish/bearish).
  - Why useful here: Golden cross/death cross context and macro-trend confirmation.
- close_10_ema
  - What it provides: Short-term momentum with quicker reaction to price shifts.
  - Why useful here: Captures quick entry/exit hints; good for timing around the longer-term trend.
- macd
  - What it provides: Momentum via differences of EMAs; crossovers indicate potential trend changes.
  - Why useful here: Complements price trends with momentum shifts; signals are more robust when aligned with price action.
- macds
  - What it provides: MACD signal line (the EMA of MACD).
  - Why useful here: Crossovers with MACD line to trigger trades; helps filter false positives when used with other signals.
- rsi
  - What it provides: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why useful here: Helps spot potential reversals/divergences, especially in the context of a broader trend confirmed by price and MACD.
- atr
  - What it provides: Market volatility level; true range-based measure.
  - Why useful here: Helps set risk management thresholds (stops/position sizing) and adapt to changing volatility environments.
- vwma
  - What it provides: Volume-weighted moving average; price action filtered by volume.
  - Why useful here: Confirms trend with volume, highlighting conviction behind moves and helping to filter out low-volume noise.

Notes on interpretation approach (once data is available)
- Alignment is key: If price sits above 50_sma and 200_sma, and MACD shows positive momentum while RSI sits in a healthy range (not extreme), the set-up leans bullish. If VWMA confirms with rising volume on up days, that reinforces the move.
- Watch for crossovers: A price cross above the 10_ema can signal short-term acceleration, but validation from MACD and VWMA should reduce false signals in choppy markets.
- Volatility context: ATR rising suggests higher risk per move; consider wider stops or reduced position size. ATR falling in a rising price context could indicate a pause or consolidation.
- Overbought/oversold nuance: RSI moving into overbought territory in a strong uptrend is common, but should be corroborated by MACD momentum and price staying above long-term moving averages to avoid premature exits.
- Volume context: A breakout that occurs with rising VWMA support and above the 50_sma/200_sma tends to be more durable than a move on light volume.

What I need from you
- Do you want me to retry fetching the data and run the indicators now? I can re-run with the same window (2023-09-01 to 2025-09-10) or adjust the date range.
- If you have a preferred window (e.g., last 90 days, last 2 years) or a specific trading horizon (intraday, swing, or investment), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis.

Appendix: quick reference table (to be filled with actual values once data loads)
Indicator | What it measures | How to use
- close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average | Long-term trend confirmation
- close_10_ema | 10-period exponential moving average | Short-term momentum and entry timing
- macd | MACD line (momentum) | Trend change signals; crossovers with MACD Signal
- macds | MACD Signal line | Trade trigger when crossing MACD line
- rsi | Relative strength momentum | Overbought/oversold context; divergence signals
- atr | Average true range | Volatility for risk management and stops
- vwma | Volume-weighted moving average | Trend confirmation with volume

If you’d like, I can proceed to retry now and then provide a full, data-backed narrative with actual values and a detailed, actionable interpretation. Just say “retry” and I’ll run the data fetch and indicator extraction again.
