I ran into a tool error fetching Reddit stock news for AAPL on 2025-09-10 (FileNotFoundError). I can’t retrieve the Reddit data right now, which is a key input for the full analysis you asked for.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again immediately.
- Proceed with a structured plan: I’ll draft the full long-form report framework (sentiment, news, implications, trader-focused insights) and fill in once the Reddit data is available.
- Use an alternative approach: If you have other data sources you want me to analyze (e.g., a dataset you provide, or public news articles you want me to include), I can start with those right away and add Reddit data when the tool becomes available.

If you prefer, I can proceed with a detailed outline of the report and the exact sections I will fill in once the Reddit data is retrieved. Here’s the plan I’ll follow for the final report (to be appended with a Makrdown table of key points at the end):

Proposed report structure (to be completed after data retrieval)
- Executive snapshot
  - One-paragraph summary of current sentiment, key risk/reward signals, and immediate catalysts.
- Data sources and methodology
  - Reddit posts (past 7 days and daily sentiment on the current date)
  - Public company news (last 7-10 days)
  - Any auxiliary sentiment signals (if available)
- Daily sentiment trend (past 7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment scores (bullish, bearish, neutral)
  - Notable volume spikes or post topics by day
- Top themes and drivers from Reddit
  - Bullish themes (e.g., product pipeline, services growth, financials)
  - Bearish themes (e.g., supply chain, competition, regulatory risk)
  - Mixed/neutral themes (e.g., valuation questions, macro concerns)
- Key company news (last 7-10 days)
  - Earnings hints, product announcements, regulatory updates, partnerships, supply chain news
  - Any notable guidance or management commentary
- Sentiment vs. fundamentals context
  - How current sentiment aligns or diverges from recent earnings, guidance, product cycles
  - Seasonal/quarterly factors (e.g., product refresh cycles, iPhone cycle timing)
- Trader-oriented implications
  - Short-term risk signals (volatility windows, sentiment reversals)
  - Medium-term considerations (catalysts, downside/upside risk scenarios)
  - Positioning guidance (if sentiment is skewed, what that implies for setups)
- Risks and caveats
  - Data limitations, potential biases in social media, event-driven uncertainty
- Makrdown key-points table
  - A concise, easy-to-scan table summarizing the main takeaways, catalysts, and risk signals

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data pull now, or
- Should I proceed with the outlined plan (and I’ll fill in the details as soon as the Reddit data becomes available), or
- Do you want to provide an alternate data source to start with?
