I ran into a tool error trying to fetch Reddit stock data for NVDA (FileNotFoundError). I can’t pull the Reddit sentiment data at the moment. If you’d like, I can either retry later or proceed with a structured NVDA sentiment/news report using other sources you’re comfortable with. Below is a plan and a placeholder table you can fill in once the Reddit data tool is available, or I can adapt to other data sources you authorize.

What I can do next (two options)
- Option A: Retry Reddit data fetch now or on your signal, and then deliver the full long-form report with day-by-day sentiment and news.
- Option B: Proceed with a comprehensive NVDA sentiment/news report using non-Reddit sources (e.g., official company news, press releases, major financial news outlets) and clearly labeled sentiment signals, with a robust trader-oriented analysis.

Proposed structure for the NVDA sentiment/news long report
- Executive snapshot
  - Quick read: current sentiment tone (overall positive/neutral/negative), key catalysts, and potential near-term risks.
- Daily sentiment heatmap (past week)
  - Day-by-day sentiment polarity and intensity
  - Notable themes driving sentiment each day
- Thematic analysis
  - AI/machine learning demand dynamics, data-center demand, supply chain constraints, product roadmap insights, competitive landscape
- News & events in the past week
  - Summary of earnings notes, product announcements, partnerships, regulatory/regulatory comments, and macro drivers
- Public sentiment drivers and risk implications
  - What’s driving mood (bullish vs bearish), potential reversals, and catalysts that could shift sentiment
- Trader-oriented implications
  - Short-term trading signals (hypothetical scenarios), risk management considerations, and potential entry/exit considerations around catalysts
- Summary of key takeaways
  - Concise bullets for quick decision-making
- Markdown table (at end)
  - A compact reference of daily sentiment and notable themes

Markdown table skeleton (end of report)
- Purpose: organize key points in a compact, readable way for quick scanning
- Note: populate with the data once Reddit data is available (or with any substitute data you approve)

| Date       | Source/Platform | Sentiment | Net Sentiment Change vs prior day | Top Topics/Themes | Notable News/Events | Estimated Impact on NVDA | Catalyst/Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------|

Example (placeholders)
| 2025-09-04 | Reddit (NVDA)    | Mixed/Neutral | 0 | AI chip demand, supply chain chatter | None major | Medium | Watch for on-cycle catalysts |
| 2025-09-05 | Reddit (NVDA)    | Positive | +1 | Data-center capex, GPU pricing | Earnings commentary snippets | High | Potential upside if data-center demand holds |
| 2025-09-06 | Reddit (NVDA)    | Negative | -1 | Competition, valuation concerns | Market-wide tech pullback | Medium | Monitor macro tone and earnings guidance |

Next steps
- Tell me which option you prefer:
  - Retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
  - Proceed with Option B (non-Reddit sources) and I’ll deliver the full NVDA sentiment/news report with the skeleton table filled in to the extent possible from those sources
- If you have alternative data sources you want included (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, YouTube earnings commentary, Bloomberg/Reuters feed), share them and I’ll incorporate them.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data tool now, or start with the non-Reddit sentiment/news report and fill in the table once Reddit data becomes available?
