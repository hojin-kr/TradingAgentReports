I attempted to fetch AMD data and compute the requested indicators, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the actual current/historical values to describe precise trends right now. Here’s how I propose to proceed and a robust, complementary indicator set you can use once the data load succeeds. I’ll also explain how these indicators would provide insight for AMD in typical market conditions.

What happened
- Data fetch attempt failed due to an environment/file issue (FileNotFoundError). I can retry if you’d like me to/run in a fresh session, or you can re-run when the data service is available.
- In the meantime, I’ve prepared a focused, non-redundant set of indicators (up to 8) that will give you a well-rounded view of trend, momentum, volatility, and volume dynamics for AMD.

 Recommended indicators (up to 8, chosen for complementarity and coverage)
1) close_200_sma (Long-term trend benchmark)
- What it gives you: Aids in assessing the overarching market regime (bullish vs bearish) and acts as a dynamic support/resistance level.
- Why it’s important for AMD: AMD’s longer-term cycles (product cycles, AI demand tailwinds/headwinds) often align with the 200SMA. Confirming the long-term trend helps avoid counter-trend entries.

2) close_50_sma (Medium-term trend)
- What it gives you: Mid-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance zone.
- Why it’s important for AMD: Helps validate the primary trend direction alongside the 200SMA; crossovers with 200SMA (golden/death cross) can indicate meaningful regime shifts.

3) close_10_ema (Short-term momentum)
- What it gives you: Quick reaction to shifts in price momentum; more sensitive than SMAs.
- Why it’s important for AMD: In a stock influenced by AI cycles, hardware demand news, and semis sentiment, short-term momentum signals can help with timely entries/exits, provided you filter with longer-term trends.

4) macd (MACD line)
- What it gives you: Momentum direction and trend change signals via the MACD line crossing zero and crossing with the signal line.
- Why it’s important for AMD: Helps detect shifts in the momentum of price moves, useful when price is moving with or against the broader tech/semiconductor sector sentiment.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- What it gives you: Smoother confirmation of MACD-driven signals; crossovers with the MACD line provide signals with reduced noise.
- Why it’s important for AMD: Adds confirmation to momentum-based entries/exits and reduces false signals in choppy markets.

6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
- What it gives you: Visual representation of momentum strength and divergence, quick-read on momentum acceleration/deceleration.
- Why it’s important for AMD: Divergence between price and MACD histogram can foreshadow reversals or trend stalls, which is valuable around earnings or supply-demand inflection points.

7) rsi (Relative Strength Index)
- What it gives you: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold signals and potential divergence clues.
- Why it’s important for AMD: Helps identify potential reversals after strong moves, but should be used with trend context (e.g., price above 200SMA or 50SMA for uptrends).

8) atr (Average True Range)
- What it gives you: Quantifies volatility, useful for sizing and stop placement.
- Why it’s important for AMD: Volatility tends to spike around earnings, product launches, or macro news. ATR-based stop loss and position sizing help manage risk during these periods.

What to look for once data is available (practical reading steps)
- Trend alignment: Check if price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA; if not, treat long entries with extra caution or focus on mean-reversion setups.
- Short vs long-term momentum: Compare direction of close_10_ema with MACD (and MACD histogram). Converging signals (e.g., price above EMAs, MACD rising, MACD histogram positive) strengthen bullish bias.
- Momentum confirmation: Use RSI alongside MACD to avoid overreliance on a single signal. An RSI in the 60–75 range with rising MACD helps support continued upside; RSI near overbought thresholds with bearish MACD divergence warns of a potential pullback.
- Volatility context: Use ATR to gauge stop distance and risk. A rising ATR with strong price movement signals a robust move but wider stops; a shrinking ATR may indicate consolidation and lower breakout risk.
- Reversal/divergence clues: Watch MACD histogram changes and RSI divergences against price highs/lows to anticipate potential reversals, especially around earnings or product-cycle announcements.

Next steps
- I can retry the data retrieval now (or in a fresh session) to produce a live, data-backed report with the exact values for AMD as of 2025-09-10 and the 365-day lookback you requested.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with the 8 indicators listed above and provide a precise trend analysis once the data is available, including a structured, point-by-point read of each indicator’s current signal and cross-confirmations.

Appendix: Key indicators table (conceptual, once data is loaded)
| Indicator | Category | What to look for | How it helps AMD decisions | Potential signals to watch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Price position vs 200SMA; golden/death cross with 50SMA | Confirms long-term regime; filters noise | Price above 200SMA with rising trend = bullish; cross below = caution |
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Price position vs 50SMA; cross with 200SMA | Medium-term trend alignment; support/resistance | 50SMA above 200SMA and price above = bullish bias |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term price momentum relative to trend | Early signals of momentum shifts; quick entries | Price above 10EMA with rising slope = bullish momentum |
| macd | MACD line | MACD line direction vs zero; cross with MACD sign | Core momentum signal for trend changes | MACD line crosses above zero or above MACD signal = bullish |
| macds | MACD Signal | MACD signal line interactions | Smoother confirmation; reduces false positives | MACD line crossing MACD signal from below → buy, from above → sell |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence | Early warning of strength changes | Histogram rising positive indicates strengthening up move; negative divergence with price = caution |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold levels | Reversal/continuation clues; divergence signals | RSI rising through 50–70 with price strength = bullish; divergence = watch for pullback |
| atr | Volatility | True range average; volatility level | Risk management; stop sizing; position adjustments | Rising ATR = higher volatility and wider stops; falling ATR = potential consolidation |

If you’d like, I can retry pulling the data now and then deliver a fully data-driven AMD report with precise current values, indicator states, and a final actionable takeaway. Please tell me whether you want me to retry in this session or in a new one.
