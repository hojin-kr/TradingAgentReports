Decision: Buy (with disciplined risk controls and staged exposure)

Rationale (why this decision fits the plan and current context)
- AMD’s multi-rail growth thesis remains intact: data-center AI compute (MI accelerators + EPYC) with ROCm tooling, plus gaming/creator upside (RDNA, FSR 4), and a broad platform ecosystem that cross-sells CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators. This diversification reduces reliance on a single AI spike and supports more resilient revenue trajectories.
- Competitive moat is expanding: chiplet-based packaging on TSMC nodes can preserve cost-per-performance advantages, while ROCm and open tooling deepen enterprise traction and reduce developer switching costs.
- Structural tailwinds support durable demand: AI/HPC infrastructure investment by cloud providers and enterprises remains a meaningful driver beyond any one AI spike.
- Capital discipline adds optionality: AMD’s ability to balance R&D with cash flow supports potential buybacks and strategic flexibility, which can help margin trajectory if data-center mix improves.
- Bear risks acknowledged and mitigated by breadth: although Nvidia’s dominance is meaningful, AMD’s multi-architecture stack and ecosystem create a credible deployment path across multiple vendors and workloads. Risks around AI demand durability, node/chiplet execution, and margins exist but are mitigated by diversification and governance.

Caveats and risk controls
- The bear case remains valid: AI demand could be cyclical and Nvidia-led software/installed-base advantage is a hurdle. Execution risk on next-gen nodes and ROCm maturity could pressure margins or timing.
- Given volatility and sensitivity to data-center bookings, implement strict risk controls (see entry plan below) and monitor backlog, ASPs, and ROCm/MD tooling adoption as primary catalysts.

Strategic actions (concrete steps to implement the Buy thesis)
1) Positioning and sizing
- Initiate with staged exposure: 40–60% of your intended AMD allocation now, with a plan to deploy the remainder on clear catalysts (backlog growth, MI/EPYC bookings, ROCm traction) or on a pullback to support levels.
- Size by risk budget; ensure overall portfolio exposure aligns with your volatility tolerance and liquidity needs.

2) Entry triggers and risk controls
- Entry points: current price if not excessively extended, or on a modest pullback to a defined technical support confluence (e.g., near 50- or 200-day moving average convergence, or a 5–8% drawdown).
- Stops: place a protective stop at a multiple of ATR below entry (e.g., 1.5–2x ATR) to guard against outsized intraday swings.
- Hedging: consider a protective put or a collar around major catalysts (earnings, AI roadmap milestones) to preserve upside while limiting downside.

3) Catalysts and data-driven updates
- Data-center signals: EPYC bookings, MI backlog momentum, ROCm adoption metrics (developers, enterprise deployments), and ASP/backlog changes.
- Roadmap milestones: cadence of MI cycles, RDNA4/FSR 4 uptake, Zen/architecture progress, and ecosystem partnerships.
- Financial health: gross margin trajectory and data-center mix evolution; monitor for signs of sustained margin lift.

4) Cadence of reviews and scenario planning
- Run quarterly reviews with bull/base/bear scenarios, updating weights as new data arrives. Escalate conviction on stronger backlog growth, margin improvement, or ROCm traction; trim or pause exposure if AI backlog stalls or margins deteriorate.
- Use data-driven triggers to add or reduce exposure rather than purely sentiment-driven moves.

5) Risk management and learning from past missteps
- Maintain guardrails to distinguish hype from fundamentals. Require multi-signal confirmation (backlog, margins, ROCm momentum) before increasing exposure.
- After catalysts, perform a quick post-mortem: which data moved the thesis, how did the stock react, and what would you adjust next time?

6) Exit plan (predefined if thesis fails or risk controls trigger)
- Predefine trims or exits if AI backlog/backlog-to-revenue ratio deteriorates, margins stall, or major catalysts disappoint.
- If Nvidia-led risk dominates and AMD cannot demonstrate credible, durable AI/compute wins, reassess the position and reduce exposure.

Closing note
- If you’d prefer a data-driven, numbers-first AMD brief, I can switch to live-keyed signals, targets, and stop levels as soon as a live data feed is available in this session. For now, the plan supports a Buy with staged entry and robust risk controls, balancing AI-centric catalysts with AMD’s broader growth engines.
