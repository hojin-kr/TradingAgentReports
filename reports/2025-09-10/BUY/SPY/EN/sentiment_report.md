Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment/news for SPY for 2025-09-10, but the tool returned a backend error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This suggests the data source or its backing file isn’t accessible at the moment.

What I can do next (your call):
- Retry now: I can re-run the Reddit data fetch in this same session and proceed once it succeeds.
- Proceed without Reddit data: I can deliver a thorough qualitative analysis based on general market context, macro news, and typical sentiment patterns for SPY, clearly noting the data source gap.
- Wait and retry later: I can queue a retry and start with a forward-looking analysis in the meantime, then integrate Reddit sentiment as soon as the tool is available.

If you’d like, I can start with Option 2 (no Reddit data) and provide a comprehensive long-form report with:
- Daily sentiment themes (general market sentiment around SPY, e.g., risk-on vs risk-off drivers)
- Macro/news backdrop (inflation, rates, GDP, earnings season, geopolitical news)
- Flow and positioning signals (ETF flows, options activity patterns, if available from public signals)
- Key risks and catalysts for the next 1–2 weeks
- Trader-oriented implications (entries/exits, risk management, hedging ideas)

Additionally, I’ll append a Markdown table at the end to organize key points clearly, as requested.

Please let me know which option you prefer:
1) Retry Reddit data now
2) Proceed without Reddit data (provide a detailed qualitative report)
3) Schedule a retry for a specific time and proceed with a provisional qualitative report in the meantime

If you want me to proceed right away with a qualitative report, I’ll start assembling the analysis and deliver the long-form report with the table at the end.
