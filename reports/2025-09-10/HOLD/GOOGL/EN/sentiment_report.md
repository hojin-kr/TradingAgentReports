I’m seeing a tool error on the Reddit stock info fetch for GOOGL today:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

I’ll propose a few ways to move forward so we don’t lose momentum:

Option A — Retry the Reddit tool now
- I’ll retry fetching Reddit-based sentiment/news for GOOGL for 2025-09-10 and continue with the full long-form report once I get the data.

Option B — Use alternative sources for the week
- I can compile a comprehensive sentiment and news report using available public sources beyond Reddit (e.g., major news outlets, stock sentiment communities, X/Twitter, StockTwits, Google-aligned press coverage, etc.) and provide a detailed, trader-focused analysis for the past week.

Option C — Narrow the scope to qualitative analysis
- If you’d prefer, I can produce a thorough qualitative analysis of Alphabet/GOOGL’s recent themes (AI, cloud, ads market, regulatory considerations, product updates) with inferred sentiment trends and potential catalysts, even if I can’t pull Reddit data in real-time right this moment.

What I can deliver in the long report (regardless of data source choice)
- A day-by-day sentiment snapshot for the past week (positive/negative/neutral) with notable spikes tied to specific events.
- A synthesis of recent company news relevant to price action (earnings cadence, product launches, regulatory/regulatory-improvement headlines, cloud/AI updates, antitrust noise, leadership signals).
- Key drivers and potential catalysts over the near term (next 1–2 weeks and next 1–3 months).
- Risk flags and sentiment-versus-price mispricings to watch for traders.
- A summarized Makrdown table at the end organizing key points, themes, catalysts, and sentiment signals.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry the Reddit data now (Option A)
- Proceed with an alternative-data approach (Option B)
- Proceed with a qualitative, non-Reddit-focused analysis (Option C)

If you have a preference for the date window (e.g., the past 5–7 days specifically vs. the calendar week), or want me to focus on specific subtopics (AI, ads business, YouTube, cloud, regulatory), let me know and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.
