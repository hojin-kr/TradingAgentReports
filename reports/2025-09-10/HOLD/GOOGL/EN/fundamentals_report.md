I attempted to fetch GOOGL insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financial statements, but the data layer returned a FileNotFoundError (environment issue with the data tools). I can retry, but I want to confirm how you’d like to proceed.

Options:
1) Retry the data retrieval now (I’ll attempt the same calls again and report back with a full, data-driven fundamental report once the tools respond).
2) Proceed with a fundamental report that does not rely on insider data (company profile, basic financials, historical financial trends, and risk factors) and clearly mark the insider data as unavailable.
3) Use alternative sources you specify (if you have other data you’d like me to incorporate, I can integrate it).

If you’d like me to retry, I’ll run the data requests again immediately and then deliver a comprehensive report with:
- Company profile and business model (Alphabet/GOOGL)
- Recent financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) for the latest quarterly/annual period available
- Fundamental trends (revenue, margins, liquidity, capex, free cash flow) with analysis
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (once data is retrieved)
- Key risks and catalysts for traders
- A final Markdown table summarizing key points

Please tell me which option you prefer.
