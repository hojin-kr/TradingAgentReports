I attempted to pull data and run the indicator analyses for GOOGL, but the data fetch failed with a FileNotFoundError from the data source. This looks like a temporary environment issue with the data backend. I can retry, or proceed with a well-structured qualitative framework now and populate it with data as soon as the data fetch succeeds. In the meantime, here are the most relevant indicators I would use for a comprehensive, complementary view of GOOGL's current setup, along with why they’re suitable.

Selected indicators (up to 8), with rationale
1) close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average)
- What it measures: Intermediate-term trend, dynamic support/resistance.
- Why suitable for GOOGL: Helps you gauge the medium-term trajectory of this large-cap tech name and serves as a baseline for trend-following signals. When price sits above 50 SMA, it often indicates constructive intermediate momentum; a dip below can flag a pullback risk.

2) close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average)
- What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark.
- Why suitable for GOOGL: Acts as a major trend ratchet. Golden/death cross signals against 50 SMA or price crossing the 200 SMA can provide strategic confirmation of a longer-term regime shift, which is especially relevant for a high-cap heavyweight like Alphabet.

3) close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average)
- What it measures: Short-term momentum and quicker trend shifts.
- Why suitable for GOOGL: Captures fast price responses and can signal early entry/exit points when used with longer-term averages (e.g., cross above/below 50 SMA).

4) macd (MACD line)
- What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; trend-change potential.
- Why suitable for GOOGL: Helps identify momentum shifts and potential trend reversals via crossovers, divergence, and histogram behavior. Useful in combination with trend filters to reduce false positives.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- What it measures: Smoothing of MACD line; signal line crossovers.
- Why suitable for GOOGL: A MACD line crossing above/below the MACD Signal provides more robust trade signals than MACD alone when paired with other filters.

6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
- What it measures: Momentum strength (distance between MACD and its signal).
- Why suitable for GOOGL: Divergences between price and MACD histogram can precede price moves, and histogram expansion/contraction helps assess momentum strength in real time.

7) rsi (Relative Strength Index)
- What it measures: Momentum and overbought/oversold conditions (0–100 scale).
- Why suitable for GOOGL: RSI helps flag potential reversals when combined with trend context (e.g., a bullish signal in uptrends when RSI exits oversold territory; caution in strong uptrends when RSI stays overbought).

8) boll_ub (Bollinger Upper Band)
- What it measures: Volatility-adjusted breakout/overbought zone relative to a 20-day middle line.
- Why suitable for GOOGL: Signals potential breakout or overextended moves when price touches or rides the upper band, especially when corroborated by momentum (MACD/RSI) and trend (SMA/EMA) signals.

Notes on approach and how to use these indicators together
- Trend confirmation: Use the 50 SMA and 200 SMA to establish the prevailing trend. If price trades above both and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA, the bias is bullish; look for long entries on favorable momentum readings (MACD cross above the signal, rising MACD histogram, RSI not in overbought extremes if still in an uptrend).
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and its components (macd, macds, macdh) should align with price action and moving-average signals. For example, a MACD cross above the MACD Signal in a price breakout above the 50 SMA/bol_ub would strengthen a long setup.
- Short-term timing: Close_10_ema can help identify quicker shifts in momentum or potential entry points when price starts to cling above/below the 50 SMA, particularly in a choppier market.
- Volatility/structure context: Boll_ub provides a sense of potential breakout zones but should be filtered by MACD/R RSI to avoid chasing false breakouts in low-volume periods.

What I can provide once data is available
- A detailed, fine-grained trend and signal analysis with actual values for each indicator.
- Specific trading signals (e.g., “go long on a close above 50 SMA with bullish MACD crossover and RSI rising from ~45” or “watch for top formation if price tests boll_ub while RSI hits overbought”).
- Risk framing (potential stop levels using ATR-based concepts, suggested position sizing, and scenario planning).

Would you like me to:
- Retry fetching the data now to generate the actual indicator readings, or
- Proceed with a qualitative, scenario-based framework using these indicators and describe how to act in different hypothetical signal combinations for GOOGL?

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How it informs decisions for GOOGL | How to interpret signals (example scenarios) | Potential caveats |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Establish trend direction and dynamic floor/ceiling; use with momentum for entries | Price above 50 SMA and 50 SMA above 200 SMA = bullish bias; pullback toward 50 SMA may present a long setup if momentum supports | Lagging indicator; in choppy markets can give false signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms overall trend regime; strategic context | Price above 200 SMA with bullish cross of 50/200 is strong bull context; break below can signal long-term risk | Signals can lag during rapid regime changes |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum | Timely capture of quick shifts; supports entry timing | 10 EMA crossing above price or above 50 SMA can indicate near-term bullishness; cross below can signal caution | Prone to noise; use with longer MA confirmation |
| macd | MACD | Momentum; trend-change potential | Early momentum shifts; crossovers signal potential entries/exits | MACD line crossing above MACD Signal supports entry; bearish cross supports exit | Can give false positives in range-bound markets; filter with RSI or price action |
| macds | MACD Signal | MACD smoothing | Signal-line cross confirmations | MACD crossing above Signal strengthens MACD up-move; cross below weakens | Adds another lag; combine with price trend |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Gauge strength and divergences | Expanding histogram with price rise confirms trend; negative divergence warns of potential reversal | Can be volatile; use with other signals |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold; divergence | Timing around reversals; confirms trend with momentum | RSI rising toward overbought in uptrend can still stay valid; divergence early warning | In strong trends RSI can stay overbought; may need trend confirmation |
| boll_ub | Volatility/Breakout | Upper Bollinger Band for breakout/overbought zones | Spot potential breakouts and overextended moves | Price touching/breaking upper band with rising MACD/R RSI supports breakout; failure near band can precede pullbacks | Breakouts can occur in high-volatility sessions; confirm with volume |
