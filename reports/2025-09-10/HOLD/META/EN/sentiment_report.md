Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit sentiment data for META over Sep 4–Sep 10, 2025, but the Reddit stock-info tool is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError (both in parallel and in a single call). I can’t pull the daily Reddit sentiment data right now.

What I can do next (choose one or both):
- Retry data fetch shortly: I can attempt to run the Reddit data tool again in a few minutes and proceed with the full long report once it works.
- Proceed with a qualitative/alternative-data analysis: I can still produce a thorough META sentiment and news report using other sources (e.g., major press releases, earnings updates, regulatory/news headlines, and general social sentiment on platforms like X/Twitter, StockTwits, etc.) and clearly flag that Reddit data is unavailable due to tool error.
- You provide other data sources: If you have links or an alternative data feed you want included, I can incorporate them into the report.

If you’d like me to proceed now with an alternative data-focused report, I’ll cover:
- Recent META sentiment trends (qualitative) across the past week, highlighting any spikes driven by specific news or events.
- Key news items in the last week (earnings commentary, product updates, AR/VR developments, regulatory/regulatory actions, ad-market signals) and their potential impact on sentiment and price.
- Thematic drivers: AI/ML product momentum, metaverse/real-time collaboration product traction, advertising demand signals, regulatory/compliance considerations.
- Implications for traders:
  - Short-term catalysts to watch (news events, product launches, earnings commentary).
  - Risks (regulatory headlines, ad-market sensitivity, competition in AI/tech ecosystems).
  - Positioning considerations (how sentiment vs. fundamentals might diverge in the near term).
- A concise risk-aware takeaway and optional trading stance (based on qualitative data; no final buy/sell decision unless you request one).
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, themes, notable news items, sentiment signals, and potential implications.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want the full Reddit-backed analysis as soon as the tool is back, I’ll retry and then deliver the complete, structured long report with the Markdown summary table.
