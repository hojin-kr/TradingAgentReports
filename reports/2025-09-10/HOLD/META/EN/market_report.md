I attempted to fetch META data and the 8 indicator reports you asked for, but I ran into a backend error (FileNotFoundError) when querying the data sources. I can retry immediately, or adjust the date window and retry. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan with the chosen indicators and how I’d interpret them for META once the data is available. This will help you act quickly once the data feed returns.

Selected indicators (8) with rationale
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to gauge whether META is in a broader uptrend or downtrend and to confirm with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark (golden/death cross context). Helps confirm the overall market thesis for META; important for strategic positioning.
- macd: Momentum and trend-change signals via MACD line vs. signal line. Indicates potential swing entries when momentum shifts.
- macds: MACD Signal: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD provide additional confirmation to MACD signals.
- rsi: Momentum strength and potential reversals (overbought/oversold). Useful for timing within the trend, but beware of RSI staying elevated in strong trends.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a price benchmark. Helps identify mean reversion tendencies around a dynamic center and spot potential breakout zones relative to a statistical baseline.
- atr: Volatility measure for risk management (stop placement, position sizing). Gives a sense of current market volatility for META.
- vwma: Volume-weighted trend confirmation. Combines price action with volume, helping validate whether moves are supported by buying/selling pressure.

Nuanced interpretation framework for META (once data is available)
- Trend context:
  - If price is above both 50_sma and 200_sma, with the 50_sma rising toward or above the 200_sma, tilt toward a bullish backdrop.
  - If price is below both SMAs, with the 50_sma below the 200_sma, view as bearish or weak sideways risk.
- Momentum signals:
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal line and an increasing MACD histogram (macdh positive) strengthens a bullish case, especially when supported by rising RSI (not in overbought territory).
  - If MACD deteriorates (MACD crosses below Signal, histogram turns negative) while price holds above SMAs, expect potential pullbacks but watch for divergence with RSI.
- RSI context:
  - RSI breaking above 50-60 with price climbing can support a fresh up move, but RSI over 70+ in a sustained uptrend can indicate overbought risk and a potential pullback to support levels.
  - In a pullback, RSI approaching 30-40 can signal potential support and a resumption if other trend signals align.
- Volatility and risk:
  - ATR rising suggests increased volatility; use wider stops and smaller position sizing to manage risk.
  - If ATR tightens during a bullish setup, the move may be less volatile but with higher retracement risk if MACD/Bollinger signals don’t align.
- Volume confirmation:
  - VWMA moving in the same direction as price and MACD strength adds conviction to the move. Divergence between VWMA and price can warn of weakening momentum.
- Bollinger context:
  - Price testing the Bollinger Middle can indicate mean-reversion fights; a move above the upper Bollinger band with MACD bullish and VWMA confirming can indicate a breakout; a move to the lower band with bearish momentum can signal continuation of a down move or a reversal if supported by RSI.

Trading takeaways and signal construction (high-level)
- Bullish setup (example conditions)
  - Price above 50_sma and 200_sma, with 50_sma trending up toward 200_sma.
  - MACD line crosses above the MACD signal with positive MACD histogram (macdh rising).
  - RSI rising but not overbought (e.g., 50–65 range).
  - Price closes above Boll middle with price hugging or breaking above upper Boll band on increased VWMA-supported volume.
  - ATR rising or stable, indicating willing participation in the move.
- Bearish setup (example conditions)
  - Price below 50_sma and 200_sma, with 50_sma below 200_sma.
  - MACD line crosses below MACD signal with negative histogram.
  - RSI slipping toward 40–30 region but not excessively oversold, indicating risk of further downside if trend remains.
  - Price testing or breaking below Boll middle with momentum confirmed by shrinking VWMA or negative volume confirmation.
  - ATR rising to reflect higher risk/volatility, prompting cautious position sizing.

Risk management and position sizing
- Use ATR-based stop placement (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR for initial stop depending on risk tolerance).
- Consider VWMA as a confirmation filter to avoid entering on price moves lacking volume support.
- Limit exposure during high-volatility periods (rising ATR) or when RSI is in extreme territory (overbought near 70–80 or oversold near 20–30) unless multiple indicators align.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now and then present a fully computed report with the chosen indicators, their current values, and a structured set of entry/exit signals for META.
- If you prefer, I can also adjust the look-back window (e.g., 30–90 days) or the date reference (e.g., latest 60 trading days) to tailor the signals to a shorter-term or longer-term horizon.

Table: Key points at a glance
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance
  - How to interpret: Price above indicates uptrend; below indicates downtrend
  - How to use with META: Use as a trend filter alongside MACD and RSI for timing
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark
  - How to interpret: Price above suggests bullish macro context; below suggests bearish
  - How to use with META: Confirm strategic bias; cross with 50_sma for potential golden/death cross cues
- Indicator: macd
  - What it measures: Momentum and trend change
  - How to interpret: Bullish crossover and rising histogram = potential up move
  - How to use with META: Use with RSI and VWMA for confirmation
- Indicator: macds

  - How to use with META: Filter false signals with volume (VWMA)
- Indicator: rsi
  - What it measures: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold

Please tell me if you’d like me to retry fetching the data now (I’ll run the same set again) or adjust the date window and look-back period. Once the data comes back, I’ll deliver a full, computed report with the exact current indicator values and a concrete set of entry/exit suggestions for META.
