I attempted to fetch META fundamentals, but all tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError (data source/files missing). This prevents me from pulling insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the latest balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement from the configured data sources right now.

What I can do next:
- Retry data retrieval now or on your cue (sometimes these environments recover after a moment).
- If you prefer, proceed with a partial report focusing on methodology and what we will include once data is available (so you can review the plan and approve).
- If you have alternative data access (e.g., another API key or dataset) you want me to use, share it and I’ll integrate it.

Proposed plan for META fundamentals (to be filled when data is available)
- Company profile and industry context
- Latest quarterly/annual financials (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow)
- Key financial metrics and trends (revenue growth, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, ROE/ROA, leverage, liquidity)
- Cash flow quality and capital allocation (FCF, capex, debt issuance/repayment)
- Profitability and efficiency analysis (gross margin trend, operating leverage, asset turnover)
- Balance sheet health (net debt, liquidity ratios, working capital)
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (tailwinds/headwinds from insiders)
- Recent developments and risk factors affecting fundamentals
- Trader-oriented takeaways and risk-adjusted theses

Sample Markdown table (to fill in after data is available)
- This table will summarize key items in a compact format.

| Area | Key Points | Data Source | Signal for Traders |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue |  | Income Statement | Positive/Negative trend; acceleration vs. prior period |
| Gross Margin |  | Income Statement | Expansion/Contraction; margin quality |
| Operating Margin |  | Income Statement | Operating leverage indicators |
| Net Income / EPS |  | Income Statement | Profitability trend; one-time items if any |
| Free Cash Flow |  | Cash Flow | Cash generation quality |
| Balance Sheet | Net debt, liquidity | Balance Sheet | Leverage risk; liquidity buffers |
| Insider Sentiment | 30-day tone | Insider Sentiment | Bullish/Bearish driver expectations |
| Insider Transactions | Net buys/sells | Insider Transactions | Potential catalysts or red flags |
| Capital Allocation | Buybacks, dividends, capex | Cash Flow / Notes | Shareholder value signal |
| Risk factors | Key exposure notes | All sources | Specific risk mitigation needs |

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry now and then immediately compile a full, detailed report with all sections and the final Markdown table as soon as the data sources respond. Would you like me to retry the data fetch now?
