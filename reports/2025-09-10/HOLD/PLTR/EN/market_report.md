I tried to fetch PLTR price data (PLTR, 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-10) using the provided data tool, but the data retrieval failed with a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source in this environment is temporarily unavailable. I can retry the data fetch, or proceed with a robust indicator plan you can use as soon as the data is accessible. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators and a nuanced framework tailored for PLTR, plus how to interpret signals once the data loads.

Selected indicators (8 total) with rationale
- close_200_sma
  - Why: Long-term trend anchor. Helps confirm broad directional bias (bullish if price is above, bearish if below; watch for potential golden/death cross with shorter moving averages).
- close_50_sma
  - Why: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Crosses with price or the 200 SMA can signal trend changes or pullbacks.
- close_10_ema
  - Why: Short-term momentum barometer. More responsive to recent moves; useful as an early entry/exit nudge when used with longer-timeframe filters.
- macd
  - Why: Core momentum signal. Crossovers (MACD line vs MACD signal) indicate potential trend changes; useful in conjunction with price structure and other indicators.
- macds
  - Why: MACD signal line. Crossovers with the MACD line provide clearer trigger points and help reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- macdh
  - Why: MACD histogram. Gauges momentum strength and can reveal divergence early; helps validate or warn against MACD cross signals.
- rsi
  - Why: Momentum and overbought/oversold context. Signals like 70/30 thresholds and divergences can indicate potential reversals or continuation in the context of the prevailing trend.
- boll
  - Why: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA) as a baseline for volatility-adjusted levels. Useful to assess breakout potential and mean-reversion tendencies when price interacts with bands.

How to interpret signals for PLTR in current market conditions (framework)
- Trend context (200 SMA and 50 SMA)
  - Price above both SMAs: constructive longer-term backdrop; look for pullbacks toward the 50 SMA as potential buyers’ zone, confirm with momentum signals.
  - Price below both SMAs: risk-off or downtrend context; any rallies near the 50 or 200 SMA should be tested for resistance before setup.
  - Golden cross (50 SMA crossing above 200 SMA) or death cross (50 SMA crossing below 200 SMA): use as a confirmation backdrop, not a sole trigger.
- Short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD family)
  - Price crossing above/below the 10 EMA can indicate short-term momentum shifts; validate with MACD (macd) cross and histogram (macdh) strength.
  - MACD cross above signal line (macds crossing up macd): potential bullish signal; MACD histogram turning positive (macdh rising) adds confirmation.
- Momentum strength and reversals (RSI)
  - RSI rising from oversold toward 50-60 range can accompany a bullish setup; RSI overextended into 70+ in an uptrend could require caution or confirmation from price action.
  - Divergences between price and RSI can foreshadow reversals, especially if the price action is forming a higher swing with RSI failing to make new highs.
- Volatility and breakouts (Boll)
  - Price hugging or riding the Bollinger Middle (boll) in a trending context may indicate continued directional movement; a move toward the upper band (boll_ub) can signal strength, while touching the lower band (boll_lb) can indicate potential reversals or oversold conditions in pullbacks.
- Volume context (VWMA)
  - While not listed in the eight chosen, VWMA is a helpful companion to confirm volume-supported moves. If price moves with rising VWMA, it adds conviction; if price advances on low volume, be wary of a possible consolidation.

Nuanced scenario considerations for PLTR
- Bullish setup would ideally show:
  - Price above 200 SMA and 50 SMA, with recent cross of 50 above 200 (or at least price hovering above these levels).
  - MACD line above the MACD signal with a rising macdh, and RSI trending up but not overbought.
  - Price testing or breaking the upper Bollinger band with a constructive candle pattern, supported by rising volume (VWMA corroboration when available).
- Bearish setup would ideally show:
  - Price below 200 SMA and 50 SMA, with potential death cross signals in play.
  - MACD line crossing below the MACD signal, macdh turning negative or widening negative.
  - RSI rolling over from overbought, or showing bearish divergence against rising price; price moving toward lower Bollinger band with selling pressure.
- Range-bound or choppy conditions:
  - Movements around the 50 SMA with price repeatedly testing the Bollinger middle; need confirmation from MACD and RSI that momentum isn’t turning aggressively in either direction.

What to monitor once data is back
- Watch the alignment of trend (200/50 SMAs) with short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD family) to identify viable entries.
- Use RSI to flag potential reversals but avoid acting on RSI alone in strong trends.
- Use Bollinger bands to gauge breakout vs. mean-reversion likelihood and to judge whether price action is expanding volatility (atr can be used for stop placement, though not in the final 8 indicators list).
- Validate signals with price action patterns (candles, support/resistance near SMA levels) before trading.

Proposed actionable checklist (once data is available)
- Confirm price above or below 200 SMA and 50 SMA.
- Check MACD line vs MACD signal (macd vs macds) and MACD histogram (macdh) for momentum confirmation.
- Check 10 EMA for short-term momentum direction M trends.
- Check RSI level and possible divergences.
- Observe price relation to Bollinger Middle and Bands for breakout/mean-reversion cues.
- If available, corroborate with VWMA for volume-confirmed moves.

Would you like me to retry fetching PLTR data now, or would you prefer that I proceed with generating a detailed indicator-driven plan using any data that becomes available later? If you’d like, I can also run a quick, scenario-based update once the data fetch succeeds and provide concrete signal thresholds tailored to PLTR’s current price range.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation (ready to populate with live data once available)

| Indicator | Role | What signals to look for in PLTR | How this might influence trading decisions |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_200_sma | Trend backbone | Price above/below 200 SMA; cross with 50 SMA | Confirm long-term trend; use as filter for entries |
| close_50_sma | Intermediate trend | Price crossing 50 SMA; relation to 200 SMA | Validate trend direction; pullbacks to 50 SMA as potential entries |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price >/ < 10 EMA; cross with price action | Early entry/exit prompts; quick momentum checks |
| macd | Momentum | MACD line vs MACD signal; histogram changes | Trigger signals; confirm with price action and other indicators |
| macds | MACD signal | Cross of MACD with MACD signal | Additional confirmation for trades |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/ contraction; divergences | Gauge strength of move; warn of exhaustion |
| rsi | Momentum/overbought | RSI near 70/30; divergences | Reversal risk signals; combine with trend direction |
| boll | Volatility/mean reversion | Price near/through Bollinger bands | Breakout vs mean-reversion cues; confirm with other signals |

Note: The above is a robust framework that assumes data will load. I’ll re-run the data fetch as soon as the environment allows, and I can then tailor each indicator’s readings and provide concrete entry/exit signals for PLTR.
