Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull the latest Reddit stock chatter for PLTR on 2025-09-10, but the Reddit data tool is returning a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source or environment needed by the tool is currently unavailable, so I can’t fetch the Reddit-sourced sentiment for that date right now.

What would you like to do next? Here are practical options:

- Option 1: Retry now. I can try calling the Reddit data tool again in a moment to see if the issue resolves.
- Option 2: Proceed with an alternative data approach. I can build a comprehensive analysis using:
  - Public news headlines about PLTR from the past week
  - General sentiment trends from other social channels (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits) if you have access to them or want me to rely on available public summaries
  - Company announcements, earnings chatter, and regulatory/UGE news
  - Historical context and typical responses around Palantir’s news cycles
- Option 3: Do a hybrid approach. I can draft the full long-form report structure and a MakrMarkdown table now, with placeholders for Reddit sentiment. Once the Reddit tool is back, I’ll fill in the exact figures and quotes and update the conclusions accordingly.
- Option 4: Analyze a different ticker or date window if you want to test the workflow.

If you’d like, I can start with Option 2 (alternative sources) or Option 3 (structure + placeholders). Also, if you have any specific sources you want included (e.g., a list of news outlets or social accounts), share them and I’ll tailor the analysis around them.

Would you prefer I retry the Reddit tool now, or shift to an alternative data approach and begin the long report with a placeholder section for Reddit data?
