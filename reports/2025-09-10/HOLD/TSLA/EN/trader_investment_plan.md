Recommendation: HOLD

Rationale aligned with the plan:
- The bull case offers substantial optionality (software moat, energy storage, international growth, and potential Robotaxi upside), but near-term catalysts remain uncertain and the stock carries a high valuation sensitive to policy, regulation, and timing of Robotaxi milestones.
- The bear case—policy shifts, share dilution concerns, and execution risk around Robotaxi economics—remains credible and could cap multiple expansion in the near term.
- A Hold with hedging preserves optionality while limiting downside, which fits a cautious stance until catalysts clarify.

Concrete hedging and risk-management plan (actionable):
- Core exposure: Maintain a measured long position to preserve optionality (international demand, software monetization, and energy/storage upside).
- Hedging overlay (cost-efficient and dynamic):
  - Collar approach (preferred): Buy a protective put (downside protection) and finance it by selling an out-of-the-money call (cap upside). The put provides defined downside risk; the short call funds part of the hedge while keeping upside exposure intact.
  - Alternative: Put spread for a tighter premium if cost is a concern (long put at a lower strike, short put further below).
  - Simple one-leg hedge option: Consider a long-dated protective put around key catalyst windows if you want a straightforward structure.
- Position sizing and risk controls:
  - Ensure the core position size aligns with your total risk budget so a material drawdown remains within your tolerance.
  Set a clear stop/ reassessment rule tied to a moving-average or defined technical level to trigger a realignment.
- Catalyst calendar and monitoring:
  - Policy developments affecting EV credits and subsidies.
  - Robotaxi milestones (regulatory clearances, profitability milestones, and fleet utilization progress).
  - International demand signals (China/Europe), pricing, and gross margin trajectory.
  - Review after each catalyst event; if Robotaxi economics become credible and policy risk moderates, shift toward a more constructive stance; if catalysts disappoint, tighten hedges or reduce exposure.
- Time horizon and review cadence:
  - 6–12 months, with quarterly reviews around earnings and policy cycles.

What would trigger a reclassification to BUY or SELL:
- Move to BUY: Clear, durable improvements in Robotaxi economics, credible monetization of software, sustainable margin/fcf improvement, and a favorable policy backdrop that reduces downside vs. upside risk.
- Move to SELL: Sustained policy/regulatory setbacks, weaker-than-expected margins or free cash flow, or evidence that Robotaxi economics cannot reach credible profitability at scale.
- If catalysts remain mixed with no clear path to relief or improvement, maintain HOLD and adjust hedges as needed.

If you want, I can tailor exact hedge strikes and expiry dates to your current price, position size, and risk tolerance, and map a concrete ladder of entry/exit points around a specific catalyst calendar.
