Thanks for the nudge. Quick status: I attempted to fetch TSLA Reddit stock-info for 2025-09-10, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal backend issue). I’ve tried twice, so this looks like a temporary outage or misconfiguration on the tool side.

What I can do next (your call):
- Retry now: I can attempt another fetch immediately to see if the issue clears.
- Pause and wait: I can queue up the analysis and kick off as soon as the tool returns data.
- Use an alternative approach: If you’re open to it, I can proceed with a qualitative TSLA sentiment/news analysis framework and structure, and then fill in the specifics once the Reddit feed is accessible again.

What I’ll deliver once data is available:
- A comprehensive long-form report covering TSLA sentiment on social media (daily breakdown over the past week), notable posts/themes, and how these align with recent company news.
- A trader-focused interpretation: sentiment momentum, potential catalysts, risk factors, and actionable takeaways (short-term swing considerations, volatility drivers, and potential scenarios).
- A clear, reader-friendly Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, drivers, and implications for traders.

If you’d like me to retry now, say “Retry,” and I’ll run another fetch immediately. If you prefer, I can proceed with the outline and come back with filled insights as soon as the data is available. Also, if you have particular Reddit threads or sources you want included, share them and I’ll prioritize them once the data tool is functioning.
