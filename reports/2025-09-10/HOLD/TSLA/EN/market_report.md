I tried to fetch TSLA data for you, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I don’t currently have live TSLA numbers to compute and display exact indicator values. I can still give you a solid, trader-focused setup tailored for TSLA and explain how to interpret it once you have the data. When the data fetch is working again, I can plug in the actual readings and give precise signals.

Recommended 8-indicator setup for TSLA (complementary, non-redundant)

- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum via a fast exponential moving average.
  - How to use: Look for price crossing above/below the 10 EMA for quick entry/exit cues. In TSLA’s volatility regime, 10 EMA helps flag rapid shifts, but confirm with longer-term trend (50/200 SMAs) to avoid whipsaws.

- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and potential dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: If price stays above 50 SMA, the intermediate trend is bullish; if below, it's bearish. Watch for a 50/200 cross as a longer-term trend signal (golden cross or death cross).

- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: Long-term trend baseline.
  - How to use: Use it as macro trend confirmation. A golden cross (50 crossing above 200) strengthens a bullish thesis; a death cross weakens it. Useful for bias rather than precise entries.

- macd
  - What it measures: Momentum and trend strength via the difference of two EMAs.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossing the signal line for potential entry/exit signals. In conjunction with price above/below the 50/200 SMAs, a MACD crossover can indicate a strengthening/breaking move.

- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD histogram, momentum strength (how far MACD is from its signal).
  - How to use: Rising, positive histogram supports bullish momentum; falling, negative histogram supports bearish momentum. Divergence between price action and MACD histogram can foreshadow reversals.

- rsi
  - What it measures: Short-to-intermediate momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: Typical thresholds are 70 (overbought) and 30 (oversold). In strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; use in combination with trend signals to avoid premature exits. Watch for bullish/bearish divergences with price.

- boll_ub
  - What it measures: Upper Bollinger Band, reflecting price volatility and potential overbought pressure.
  - How to use: Price testing or crossing above the upper band can signal overbought conditions or a breakout in a strong uptrend. In TSLA’s volatile environment, bands can ride the price during strong moves; confirm with other indicators.

- boll_lb
  - What it measures: Lower Bollinger Band, reflecting support and potential oversold pressure.
  - How to use: Price touching or crossing the lower band can indicate oversold conditions or a potential reversal. Use with RSI and trend context to avoid catching falling knives in a bear move.

Notes on TSLA-specific context
- TSLA tends to exhibit high volatility and sizable momentum shifts driven by news, product cycles, and tech/EV sentiment. A multi-indicator approach that blends trend (50/200 SMAs), momentum (10 EMA, MACD/macdH, RSI), and volatility (Bollinger bands) helps filter noise.
- The 50/200 SMA relationship is particularly informative for longer-term bias, while the 10 EMA provides quick signals that can be filtered by MACD/macdH and RSI to reduce false positives in choppy markets.
- Bollinger bands are especially useful for volatility regimes in TSLA. A price that consistently hugs or rides the upper band may indicate strong up-moves, but tend to require confirmation from momentum (MACD/macdH) and trend direction (price relative to 50/200 SMA).

How signals could look in practice (scenarios)
- Bullish setup (confluence):
  - Price above 50 and 200 SMAs, 10 EMA crossing above price, MACD rising with histogram positive, RSI climbing but not yet in extreme overbought territory, price testing the upper Bollinger band with a widening band.
  - Possible action: consider a long entry if MACD confirms and RSI is supportive, with risk controls around the ATR-based stop if volatility expands.

- Bearish setup (confluence):
  - Price below 50 and 200 SMAs, 10 EMA crossing below price, MACD declining with negative histogram, RSI failing to push higher and showing bearish divergence, price touching lower Bollinger band and breaking below it with clear momentum.
  - Possible action: consider a short/exit option or hedge, with stops based on recent ATR levels.

- Neutral/sideways setup:
  - Price oscillating around the 50 SMA with no clear MACD momentum, RSI hovering near midpoints, bands showing contracting volatility.
  - Possible action: reduce position size, wait for a clearer breakout or a confluence of signals.

Next steps and how I can help
- If you can re-run the data fetch (or provide a CSV), I’ll compute the exact indicator values and produce:
  - A concise signal read for TSLA (entries/exits with suggested stop levels).
  - A summarized trend assessment (short, medium, long-term) based on the current data.
  - A tactical plan (entries, exits, risk management) calibrated to your preferred timeframe.

Proposed 8-indicator table (overview)

- Indicator | What it measures | How to use for TSLA
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Signals quick shifts; use with longer-term trend filters
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; watch for 50 vs 200 cross
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Macro bias; golden/death cross signals strategic rather than frequent
- macd | Momentum and trend strength | Crossovers signal potential moves; confirm with RSI and price trend
- macdh | Momentum strength (histogram) | Increasing histogram supports bulls; decreasing supports bears
- rsi | Momentum/overbought-oversold | 70/30 thresholds; beware divergences in strong trends
- boll_ub | Upper volatility band | Possible overbought breakout zone; seek confirmation from MACD/RSI
- boll_lb | Lower volatility band | Possible oversold reversal zone; confirm with RSI/price trend

Markdown table (key points)

| Indicator | What it measures | Interpretation cues (TSLA) | Trade considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; cross above price can hint entries | Use with 50/200 SMA trend; avoid choppy market entries |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Above/below indicates bias; cross with 200 SMA = strategic signals | Golden cross = bullish bias; death cross = bearish bias |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Determines macro trend direction | Prioritize direction; use for position sizing and risk framing |
| macd | Momentum/trend strength | Crosses and zero-line movements indicate momentum shifts | Confirm with price action and RSI to reduce false signals |
| macdh | Momentum strength (histogram) | Positive growth = bullish momentum; negative = bearish | Divergence with price is a potential reversal cue |
| rsi | Momentum/overbought-oversold | >70 overbought, <30 oversold; watch for divergences | In strong trends, avoid overreliance on RSI alone; confirm with trend |
| boll_ub | Upper volatility band | Price near/above band suggests overbought pressure or breakout zone | Require MACD/RSI confirmation; bands can be ridden in strong uptrends |
| boll_lb | Lower volatility band | Price near/below band suggests oversold pressure | Look for reversal patterns or trend continuation with other signals |

Important: I’m ready to run the data once the tool is available again. If you want, I can also adjust the indicator set (e.g., add VWMA for volume confirmation or ATR for explicit volatility-based risk controls) if you’re targeting a different trading style (scalp, swing, or position). Just say the word and I’ll tailor the output to your preferred timeframe and risk tolerance.
