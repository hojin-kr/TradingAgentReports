Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based stock sentiment data for QQQ for the requested dates, but the Reddit data tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError across multiple attempts. It looks like the data source or environment is temporarily unavailable on my end. I can’t pull the daily Reddit sentiment stream right now.

What I can do right now
- Prepare a comprehensive, trader-focused report structure that you can fill in once the Reddit data tool is back online (or you provide manual summaries).
- Start with a solid framework: sentiment methodology, data sources, key drivers for QQQ, and clear implications for traders.
- If you’d like, I can retry the Reddit data fetch in the background and notify you when it returns, or we can switch to another data source you approve (e.g., manual summaries, other social platforms) if you have permissions or access.

Recommended plan (given the tool is temporarily down)
1) Data and method
   - Objective: Assess public sentiment around QQQ (the ETF) over the past week using Reddit posts and comments, plus feed in any accompanying headlines or articles.
   - Time window: 2025-09-04 to 2025-09-10 (latest to earliest).
   - Metrics (to fill once data is available):
     - Daily sentiment score (e.g., average polarity, scaled -1 to +1 or 0-100).
     - Post volume and engagement (count, upvotes/comments).
     - Top keywords and themes per day (tech stocks, AI, earnings, FED, etc.).
     - Notable headlines or threads by day (summary bullets).

2) Context and interpretation (what to look for once data is in)
   - ETF-level drivers: Since QQQ is tech-heavy, sentiment around mega-cap names (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, etc.) and AI-related developments will disproportionately influence QQQ sentiment.
   - News catalysts likely to move sentiment: AI breakthroughs, regulatory headlines affecting tech, earnings beats/mails from top holdings, macro shifts (rates, inflation, tech spending), and geopolitical risk impacting tech supply chains.
   - Sentiment vs. price action: Identify whether sentiment moves precede, coincide with, or lag behind price moves on QQQ.

3) Daily narrative framework (fill this with actual data later)
   - Date:
     - Sentiment score:
     - Volume stat:
     - Top themes/keywords:
     - Notable posts/headlines:
     - Implied implications for QQQ:
     - Trading stance considerations (short-term bias, risk factors, hedging ideas).

4) Potential trading implications (high-level, no commitments)
   - Positive sentiment day(s) for QQQ likely align with strength in mega-cap tech and AI-driven optimism; potential for short-term upside, with caveats around risk-on tech rotation and macro headwinds.
   - Negative sentiment day(s) may reflect profit-taking in big tech, fears about regulatory constraints, or macro uncertainty; could imply near-term pullbacks or increased volatility.
   - Over the week, watch for divergence between sentiment momentum and price action as a potential signal (e.g., improving sentiment while price drifts lower).

5) Limitations and data gaps
   - Reddit data quality can be noisy; spikes may reflect a few highly upvoted threads rather than broad consensus.
   - Since QQQ tracks many large tech names, segment sentiment by theme (AI, hardware, software, cloud, semis) to avoid over-generalization.

6) Output format plan (ending with a Markdown table)
   - I’ll deliver a detailed narrative analysis, followed by a Markdown table summarizing key daily points, with a clean, trader-friendly layout.

Proposed deliverable now
- I can provide a full, ready-to-fill report template (with sections like the plan above and placeholders for data) plus a final Markdown table that you can paste in once the data arrives.
- If you prefer, I can also draft a version focused on macro/news catalysts and ETF-level considerations (without Reddit data) to ensure you have something actionable in the meantime.

If you want me to proceed with the template now, I’ll deliver:
- A complete report outline (section-by-section) plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table.
- A note about data gaps and what to expect once Reddit data returns.

Would you like me to proceed with the template now, or would you prefer I retry pulling Reddit data in the background and notify you when it succeeds? If you have any alternative data sources you want me to use in the meantime (e.g., manual summaries you provide, or another platform), tell me and I’ll incorporate them.
