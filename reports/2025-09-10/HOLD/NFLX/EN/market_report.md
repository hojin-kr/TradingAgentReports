I attempted to fetch NFLX data for the requested window, but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data fetch now, or we can adjust the date range if you prefer. In the meantime, here is a plan with a carefully chosen set of indicators and how I’d interpret them for NFLX as of this market context.

Selected indicators (up to 8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Why these indicators are suitable
- close_50_sma: Captures the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for identifying the current trend direction and potential pullbacks.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm the broader regime (bullish/bearish) and spot significant trend shifts via crossovers.
- close_10_ema: Responsive momentum proxy for short-term shifts. Helps flag last-step timing when used in conjunction with longer-term trends.
- macd: Momentum and trend-change signal through the difference of EMAs. Crosses and its slope help identify potential trend changes or continuations.
- macdh: MACD histogram conveys momentum strength and divergence signals. Useful to confirm MACD direction and spot weakening/strengthening momentum sooner.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold extremes and potential reversals; useful with trend context to avoid chasing false reversals.
- atr: Volatility measure to gauge price dispersion and inform risk management (e.g., stop distances, position sizing) in current market conditions.
- vwma: Volume-weighted confirmation of price action. Helps distinguish price moves driven by genuine buying/selling from those supported by higher volume.

How I’ll interpret signals (high level)
- Trends: Use 50_sma and 200_sma to determine trend direction and potential regime shifts. Look for alignment (e.g., price above both maturing into uptrend) or crossovers (golden/death cross) for strategic context.
- Momentum: Use macd and macdh together to gauge momentum direction and strength; a rising macdh with MACD above its signal reinforces bullish momentum, while a falling macdh with MACD crossing below the signal reinforces caution.
- Short-term timing: Use close_10_ema for quick momentum shifts, but confirm with MACD and RSI to avoid early entries in choppy markets.
- Reversion risk: RSI can signal potential reversals when in extreme overbought/oversold zones, especially if the price is not confirming the RSI move with trend signals (e.g., price near resistance with RSI near 70+).
- Volatility and risk: ATR informs how wide to set stops and how much capital to risk per trade in the current volatility regime; higher ATR means wider stops but also bigger potential moves.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA helps validate whether price moves are supported by higher-volume participation; use VWMA crossovers or price action that walks with VWMA as more reliable breakouts or breakdowns.

Next steps
- I can retry the NFLX data fetch with the same window (2024-09-10 to 2025-09-10) or adjust to a shorter window (e.g., last 12–18 months) if you’d prefer.
- Once data is retrieved, I will compute the selected indicators and deliver:
  - A detailed trend/momentum/volatility report
  - Specific observations and potential trade ideas (if you want, I can frame them as watchlist signals rather than explicit buy/sell recommendations)
  - A concise summary of the key signals and risk considerations

Please tell me:
- Should I retry fetching NFLX data for the original date range, or would you like a shorter window (e.g., last 6–12 months)?
- Do you want explicit buy/hold/sell labels, or would you prefer a watchlist-style analysis with signal interpretations only?

Markdown table: Key indicators and their role (plan-ready)
| Indicator | Category | What it measures / why it’s useful | How to interpret signals (high-level) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA suggests uptrend/downtrend; cross with price action for pullbacks or breakouts |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark; confirms regime | Price above 200SMA indicates bullish bias; price below suggests bearish bias; golden/death cross with shorter MA provides strategic cues |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Responsive short-term momentum | Quick shifts; use with longer MAs to filter false signals; price cross above/below 10EMA can hint at near-term entries/exits |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line vs. signal | MACD line crossing above/below the signal line indicates momentum changes; aim to confirm with histogram and RSI |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence cues | Expanding histogram supports momentum; shrinking/negative histogram warns of weakening momentum; watch for divergences with price |
| rsi | Momentum Indicator | Overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals | RSI above ~70 indicates overbought; below ~30 indicates oversold; consider trend context and divergences |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level; risk management guidance | Rising ATR suggests wider price swings; adjust stops/position sizes accordingly; use with risk limits |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Price action confirmed by volume; trend confirmation | Price moving with VWMA or crossing it adds conviction to the move; divergence between price and VWMA can warn of reversals |

If you’d like, I can proceed to retry the data fetch now and then generate the full indicator outputs and a deeper, data-driven narrative once the data is in.
