# Sentiment Report

Apologies — the news data fetch for AAPL on 2025-08-29 hit a backend error (AttributeError in the OpenAI news wrapper). I’m currently unable to retrieve the latest company news. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

- Retry now: I can attempt the news fetch again immediately.
- Retry after a short wait: I can retry in a few minutes to give the API time to recover.
- Use alternative sources: I can pull from other public news feeds or press releases if you’d like (e.g., investor relations releases, major media outlets, or social media sentiment summaries from other services).
- Proceed with methodology only: I can outline the full analysis framework and data points I will collect once I have the data, then run the analysis as soon as the news feed is working.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to proceed with the framework now, I can deliver a detailed long-report template (without live data) so you’ll have a ready-to-fill structure as soon as the feed comes back.

What I will deliver in the full report (once data is available)
- Social sentiment analysis: daily sentiment trajectory over the past week for AAPL from social platforms, microblogs, and public discussions; identify whether sentiment is positive, mixed, or negative and the drivers behind shifts (e.g., product rumors, supply chain news, services milestones, regulatory concerns).
- News synthesis: a synthesis of the most impactful headlines from the past week, including earnings/guide updates, product news, leadership commentary, regulatory issues, and market reactions.
- Drivers and catalysts: pin down recurring themes that move sentiment and potential catalysts (new product announcements, earnings timing, anti-trust/regulatory updates, major partnerships, supply chain updates).
- Price and volatility context: relate sentiment/news signals to price action, intraday volatility, and volume changes; identify potential lead-lag relationships.
- Trader-focused implications: actionable takeaways for different trading horizons (intraday, swing, and position traders), including risk factors and potential entry/exit ideas tied to catalysts.
- Risk considerations: sentiment overreaction risks, data-sourcing limits, and how to combine with other indicators (momentum, earnings expectations, valuation context).

Proposed Markdown table to summarize key points (added at the end of the report)
| Section | Key Points (placeholder until data arrives) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Data sources | Social sentiment from major platforms; public company news; investor sentiment indicators | Pending data fetch |
| Timeframe | Past 7 days of data | Pending data fetch |
| Sentiment framework | Positive / Neutral / Negative; drivers identified per day | Pending data fetch |
| News impact | Headlines by day; top catalysts; market reaction | Pending data fetch |
| Trading implications | Short-term catalysts; risk management prompts | Pending data fetch |
| Next steps | Retry news API or switch sources; compile full report | Pending data fetch |

If you’d like me to retry immediately, say “Retry now,” or tell me to wait a few minutes and try again. If you prefer an alternative data source approach, tell me which sources you want prioritized (e.g., Reuters/Bloomberg headlines, Apple press releases, or social sentiment from a specific platform).
