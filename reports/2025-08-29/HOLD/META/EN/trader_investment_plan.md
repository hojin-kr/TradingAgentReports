# Trader Investment Plan

Recommendation: HOLD META now.

Rationale (why this stance aligns with the plan and current setup)
- Near-term momentum: RSI around 46 and a fading MACD suggest the uptrend is pausing rather than accelerating. Price sits above key trend lines but has not demonstrated a decisive breakout on strong volume.
- Key levels to watch: Support zone around 735–751 provides a cushion if downside pressure resumes. A robust, volume-confirmed breakout above ~792.86 would be the clear catalyst for re-establishing upside momentum.
- Long-term thesis intact: AI-driven monetization, a large first-party data flywheel, and a broad ecosystem support a durable longer-term narrative. The near-term AI capex, regulatory considerations, and ad-market sensitivity keep the risk/reward balanced in the meantime.
- Valuation and risk: The stock is not a clear cheap buy given capital intensity and potential near-term earnings volatility if AI ROI lags or macro/regulatory headwinds worsen. Hence, chasing here is not prudent.

Position guidance
- If you are already long:
  - Maintain exposure with disciplined risk controls. Consider a stop placed below the near-term dynamic support around 735 (or just below 751 if you prefer a tighter vicinity), using an ATR buffer (roughly 1x–1.5x current ATR).
  - Hedge or diversify some exposure to limit downside if near-term catalysts disappoint (e.g., GOOG, MSFT, or an AI-focused ETF).
  - Look to add only on a confirmed momentum restart: a MACD cross up and RSI re-acceleration toward 55–60, together with a decisive breakout above resistance on higher-than-average volume.
- If you are not yet long:
  - Do not chase here. Consider entry only on a confluence of signals:
    - Price pullback toward 735–751 with solid support,
    - Momentum re-acceleration (MACD cross up, RSI climbing toward 55–60),
    - A clear breakout beyond 792.86 with strong volume.
  - If you do take a position, size prudently and scale in only on confirmed momentum, with ATR-based risk sizing.

Monitoring checklist (quick, practical)
- Is META holding above 50SMA and above 751 with increasing volume?
- Is MACD turning up and RSI moving toward 55–60?
- Is there a decisive breakout above 792.86 on meaningful volume?
- Are there any fresh regulatory or AI governance headlines that could shift risk?

Learning from approach (kept in mind)
- Distinguish momentum blips from trend shifts; confirmation signals matter before adding risk.
- Separate near-term volatility from the long-term thesis; avoid overreacting to quarterly noise.
- Use a scenario-based framework with explicit catalysts to change position posture.

Final decision
- HOLD

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
