# Fundamentals Report

Thanks for the prompt. I’m running into a technical issue with the fundamentals tool (get_fundamentals_openai) when trying to fetch META data for 2025-08-29. The tool is returning an internal error (AttributeError related to a web-search response object), so I can’t pull the latest numbers right now.

Here are two practical paths forward. Choose the one you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly:

Option A — Retry once the tool is healthy
- I’ll retry the same fundamentals fetch for META on 2025-08-29 and then produce a comprehensive report with a Markdown table of key fundamentals and sources.
- This will include: company profile, revenue by segment, profitability metrics, cash flow (CFO, FCF), debt/equity, liquidity, recent trends, and any relevant insider sentiment/transactions when available from recent filings or trusted sources.

Option B — Manual, high-quality fundamentals snapshot (no tool required)
- I’ll deliver a structured, trader-focused META fundamentals report based on publicly available information up to mid-2024 (and the general business context for 2025), clearly labeling data that is post-cutoff as unavailable or estimated.
- I’ll include a detailed qualitative assessment of drivers (advertising market, AI initiatives, platform ecosystem, data monetization, regulatory risks) and a conservative set of metrics (e.g., latest reported revenue, margins, cash flow signals, debt, buyback activity) with explicit caveats.
- I’ll still end with a Markdown table that outlines the key points, but numbers may be placeholder or ranges if up-to-date figures aren’t retrieved.

If you want the most current numbers (Option A), I’ll retry as soon as the tool is available again. If you’re okay with a robust, well-sourced snapshot that’s not dependent on the latest weekly fetch (Option B), I can deliver that right away.

If you’re ready, please confirm which option you prefer:
- Retry the live data fetch for 2025-08-29 (Option A)
- Proceed with a manual fundamentals report (Option B)

In addition, please confirm the preferred metrics and format. A typical, trader-friendly layout I can produce includes:
- Metrics: Revenue, Net Income, EBITDA/Operating Income, CFO, FCF, Revenue growth, Net Margin, P/E (ttm/forward), P/S, Debt/Equity, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Share count, Buyback activity
- Timeframe: end-of-period snapshot (most recent quarter/year), with commentary on sequential/YoY trends
- Format: Markdown table at the end, plus a concise narrative for context and triggers

If you want a different set of metrics (e.g., include EV/EBITDA, P/B, user metrics, ARPU, etc.), just say the word and I’ll tailor it.
