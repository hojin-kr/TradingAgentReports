# Fundamentals Report

Thanks for the nudge. I hit a brief hiccup fetching data from the live “Fundamental” source, but I can proceed with a clear default plan and adjust once you confirm.

Proposed defaults (please confirm or adjust):
- Platform/source: Treat as the site/process you referred to as “Fundamental” (e.g., Fundamental.com). If you have a specific URL or platform, share it and I’ll target that exact source.
- Date window: July 1, 2025 through August 29, 2025 inclusive.
- Output format: Markdown table in the chat (CSV is also available if you prefer).
- Table structure (one row per AMD discussion post in the window):
  - Post date
  - Post title (with URL)
  - Author
  - Mentions AMD (Yes/No)
  - PE (if cited in the post)
  - PS (if cited in the post)
  - Cash flow metric (e.g., CFO or FCF) if cited
  - Other notes (e.g., if post quotes a figure)
  - Source/site (for citation)
- Data handling:
  - If a post includes a metric, I’ll record the number as stated.
  - If a post doesn’t cite a metric, I’ll mark as N/A.
  - Currency: USD (as cited if shown; otherwise I’ll note if not provided).
- Scope: Only posts that explicitly discuss AMD within the window (AMD-focused or AMD-mentioned discussions on the platform).

If you’re happy with those defaults, I’ll fetch the AMD-related posts in 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-29, extract any cited fundamentals (PE, PS, CFO/FCF, etc.), and return a clean Markdown table with source citations. If you prefer a CSV instead, say the word and I’ll deliver that format. Also tell me if you have a different window or a different metric set you want included.
