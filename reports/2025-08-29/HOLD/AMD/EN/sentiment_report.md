# Sentiment Report

I’m running into an issue pulling the latest AMD news via the OpenAI news API right now. The tool is returning an internal AttributeError (ResponseFunctionWebSearch object has no attribute 'content'), and repeated attempts have failed. I can retry automatically in a few minutes, or you can trigger another fetch later.

In the meantime, I can help by outlining and starting on the analysis framework for a comprehensive AMD sentiment/news report. This will give you a clear, trader-focused deliverable once the data fetch works again, and it also provides a usable structure you can reference immediately.

What I will deliver once data is available (and how I’ll structure it)
- Executive summary
  - A concise view of sentiment trajectory over the past week, any major catalysts, and implications for AMD’s near-term risk/reward.

- Daily sentiment breakdown (past 7 days)
  - For each day: average sentiment score, volume of mentions, top themes/keywords, and any notable outliers or events.
  - Platform mix (X/Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, forums, news portals) and relative sentiment by platform.

- Public sentiment vs. price/action correlation
  - Snapshot of notable sentiment shifts relative to AMD price moves, with potential lag analysis (e.g., sentiment peak preceding price swing by 0–2 days).

- Major catalysts and their implications
  - Product announcements, earnings clues, supply chain news, AI/compute demand anecdotes, competitor context.
  - Likelihood and potential impact on momentum, margins, and valuation.

- Risk and opportunity assessment for traders
  - Short-term catalysts that could drive volatility (earnings timing, product launch windows, supply constraints).
  - Scenarios for bullish/bearish outcomes with trigger levels.

- Sentiment-driven trade ideas (if supported by data)
  - Potential ideas like risk-on/off overlays, options positioning cues (if sentiment data implies event-driven moves), or hedging considerations.

- Market context and microstructure considerations
  - Semiconductors/AI demand cycle, supplier updates, capital expenditure trends, supply/demand imbalances, and macro tailwinds/headwinds.

- Key takeaways and watchlist
  - 3–5 bullet points summarizing the most important near-term indicators and list of headlines to monitor.

Proposed Markdown table (end of report)
- I will append a structured Markdown table like this (you’ll fill with the actual data once the fetch works):
- Columns: Date, Platform, Headline/Topic, Sentiment (score), Mentions, News vs. Price Indicator, Catalysts, Notes
- Example row (placeholder): 2025-08-29 | Twitter | “AMD announces…”, -0.15 | 1,230 | Neutral, minor pullback | Product cadence concerns | Monitor for follow-up momentum

Would you like me to:
1) Retry fetching AMD news now (I’ll attempt again and then proceed with the full report as soon as the data comes through), or
2) Proceed with the framework and the Markdown table structure now, so you have a ready-to-fill report format while we wait for the data?

If you prefer, I can also provide a more concise executive snapshot template now (no data) to share immediately, and then populate the detailed sections once the news pull succeeds.
