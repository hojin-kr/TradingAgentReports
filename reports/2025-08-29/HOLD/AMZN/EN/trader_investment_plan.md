# Trader Investment Plan

Recommendation: Hold AMZN for now.

Why this stance fits:
- Near-term setup remains choppy: price is not yet above key short-term moving averages (below the 50-SMA and 10-EMA) with the VWMA still above price, implying distribution pressure and potential for continued choppiness.
- Long-term thesis intact: AWS, AI-related monetization, ads, and Prime monetization offer durable growth and margin expansion over 12â€“24 months.
- Breakout needed for conviction: a clean, volume-backed reclaim of the 50-SMA around 223.99 with the VWMA above price (~227.40) and positive momentum would tilt the odds toward an up-leg. Until that confirmation occurs, risk-reward favors patience.

Key levels to watch (as per the plan):
- Entry triggers to consider for new longs: daily close above 223.99 with volume above VWMA (~227.40), MACD turning positive or widening, RSI moving higher from ~50 toward 60+.
- Stop for risk control: around 212.82 (200-SMA) or the prior swing low for tighter risk control.
- Initial upside targets if breakout sustains: VWMA at ~227.40, then potential moves into the low-to-mid 230s; monitor for momentum confirmation.

Action guidance:
- For current holders: maintain a cautious stance. Consider tightening risk or trimming exposure on rallies that fail to clear the 50-SMA with volume. Maintain a stop near 212.82.
- For new allocations: wait for a disciplined breakout signal above 223.99 with confirming volume and momentum before entering; use a staged entry approach and apply a clear stop.

Risk considerations:
- Near-term volatility from AI capex timing, regulatory headwinds, and macro shifts could pressure near-term earnings power and multiple expansion.

Bottom line: Hold now. Ready to add on a confirmed breakout above 223.99 with solid volume and momentum; otherwise, wait for clearer bullish confirmation.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
