# Fundamentals Report

Thanks. I can proceed as soon as you confirm the defaults. Here are my recommended choices (you can adjust):

Recommended defaults
- Date window: July 29, 2025 → August 29, 2025 (inclusive)
  - Why: captures the most recent 1-month period ending today (2025-08-29).
- Data source: Fundamental (the site/app that shows PE, PS, cash flow, etc.)
  - If you’d prefer a different site (e.g., Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance discussions, etc.), tell me and I’ll switch.
- Table output: Consolidated snapshot (averages/medians) across all posts in the window
  - This yields a single, easy-to-read summary. If you prefer one row per post, I can switch to that instead.

If you’re happy with these defaults, please confirm. If you want different choices, specify:
- Start date and end date (in yyyy-mm-dd format)
- Data source (name or link)
- Table format preference (consolidated vs. one row per post)

Once confirmed, I’ll run the data pull for PLTR and generate the full report with a Markdown table at the end.
