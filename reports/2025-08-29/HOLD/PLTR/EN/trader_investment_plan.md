# Trader Investment Plan

Summary: Based on the foundation provided and the current near-term signals, the recommended stance is to Hold PLTR today. The long-term story remains intact, but momentum confirmation is lacking right now, so I’m not comfortable initiating or increasing exposure until additional signals confirm.

What this implies right now
- Stance: Hold (no new buying today). Upgrade to Buy only on a clear momentum breakout with volume support.
- Why holding makes sense now:
  - Near-term momentum markers are weak: MACD is negative, RSI around 44, and the price is trading with VWMA above it, indicating volume-led upside hasn’t materialized.
  - Price hasn’t reclaimed key levels yet (e.g., 10-EMA around 161) with sustained volume, so risk-reward favors patience.
  - The bull case remains intact over the longer horizon (Foundry expansion, Gotham backlog, governance moat), but those catalysts don’t guarantee a near-term move without confirming momentum.
- What would flip to Buy (upgrade triggers):
  - Price closes above and sustains above the 10-EMA (~161) with a close above VWMA (~162) and a clear MACD cross (supported by a second momentum signal) plus RSI trending toward 50–55.
  - Price holds above VWMA for 2–3 sessions and tests the 165–170 zone with sustained volume.
  - ARR/backlog signals show accelerating demand and margin visibility supporting a fresh upside bias.
- Action plan if/when upgrade triggers:
  - Enter gradually: start with a smaller tranche on the initial bullish close above 161–162 with volume confirmation; add into strength toward 170–180 only if momentum remains intact.
  - Risk controls: limit new exposure to 2–3% of portfolio initially; use ATR-based stops (around 1.5–2x ATR; current ATR ~7.5) or mental stops near 150–152 if a break below major support occurs with high volume.
  - Profit management: consider trimming or tightening stops near 165–170 if momentum falters (MACD or RSI stops advancing) to protect gains.
- What I’ll monitor over the next weeks:
  - A clean breakout above 161 with volume, corroborated by multiple momentum measures.
  - ARR/backlog signals and profitability trajectory to ensure the long-term thesis remains supported as momentum shifts.

Alignment with the provided plan
- I’m treating the Hold as the prudent stance given the near-term momentum uncertainties outlined in the plan.
- I’ll only upgrade to Buy on explicit, multi-indicator confirmation (price, volume, and momentum) and credible backlog/ARR signals improving.
- The plan’s emphasis on multi-factor confirmation, risk controls, and staged entry is sound; I’ll apply those same criteria here.
