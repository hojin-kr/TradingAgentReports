# Sentiment Report

Thanks! I can proceed, but I need a few confirmations to fetch the right data and structure the report.

Proposed defaults (please confirm or adjust):
- Date window: 2025-08-22 through 2025-08-29 (inclusive)
- Platforms: public posts from X (formerly Twitter), Reddit (e.g., r/TSLA, r/investing), and StockTwits
  - Exclude: Facebook public posts, TikTok, Instagram, etc., unless you want them included
- Output format: a summarized digest (daily sentiment, top topics, and notable drivers) plus a handful of representative posts with links
  - Also provide a detailed forward-looking implications section for traders
- Language: English only (non-English content can be included if desired)
- Constraints:
  - Include posts that explicitly mention TSLA (ticker: TSLA or $TSLA) or “Tesla”
  - Exclude posts that only mention the company in passing (prefer posts with substantive content or sentiment)
- Report structure: I’ll deliver a long-form analysis with actionable insights, followed by a Markdown table summarizing key points at the end
- Cadence: If you’d like, I can also provide a quick executive snapshot (1-page) in addition to the full report

If these look good, I’ll pull the data for TSLA from 2025-08-22 to 2025-08-29 and deliver:
- A detailed sentiment/demand analyst view by day
- Key themes (e.g., price action implications, product/tech mentions, leadership commentary)
- Notable posts with citations
- Trader-focused implications and risk flags
- A final Markdown table organizing the key takeaways

Would you like me to proceed with these defaults, or would you prefer any changes?
