Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock news for AAPL on 2025-09-16, but the Reddit data tool is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError. I can retry, or switch to a best-effort analysis using other signals. Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here’s a concrete plan and a ready-to-fill long-form report framework so we can proceed quickly once data access is restored.

Option A (recommended if you want fastest turnaround once data is back)
- I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then deliver a full, data-driven long report with:
  - Day-by-day sentiment analysis (past week)
  - Post volume trends
  - Thematically categorized social content (e.g., product news, services momentum, AI features, supply chain, regulatory concerns)
  - Key Reddit threads and influencer signals
  - Correlation with price/volume action
  - Latest company news snapshot (earnings, product launches, guidance, regulatory moves)
  - Trader-focused implications and risk flags
  - A compact summary table (Makrdown) of actionable takeaways

Option B (if you want to proceed now without Reddit data)
- I’ll produce a comprehensive long report framework using qualitative signals and any non-Reddit sources you’re comfortable I include (e.g., public sentiment summaries, general news coverage, macro context). I’ll clearly mark data gaps and provide actionable inferences that are robust even without Reddit specifics.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option B immediately and deliver a thorough framework and a first-pass narrative, with placeholders where Reddit data would normally go. Here’s the structure I’ll follow, plus what I’ll fill in once data comes back.

Proposed long-form report structure (to be filled with data)
- Executive snapshot
  - One-paragraph summary of current sentiment direction (positive/neutral/negative) and main drivers
  - Short-term price action context and notable catalysts anticipated next week
- Data and signals overview (past 7 days)
  - Social sentiment: overall tone, daily sentiment scores, notable spikes
  - Social engagement: post volume, unique authors, engagement rate
  - Thematic distribution: top themes driving sentiment (e.g., iPhone cycle, services growth, AI features, supply chain, regulatory concerns)
  - News backdrop: major company/news events in the period (earnings, product updates, regulatory items)
- Daily sentiment ledger (last 7 days)
  - Date, sentiment score, post volume, top themes, notable posts/influencers
  - Observed pattern: e.g., mid-week spike around a potential product update, weekend chatter on services
- Thematic deep-dive
  - Positive drivers: what is driving optimistic sentiment (e.g., services growth, improving margins, AI ecosystem traction)
  - Negative/dramatic drivers: what is triggering risk-off sentiment (e.g., supply chain concerns, regulatory scrutiny, competition)
  - Friction points: any recurring concerns (execution risk, hardware demand, pricing strategy)
- News and company fundamentals (latest 1–2 weeks)
  - Key headlines and their market interpretation
  - Any guidance updates, product launches, or strategic shifts
- Price/volatility context
  - How sentiment trends have historically correlated with AAPL price and implied volatility
  - Short-term risks to monitor
- Trader takeaways and scenarios
  - If sentiment improves/weaker: potential price targets and risk controls
  - If major negative catalyst emerges: hedging ideas and stop-management tips
- Data gaps and next steps
  - Note missing Reddit data and any other data limitations
  - Recommendations for data refresh cadence

What I’ll deliver at the end (Makrdown table)
- A concise, easy-to-scan table organizing key points, signals, and implications for traders

Draft Makrdown table (to be finalized once data is in)
- Section | Data Source | Key Observables | Potential Implications for Traders
- Social Sentiment | Reddit, X/Twitter, Stock forums | Daily sentiment score, post volume, top themes | Signal strength and timing for entry/exit; watch for divergence from price
- News Coverage | Company press releases, major outlets | Major headlines, guidance shifts, product updates | Catalyst risk/opportunity timing
- Price Action | intraday data, options flow | Price trend, volume, IV surface, skew | Confirm/contradict sentiment signals; adjust position sizing
- Thematic Drivers | NLP theme extraction | Dominant themes (services, devices, AI, supply chain) | Focus areas for due diligence and risk assessment
- Risk Signals | Regulatory, geopolitical, supply chain | New risks or escalations | Hedge or reduce exposure if risk signals strengthen
- Takeaways | Synthesis across sources | Net directional stance, confidence level | Actionable posture: BUY/HOLD/SELL (to be decided once data is complete)

Next steps
- Please tell me which option you prefer:
  - Retry data fetch now (Option A)
  - Proceed with Option B (best-effort framework with data gaps clearly marked)
- If you have any additional data sources you want included (e.g., StockTwits, Bloomberg headlines, CNBC snippets), tell me and I’ll incorporate them.

Once you confirm, I’ll proceed accordingly and deliver the completed long-form report with the final Makrdown table.
