I ran into a data retrieval issue pulling live AAPL data in this environment (FileNotFoundError). I can’t compute the exact indicator values right now, but I can still lay out a solid, complementary 8-indicator setup and explain how they would be used once the data is available. If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data or proceed with a qualitative, rules-based guide using these indicators in the meantime.

Recommended 8 indicators for AAPL (diverse, complementary insights)
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (Long-term trend)
  - Rationale: Establishes the long-term trend direction. Price above the 200 SMA suggests a bullish backdrop; price below suggests bearish tendencies. Useful for strategic bias and major trend confirmation.
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (Mid-term trend)
  - Rationale: Tracks the intermediate trend and often serves as dynamic support/resistance. Crosses with the 200 SMA (golden/death cross concept) can refine timing for entries/exits.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages (Short-term momentum)
  - Rationale: Captures quick momentum shifts and potential entry points. More responsive than the SMAs, but also more prone to noise; helps with timely signals when used with longer-term filters.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related (Momentum)
  - Rationale: Core momentum measure. Crossovers of MACD with its signal line can signal trend changes; useful when combined with price action and other trend indicators.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related (Momentum signal)
  - Rationale: The MACD signal line (smoother) cross provides a filtered view on momentum changes, helping reduce false positives from MACD alone.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related (Momentum strength)
  - Rationale: Histogram shows the gap between MACD and its signal, highlighting momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than price moves. Adds nuance to momentum assessment.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Rationale: Measures relative momentum and helps spot overbought/oversold conditions. Use with trend context (e.g., RSI overbought in an uptrend may still be bullish if trend filters align) to anticipate reversals or continuations.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Rationale: Averages true range to quantify volatility. Important for setting stop-loss levels and sizing positions; higher ATR implies wider stops and larger day-to-day price swings to account for.

Why these are suitable together for AAPL
- They cover a broad spectrum: long-term trend (200 SMA), mid-term trend (50 SMA), immediate momentum (10 EMA, MACD suite, RSI), and risk management (ATR).
- They provide non-redundant signals: trend direction and crossovers (200/50 SMA, EMA), momentum confirmation (MACD trio and RSI), and volatility/risk controls (ATR). This combination helps reduce false signals that can occur if you over-rely on a single indicator.
- For a stock like AAPL, which often exhibits clear trend phases punctuated by volatility spikes, this mix helps you identify sustained movements as well as quick momentum shifts while maintaining prudent risk controls.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the raw data (AAPL from Yahoo Finance) and compute these indicators exactly as requested. If you’re able to retry or provide permission to try again, I’ll produce a detailed trend and signal report with the actual values.
- Alternatively, if you want to proceed immediately without live data, I can provide a rules-based trading outline using these indicators and show example entry/exit criteria. When you want, I’ll plug in real values and give you a full, data-backed analysis.

Table: Key indicators, purpose, and how to interpret for AAPL
| Indicator | Category | Purpose / What it tells you | How to use in AAPL context |
|---------|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages (Long-term) | Long-term trend direction; dynamic bias. | If price > 200 SMA, bias is bullish; if price < 200 SMA, bias is bearish. Use as macro filter for entries. |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages (Mid-term) | Mid-term trend; dynamic support/resistance. | Price above 50 SMA suggests mid-term uptrend; 50/200 cross can signal trend change; use for timing with other signals. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages (Short-term) | Quick momentum shifts; timely signals. | Use for near-term entries when aligned with longer-term trend; beware of noise in choppy markets. |
| macd | MACD Related (Momentum) | Core momentum; potential trend-change signals. | Look for MACD line crossing above/below the signal line; confirm with price action and other indicators. |
| macds | MACD Related (Momentum signal) | Smoothed momentum signal; reduces false positives. | Use crossovers with MACD line as confirmation of momentum turn. |
| macdh | MACD Related (Momentum strength) | Momentum strength; early divergence cues. | Rising histogram indicates strengthening momentum; negative or shrinking histogram suggests weakening momentum. Check for divergences with price. |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold cues. | RSI > 70 overbought, < 30 oversold; in uptrends, use with trend to avoid premature exits; watch for bearish/bullish divergences. |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility; risk management and position sizing. | Higher ATR implies wider price swings; adjust stops and sizing; use to gauge stop distance behind the current volatility regime. |

If you want me to retry data retrieval now, say “retry data fetch for AAPL” and I’ll attempt again and then deliver a full, data-backed indicator report with nuanced trend insights.
