I attempted to fetch the required data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin balance sheet/income statement/cash flow for AAPL) but the tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError in the current environment. It looks like the data sources or paths aren’t accessible right now, so I don’t have the latest figures to include in the report.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval immediately to see if the environment stabilizes.
- If you have alternate data access (different API keys or a different data source), I can switch to that and produce the full report.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with a rigorous fundamentals framework for AAPL using publicly known information up to today, and clearly mark where data is needed for precise numerical filling.

Proposed plan (once data is retrievable)
1) Company profile and context
   - Business model, segments, markets, competitive positioning, catalyst drivers over the past week.
2) Financial statements (quarterly and year-over-year where available)
   - Income Statement: revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, margins, EPS.
   - Balance Sheet: assets, liabilities, equity, key liquidity items (cash, short-term investments, debt).
   - Cash Flow: operating, investing, financing cash flows; free cash flow where relevant.
   - Trend analysis: quarterly trajectory, seasonality, margin compression/expansion, cash conversion cycle.
3) Key financial ratios and history
   - Liquidity: current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio.
   - Leverage: debt-to-equity, interest coverage.
   - Profitability: gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROA, ROE.
   - Efficiency: asset turnover, operating cash flow yield.
4) Insider data
   - Insider sentiment (past 15 days): overall tone (positive/neutral/negative) and notable drivers.
   - Insider transactions (past 15 days): aggregate buying/selling, notable insiders, size of trades, potential implications.
5) Macro and micro factors
   - Recent product cycles, supply chain dynamics, regulatory/compliance/regulatory risk signals, AI/semiconductor cycle sensitivities, macro backdrop (rates, FX, consumer demand signals).
6) Trader-oriented conclusions
   - What the fundamental strengths/risks mean for near-term price action.
   - Potential scenarios and key data points that would alter the view.
   - Specific risks to monitor in the coming days (earnings cadence, guidance shifts, supply chain news).

Appendix: Markdown table for key points (to be filled with actual data when retrieved)
- I will append a concise Markdown table at the end with:
  - Item (e.g., Revenue Q2 2025)
  - Source (SimFin / Finnhub)
  - Frequency (quarterly / annual)
  - Current value
  - YoY/ QoQ change
  - Interpretation for traders

Next step
Would you like me to retry pulling the data now to complete the full, detailed report? If you have an alternative data source or API access, share the details and I’ll adapt. If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-light fundamentals framework for AAPL in the meantime and clearly indicate where numerical figures will be plugged in once the data is available.
