Sorry — the Reddit data fetch for NFLX on 2025-09-16 failed due to a tool error (FileNotFoundError). I attempted twice and the tool isn’t returning data at the moment.

Here are two ways we can proceed:

Option A: Retry and fetch data now
- I can attempt the Reddit stock activity feed again (and ideally also pull related social/news data if the tool supports it) to generate the full, data-backed report with day-by-day sentiment, key posts, and notable threads.

Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, data-light framework now
- I can deliver a comprehensive NFLX analysis focused on trading implications, structure, and methodology, but without the live Reddit sentiment numbers. It will cover:
  - What traders typically watch for NFLX (subscriber trends, ARPU, pricing/tiers, content slate, profitability, ad-supported mix, international growth).
  - How to interpret sentiment signals once data is available (how to map Reddit/X/Twitter commentary to potential price moves, typical sentiment-to-price translation, risk flags).
  - A robust reporting framework you can reuse each week (sections, metrics to track, how to summarize daily sentiment and news).
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference.

If you’d like, I can start with Option B right away and provide a thorough, trader-focused long report with placeholders where sentiment data would go, so you can drop in the actual numbers as soon as the tool is back. Then I can fill in the exact sentiment readings and news items once the data fetch works.

Please tell me which option you prefer, or if you’d like me to try the Reddit data fetch again now.
