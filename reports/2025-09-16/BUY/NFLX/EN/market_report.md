I tried to fetch NFLX data but I’m hitting an internal data service error right now:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

This prevents me from generating a real-time indicator-driven report for NFLX at the moment. I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with a robust indicator plan and be ready to run the full analysis as soon as the data pull succeeds. Here’s how I’ll proceed once data is available, and what I’ll deliver in the meantime.

Most relevant indicators I will use (up to 8, non-redundant, complementary)

- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance in the mid-term.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend confirmation and potential golden/death cross context.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Quick momentum shifts; helps identify shorter-term entry signals when used with longer-term averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum shifts and potential trend changes through crossovers/divergence.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoother confirmation line; use crossovers with MACD for trade signals.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index. Momentum gauge; watch for overbought/oversold levels and potential divergences.
- atr: Average True Range. Measures volatility; useful for setting stops and sizing risk relative to current volatility.
- vwma: Volume-Weighted Moving Average. Confirms price moves with volume; helps validate breakouts or reversals when price aligns with volume flow.

Why these are suitable for NFLX in a typical market context
- NFLX often exhibits mid- to long-term trend components that can be captured by 50/200 SMAs, with the 10 EMA providing sensitivity to short-term shifts. This helps separate durable trend from noisy price action.
- MACD and its signal line give a robust view of momentum changes and can help catch trend re-accelerations or decelerations, especially around earnings or guidance events.
- RSI adds a momentum perspective to potential reversals, particularly when price action is grinding near support/resistance zones or during trending conditions where RSI can remain in overbought/oversold territory for extended periods.
- ATR provides a practical read on volatility, important for NFLX given episodic volatility around earnings and product-cycle news; it also guides risk management.
- VWMA gives volume-informed confirmation, which is valuable for NFLX where volume spikes can accompany important news or large moves, helping distinguish genuine moves from low-volume noise.

What you can expect in the full report once data is available
- A trend alignment assessment: Where NFLX sits relative to 50/200 SMA, and how the 10 EMA interacts with them to gauge momentum vs. trend.
- Momentum analysis: MACD/macd_s crossovers and divergences, RSI level checks, and potential confirmations with price action.
- Volatility and risk: ATR-based observations and suggested stop levels, plus how volatility is evolving with current price action.
- Volume-backed validation: VWMA cross-checks for breakout validity or trend continuation, especially around key price levels or earnings dates.
- Actionable takeaways: Potential entry/exit zones framed by trend, momentum, volatility, and volume, with caveats about earnings risk and market regime.

Next steps
- I can retry the NFLX data fetch now and then generate the full 8-indicator report with the detailed trend analysis.
- If you’d prefer, I can proceed with the indicator framework now and populate the narrative as soon as the data pull succeeds, so you get a ready-to-use decision framework immediately after data is available.

If you’d like me to retry now, say “Retry data fetch for NFLX,” and I’ll attempt again and then deliver the full, detailed report as soon as the data is retrieved.
