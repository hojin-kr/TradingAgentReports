I hit a snag with the data tools: the attempts to pull insider sentiment/transactions and quarterly financials were rejected with a FileNotFoundError. Also, QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) rather than a single company, so the insider sentiment/transactions endpoints (designed for individual companies) aren’t applicable to QQQ. The SimFin endpoints may also expect a corporate ticker and might not return ETF fundamentals.

What I can do next
- ETF-focused fundamentals (high level): I can assemble a comprehensive ETF profile for QQQ, including fund purpose, index methodology, expense ratio, AUM, liquidity/float, and tracking considerations. I can discuss top holdings qualitatively (concentration, sector exposure) and how those traits influence risk/return.
- Underlying company approach: If you’d prefer granular fundamentals, I can switch to analyzing a specific underlying company within QQQ (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, META). I can fetch quarterly financials (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) for that company and provide a detailed view.
- Hybrid approach: I can provide an ETF-centric analysis now and, upon your confirmation, drill into one or more top holdings with company-level fundamentals.

Recommended next step
- Tell me which path you want:
  1) Full ETF fundamentals for QQQ (qualitative + holdings outline)
  2) Analyze a specific underlying company within QQQ (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, META)
  3) A general ETF analysis with publicly known metrics if you’d like me to fetch holdings data and summarize

If you’re unsure, I can start with a high-level ETF profile and a holdings-focused view (top 6 holdings, sector concentration, and proxy risk factors) and then go deeper into any specific holding on request.

Proposed concise ETF-focused outline (to be populated once you confirm the path)
- Fund profile: issuer, inception date, fund type, tracking index, rebalancing cadence
- Core metrics: expense ratio, AUM, average daily volume, bid-ask spread, tracking error
- Index methodology: how the Nasdaq-100 is constructed and rebalanced
- Holdings overview: top holdings and approximate concentration, sector weights
- Risk factors: sector/tech concentration risk, exposure to large-cap names, liquidity risk
- Performance context: proxy for recent performance vs. benchmark (qualitative if numeric data unavailable)
- Insider information: not applicable to ETFs (explain why)
- Data gaps and next steps: what data I’ll pull if you approve the underlying-company path
