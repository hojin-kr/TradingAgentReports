Recommendation: Buy with staged exposure and risk controls, using hedges to limit downside.

What I’m doing based on the plan:
- Target exposure: 8% of the equity sleeve allocated to QQQ (adjustable to your size; use 6–10% as the flexible range).
- Tranche approach (fixed allocation for clarity):
  - Tranche 1 now: 30% of the target exposure (example: if target is 8%, allocate 2.4% of the portfolio to QQQ today). Entry around pullback/support confluence (near 50-day/ VWAP) using limit orders.
  - Tranche 2 on confirmation: 40% of the target exposure (3.2% of portfolio) if price action shows a decisive breakout on volume with positive MACD and RSI in a healthy range, price above key moving averages.
  - Tranche 3 on strength: 30% of the target exposure (2.4% of portfolio) if trend accelerates (new highs, breadth expansion, solid AI/cloud guidance).
- Hedging: implement a collar to limit downside while preserving upside.
  - Buy a modest OTM protective put against QQQ for downside protection.
  - Finance the put by selling a slightly ITM/ATM call (or an overlapping short-dated call) to offset cost. Adjust strikes/dates to fit your risk budget.
- Risk controls:
  - ATR-based stops: place initial stop at roughly 1.5x current ATR below entry for each tranche; adjust as price moves.
  - Position sizing: cap each tranche so worst-case drawdown from that tranche is a small fixed % of the portfolio (e.g., 1–2% per tranche).
- Monitoring and kill switches:
  - Regime checks: if real yields rise materially, breadth narrows, or inflation surprises persist, reassess progress and consider trimming or reducing new buys.
  - Exit rule: if QQQ closes below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages with MACD negative and deteriorating breadth for a sustained period, reduce exposure by 50% or exit.
- Time horizon: 6–12 months (or longer if AI/cloud secular growth remains intact and regime stays favorable).
- Expectations: potential upside in line with durable AI/cloud demand and margin resilience; downside risk mitigated by hedges and staged entry.

Bottom line
- The strongest case supports a Buy stance with disciplined, staged entry and hedging. This structure aims to capture multi-quarter growth while limiting drawdowns from regime or rate shocks.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
