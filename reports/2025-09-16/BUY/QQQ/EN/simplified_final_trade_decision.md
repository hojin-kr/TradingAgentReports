## Executive Summary
Buy with disciplined risk controls and staged exposure to capture AI/cloud growth in large tech. Hedge to limit downside while preserving upside, over a 6–12 month horizon.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Buy (high confidence)

- Buy QQQ with staged exposure and risk controls designed to limit drawdowns while still aiming for upside over the next 6–12 months.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Exposure to durable AI/cloud leaders: QQQ tracks big tech names that benefit from ongoing AI and cloud demand, supporting solid revenue growth.
- Staged exposure reduces risk: invest in steps, confirming strength before adding more to limit sudden losses.
- Downside protection with hedging: a cost-efficient hedge helps guard against sharp declines while keeping meaningful upside.
- Time horizon fits the growth cycle: 6–12 months aligns with a durable AI/cloud growth phase that can re-rate valuations if conditions stay favorable.
- Flexible risk management: the plan includes clear kill-switches and data-gap safeguards to adapt to changing conditions.

## Risks To Watch
- Valuation and rate sensitivity: if interest rates stay higher or rise, stock multiples can shrink.
- Data gaps and execution risk: hedges cost money and may not fully protect during shocks.
- Concentration risk and breadth: heavy exposure to a few mega-cap tech names; exits could be slow in a downturn.
- Hedge costs and practicality: hedging is not free and may underperform in volatile markets.
- Regime shifts: changes in inflation, real yields, or market breadth can alter the outlook.
