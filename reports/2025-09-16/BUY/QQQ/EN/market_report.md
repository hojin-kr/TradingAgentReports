Thanks for the prompt. Quick status update: I attempted to fetch data for QQQ but the data-retrieval tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. I cannot generate a data-driven trend report right now. I can still move things forward by selecting a robust set of indicators and outlining how I would interpret them once data is available. If the data tool comes back online, I can run the exact analyses and provide a detailed, data-backed report.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators, non-redundant and complementary)
- close_50_sma
  - Rationale: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps confirm market regime (bullish/bearish) when price is above/below the 50 SMA.
- close_200_sma
  - Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark; useful to identify major regime shifts (golden cross/death cross) and to filter trades in alignment with the longer trend.
- close_10_ema
  - Rationale: Responsive short-term momentum; helps detect quick shifts in price action and potential entry/exit points when used with longer-term trends.
- macd
  - Rationale: Core momentum indicator; crossovers between MACD line and signal line indicate potential trend changes; useful in conjunction with trend checks from moving averages.
- macds
  - Rationale: MACD signal line; its crossovers with MACD provide additional confirmation for entries/exits and help reduce false signals in drifting markets.
- rsi
  - Rationale: Momentum oscillator signaling overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; beneficial when used with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- atr
  - Rationale: Volatility gauge; informs risk management (position sizing and stop placement) and helps gauge current volatility regime for adjusting trade expectations.
- vwma
  - Rationale: Volume-weighted trend confirmation; integrates price action with volume, helping validate moves when price actions align with volume-supported momentum.

Rationale for this selection in the context of QQQ
- QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) is tech-heavy and tends to exhibit pronounced trend and volatility cycles, especially around earnings and macro tech-related news. The chosen set aims to:
  - Confirm trend direction and durability (50/200 SMA, plus 10 EMA for short-term momentum context).
  - Capture momentum shifts with MACD family signals and RSI for overbought/oversold nuance.
  - Manage risk by accounting for volatility (ATR) and validating moves with volume (VWMA).
  - Avoid redundancy by not overlapping with multiple oscillators that provide the same kind of signal (e.g., skipping Stochastic RSI here to keep focus on these core indicators).

What I would deliver once data is available (detailed, nuanced report)
- Top-level trend assessment: alignment across 50/200 SMA, and current price relative to these levels; note any recent golden/death cross signals and their timing.
- Momentum context: MACD crossovers, MACD histogram strength (if shown), and RSI position relative to 50/70/30 thresholds; identify divergences with price.
- Volatility and risk: ATR level relative to recent history; implications for stop placement and position sizing.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA direction and how it aligns with price moves; deviations could indicate potential false breakouts.
- Trade setup patterns: describe likely long/short entry scenarios given the current alignment of indicators, with examples like “price above 50/200 SMA, MACD bullish crossover, RSI rising but not overbought, ATR expanding, VWMA confirming volume.”
- Caveats and filters: discuss regimes where signals might produce false positives (e.g., in choppy markets where RSI remains overbought/oversold for extended periods; high ATR spikes without sustained follow-through).
- Risk management notes: propose baseline stop distances using ATR, suggested risk per trade, and how to adjust sizing during high-volatility periods.

Next steps
- I will re-run data retrieval and the indicator calculations as soon as the data tool is available again.
- If you prefer, you can provide a data snippet (CSV) for QQQ covering the desired window, and I’ll generate the indicators and the full trend report immediately.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with a qualitative, hypothesis-driven analysis for QQQ based on typical behavior with these indicators, but the insights won’t be tied to fresh data.

Key points at a glance (table)
- Indicator set: close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macds, rsi, atr, vwma
- What it measures: trend (50/200 SMA), short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD), momentum strength/divergence (RSI, MACD), volatility (ATR), volume support (VWMA)
- How it helps a QQQ trader: combines trend direction, momentum signals, volatility, and volume to form a balanced view and reduce false signals in a tech-heavy asset
- Caveat: relies on up-to-date price data; I cannot finalize the report until data retrieval is functioning

If you want, I can also prepare a separate, ready-to-run template you can reuse as soon as the data tool is back online. Just say the word, and I’ll tailor the report format and interpretation guidelines to your preferred trading framework (e.g., swing, intraday, or position trading).
