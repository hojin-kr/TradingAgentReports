I attempted to fetch NVDA data via the Yahoo Finance data tool, but the data retrieval failed with a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like an environment or data-path issue on the data source side. I can retry shortly, or proceed with a qualitative plan and wait for data to be available. Let me know if you’d prefer I retry now or move ahead with a best-effort qualitative view in the meantime.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators total) with rationale for NVDA
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark (200-day simple moving average).
  - Why relevant: Helps confirm the dominant trend direction over a broad horizon, useful for NVDA given multi-quarter AI-cycle moves.
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Intermediate-term trend (50-day simple moving average).
  - Why relevant: Provides a smoother, shorter-term trend signal than 200 SMA to help filter entries in a high-volatility stock.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum via a fast exponential moving average.
  - Why relevant: Captures quick shifts in NVDA’s momentum, useful for timely entries/exits when price action is dynamic.
- macd (MACD Related)
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; MACD line.
  - Why relevant: Classic momentum signal; crossovers help identify trend changes in a stock with big swings like NVDA.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: The MACD signal line (EMA of MACD).
  - Why relevant: Crossovers with MACD provide confirmatory triggers and reduce false signals.
- rsi (Momentum Indicators)
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index (momentum, overbought/oversold).
  - Why relevant: Helps spot potential reversals or pullbacks when NVDA is extended; watch for divergences in strong uptrends.
- atr (Volatility Indicators)
  - What it measures: Average True Range; current volatility level.
  - Why relevant: Critical for risk management and position sizing in NVDA given its volatility environment; informs stop placement.
- vwma (Volume-Based Indicators)
  - What it measures: Volume-weighted moving average.
  - Why relevant: Validates price moves with volume; helps distinguish genuine trend moves from price noise, especially around AI-cycle catalysts.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report describing:
  - The current alignment of the 200 SMA, 50 SMA, and 10 EMA to define trend and momentum.
  - MACD and MACD Signal crossovers and histogram interpretations for momentum changes.
  - RSI readings and potential divergences to flag reversals or continuation conditions.
  - ATR-driven volatility context and how it impacts risk management (stops, position sizing).
  - VWMA signals to confirm price moves with volume, reducing false entries in high-volatility regimes.
  - An integrated view with practical trading implications (entry/exit ideas, risk controls).

Next steps
- Option A: I retry data retrieval now and then run the 8-indicator suite, followed by the full report plus a Markdown-table summary.
- Option B: If you prefer, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis of NVDA based on general market behavior and recent trends, but that would not be data-backed and may be less precise.

Markdown table: key points (indicator choices and purpose)
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | Why it’s relevant for NVDA |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark (200-day SMA) | Confirms dominant long-term direction in a high-growth stock with multi-quarter AI-cycle moves |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Intermediate-term trend (50-day SMA) | Filters trend signals for medium-term decisions in volatile price action |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum (10-day EMA) | Captures quick momentum shifts for timely entries/exits |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via MACD line | Classic momentum signal; helps identify trend changes |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD Signal line | Crossovers with MACD provide clearer entry/exit triggers |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold | Signals potential reversals; watch for divergences in strong trends |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility (range) | Guides risk management: stop placement and position sizing in volatile moves |
| vwma | Volume-Based Indicators | Volume-weighted price trend | Validates moves with volume to reduce false signals in choppy markets |

Note: I’ll proceed with the data-driven run as soon as the data tool issue is resolved. If you’d like me to retry immediately, say “Retry NVDA data” and I’ll attempt again right away. If you prefer, I can also switch to Option B and provide a qualitative NVDA view in the meantime.
