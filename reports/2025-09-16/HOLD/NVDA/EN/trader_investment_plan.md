Recommendation: Hold NVDA with hedges.

Rationale
- The bull case for NVDA remains intact over the long term due to AI infrastructure adoption, CUDA ecosystem moat, and backlog visibility. However, near-term headwinds exist, including valuation risk, regulatory/geopolitical exposure (China export controls), potential competitive pressure, and macro-volatility that can compress multiples or dampen data-center capex.
- A pure long-only stance carries meaningful downside risk if catalysts disappoint or if multiple re-pricing occurs. A hedged hold lets you maintain exposure to the secular AI cycle while limiting downside in a choppier environment.

Strategic actions
- Maintain or establish a hedged core position:
  - Collar or protective puts: buy puts ~5–15% below the current price for 6–12 months, funded partially by selling near-term OTM calls to offset costs.
  - If you already hold a position, a collar typically achieves downside protection with lower upfront cost than a straight put.
- Position sizing: keep NVDA as a core exposure but cap incremental risk in the portfolio. Avoid aggressive add-ons at current highs unless accompanied by a clear pullback or durable momentum.
- Entry/exit triggers:
  - Add selectively on controlled pullbacks to defined technical levels (e.g., around major moving averages or prior consolidation zones) rather than chasing highs.
  - If a negative catalyst hits (earnings miss, regulatory news, or softening backlog/forecast), use hedges to maintain downside protection and reassess risk/reward.
- Data-driven validation plan (when tools return): apply the 8-indicator framework (200 SMA, 50 SMA, 10 EMA, MACD, MACD signal, RSI, ATR, VWMA) to confirm a composite trend/momentum/volatility read rather than relying on a single signal.
- Scenario planning and rules:
  - Base: steady AI-driven growth with hedged core exposure.
  - Bear: material capex slowdown or regulatory/regime shifts; reduce risk via hedges and consider partial trims if catalysts persist.
  - Bull: backlog and spend accelerate; consider scaled acceleration with hedges to protect against pullbacks.

Learnings applied
- Don’t chase hype; rely on durable moat signals (CUDA ecosystem, backlog, cloud deals).
- Hedge consistently to cap downside in a high-multiple, high-volatility name.
- Define explicit triggers for switching from Hold to Buy or Hold to Sell; avoid relying on emotion or headlines alone.

Next steps if you want precision
- If you’d like, I can implement the hedge sizing and exact trigger levels now (collar composition, strike selection, and expiration dates) based on your risk tolerance and position size.
- I can also run the 8-indicator suite once data tools are available to provide a data-backed confirmation layer for future entries/exits.

Bottom line
NVDA remains a high-conviction exposure to a long-duration AI cycle, but current conditions justify a cautious, hedged stance rather than unhedged heavy buying. Hold with hedges to preserve upside while limiting downside risk.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
