I tried to fetch AMD data to generate a live, numbers-backed report, but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can retry the data fetch, or proceed with a detailed, qualitative, and indicator-based analysis you can act on right away. If you’d like, I’ll retry the data pull as soon as you confirm. In the meantime, here’s a robust plan: the most relevant indicators for AMD given a mixed market environment (mid-2024 through 2025) and a detailed, nuanced view you can use to inform trading decisions.

Indicator set I recommend (max 8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to confirm pullbacks within an uptrend or to flag trend changes when price closes below/above the 50 SMA.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; watch for golden/death cross setups against the current price trajectory. Strong signal when aligned with other indicators.
- macd: MACD line itself to gauge momentum shifts and potential trend changes. Crossovers with the MACD line provide actionable signals, especially when other filters are in place.
- macds: MACD Signal line. Crossover with the MACD line adds a second confirmation layer for entries/exits.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength and divergence awareness; helps visualize how quickly momentum is rising or fading.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum gauge for overbought/oversold conditions and possible divergences with price trends. Useful for spotting potential reversals when the trend is not extreme.
- atr: Average True Range. Volatility measure to guide risk management, stop placement, and position sizing relative to current volatility.
- vwma: Volume-Weighted Moving Average. Confirms trends by integrating price action with volume, helping distinguish price moves driven by heavy participation from those with light volume.

Why this set is suitable for AMD in this context
- AMD has significant sensitivity to both tech cycle momentum (AI/server/datacenter demand) and broader equity market risk sentiment. The combination of 50/200 SMA gives a clear sense of cadence between mid-term and long-term trends, while MACD components provide timely momentum checks without relying solely on price action.
- RSI adds a momentum check for potential reversals, but when used with the trend filters from moving averages, it’s less prone to false signals in strong trends.
- ATR and VWMA bring risk management and volume confirmation into the mix, helping you avoid overtrading in volatile periods and ensuring that moves have solid market participation behind them.

Nuanced trend framework you can apply once data is available
- Baseline bullish setup: Price trades above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, MACD above zero with a rising histogram (macdh increasing), MACD line crossing upward over the MACD signal (macds). RSI is in a constructive range (e.g., 50–70) and not showing extreme overbought conditions; ATR prints moderate levels indicating manageable volatility; VWMA rising in tandem with price confirms that volume supports the move.
  - Trade implication: Consider a staged long entry on a pullback that touches or slightly tests the 50 SMA with confluence of MACD momentum and VWMA support. Use ATR for stop placement (e.g., a multiple of ATR below the latest swing low) and adjust position size to reflect current volatility.

- Baseline bearish setup: Price trades below both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, MACD below zero with a negative histogram (macdh decreasing), MACD line crossing downward under the MACD signal (macds). RSI trending toward oversold but not yet extreme, or showing bearish divergence with new highs. ATR elevated or rising, signaling increased volatility; VWMA weak or declining relative to price.
  - Trade implication: Consider small to moderate short exposure or hedging if price resistance develops around the 50/200 SMA. Use a tight stop with ATR-based sizing and watch for a reversal signal (MACD cross or RSI oversold conditions resolving) before adding to shorts.

- Mixed/continuation scenarios: Price oscillates around the 50 SMA with price still above the 200 SMA, or vice versa, while MACD shows flattening momentum. RSI may show mild overbought/oversold readings that reverse with a trend-following signal. In these cases, volume confirmation (VWMA) becomes critical—if volume supports the move, the signal is more reliable; if volume dries up, exercise caution and await a clearer trigger.

What I will deliver once the data fetch succeeds
- A precise, data-backed readout of AMD’s trend, including:
  - The latest values for 50 SMA, 200 SMA, MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram, RSI, ATR, and VWMA.
  - Clear trading signals (entry/exit/stop levels) based on the eight-indicator framework above.
  - A market-context narrative that ties AMD’s price action to AI/server demand, competitive positioning, and macro risk factors.
  - Potential scenarios with risk management notes and a suggested watchlist of days to watch for a breakout/breakdown.

Markdown table: key points and signals
- Indicator | Readout/Signal to Watch | Trade Implication
- close_50_sma | Price above/below the 50 SMA; direction relative to 50 SMA | Confirms or questions mid-term trend; use for pullback entries or trend checks
- close_200_sma | Price above/below the 200 SMA; cross of 50 above/below 200 | Long-term trend alignment; golden/death cross significance
- macd | MACD line vs. MACD zero line; magnitude of macdh | Momentum strength/direction; potential entry/exit with corroboration
- macds | MACD Signal line crossing MACD line | Early confirmation of momentum shifts
- macdh | Histogram size and direction | Momentum strength; watch for divergence with price
- rsi | RSI level and changes; divergence signals | Overbought/oversold context; potential reversals when aligned with trend
- atr | Current ATR value and recent changes | Volatility regime; informs stop and sizing
- vwma | VWMA trend in relation to price | Volume-confirmed moves; validates price action

Next steps
- I’ll retry the data fetch for AMD (AMD, 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-16) as soon as possible and then generate a fully data-backed, detailed report that aligns with the indicator set above.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with an immediate qualitative analysis using the framework above right now, without live numbers, and then replace placeholders with exact readings once the data pull succeeds.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with the qualitative, framework-based analysis in the meantime?
