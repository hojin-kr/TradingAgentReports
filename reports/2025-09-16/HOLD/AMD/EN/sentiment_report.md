Thanks for the follow-up. I hit an issue pulling the Reddit data you asked for:

- The Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all AMD date-range requests (2025-09-10 through 2025-09-16), including the specific 2025-09-16 request. I can’t retrieve the daily sentiment and top posts from Reddit right now.

What you can do next (your call):

- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (or at a specific date) and then generate the full, day-by-day social sentiment report with a detailed trader-oriented analysis.
- Option B: I proceed with a structured frame using placeholders and fill in the Reddit data once the tool is available, so you still get the complete report outline and the actionable insights you’d expect.
- Option C: If you have any Reddit summaries or screenshots you can paste, I can ingest those and accelerate the analysis.

What I can deliver now (as a framework) if we can’t fetch the Reddit data immediately:

- A comprehensive long-form AMD social sentiment and news report skeleton that you can fill in with the data when available.
- Trader-oriented insights, risk factors, and potential strategies aligned to AMD’s current state (based on typical catalysts in AI/compute hardware, data center demand, and competitive positioning) with explicit placeholders for sentiment metrics.

Proposed report structure (to be populated once Reddit data is available)

- Executive snapshot (one-pager)
  - Summary of sentiment trend across the week
  - Key drivers (news catalysts, product/stack announcements, industry shifts)
  - Net sentiment delta vs. prior period
  - Immediate implications for AMD stock action (intraday swing, options skew)

- Daily sentiment deep-dive (Sept 10–16, 2025)
  For each date:
  - Total Reddit post volume
  - Sentiment breakdown: Positive | Neutral | Negative
  - Top topics/keywords (e.g., RDNA3/AI accelerators, data center demand, earnings timing, supply chain)
  - Notable posts and influencers/communities
  - Any recurring themes (e.g., valuation concerns, hype around new GPUs, competitive chatter)

- News and public signals recap
  - Relevant company news (earnings, product launches, partnerships, guidance)
  - Industry/peer news affecting AMD (NVIDIA, Intel, TSM, etc.)
  - Macro context (tech budgets, AI compute demand, datacenter capex)

- Sentiment-to-price interpretation
  - Correlation notes between sentiment shifts and price moves (short-term and intraday)
  - Leading vs lagging indicators from social sentiment
  - Potential “information edge” signals (e.g., a spike in negative posts around a rumored issue)

- Risk factors and caveats
  - Noise in retail/brand sentiment vs. fundamentals
  - Event risk (product delays, supply constraints, capex cycles)
  - Data quality concerns (bot activity, off-topic threads)

- Trader-oriented implications and strategies
  - Short-term scalping, swing trading cues tied to sentiment inflection points
  - Options strategies around expected catalysts (e.g., earnings, product launches)
  - Position sizing and risk controls given potential volatility around AI/semiconductor cycles

- Key takeaways and watchlist
  - 1–2 catalysts to monitor next (earnings date, new product announcements, supply chain updates)
  - Stock-level lenses (price levels, volatility bands, macro sensitivities)

- Appendix: Data table (Markdown table)
  - Columns example: Date, Post Volume, Positive%, Neutral%, Negative%, Top Topics, Notable Posts/Influencers, News Highlights, Market Implications, Trader Takeaways

Proposed Markdown table to organize key points (to be populated after data arrives)

- Date
- Post Volume
- Positive Sentiment (%)
- Neutral Sentiment (%)
- Negative Sentiment (%)
- Top Topics/Keywords
- Notable Posts/Influencers
- News Highlights (if any for the date)
- Market Context/Indicators (price move, volume, volatility)
- Trader Takeaways

Next steps I can take right away

- If you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch, tell me which date you want me to prioritize (e.g., just 2025-09-16, or all dates 2025-09-10 to 2025-09-16) and I’ll attempt again as soon as the tool is available.
- If you’re okay with proceeding now using the framework, I’ll generate a polished long-form AMD report with the sections above and clearly marked placeholders for sentiment metrics, ready to fill once the Reddit data comes back.

Would you prefer me to retry the Reddit fetch now, or proceed with the framework and placeholders for the time being?
