Thanks for asking to continue. I attempted to fetch the latest insider sentiment and financial statements for AMD, but the data retrieval tools returned file-not-found errors. Specifically:

- get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment: Error FileNotFoundError
- get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions: Error FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_balance_sheet: Error FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_cashflow: Error FileNotFoundError
- get_simfin_income_stmt: Error FileNotFoundError

I also tried calling the individual tools directly (income statement, insider sentiment, insider transactions) and encountered the same issue. Because of this, I don’t yet have the latest data to compile the week-long, trader-focused fundamental report with insider sentiment/transactions and the most recent balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval now (in case the issue is temporary) and then compose the full report with up-to-date figures.
- If you’d prefer not to wait, I can deliver a comprehensive AMD fundamentals overview based on publicly available information up to mid-2024 and clearly label anything that would require the latest 2025 data. I’ll also outline the exact data points I’d fill in once the tools return data.

Recommended approach (both paths lead to a full, trader-focused report once data is available)
1) Data collection (once tools respond)
   - Insider sentiment (past 15 days from current date)
   - Insider transactions (past 15 days)
   - Most recent quarterly balance sheet (Simfin)
   - Most recent quarterly cash flow (Simfin)
   - Most recent quarterly income statement (Simfin)

2) Analysis focus areas
   - Company profile and segments: Compute and Graphics (CPU/GPU/DPU), data center/server, embedded, gaming, and professional graphics. Comments on product cycles (e.g., Ryzen/EPYC/Radeon lines) and any AI/accelerator initiatives.
   - Financial health: revenue mix by segment, gross margin trend, operating margin, R&D intensity, capital expenditure cadence, free cash flow.
   - Balance sheet dynamics: cash/debt levels, liquidity, leverage trends, working capital movements.
   - Cash flow quality: cash from operating activities vs. net income, capex vs. depreciation, financing activities.
   - Insider sentiment and insider activity: interpretation of any positive/negative signals and potential implications for risk appetite.
   - Historical context: how AMD’s fundamentals have evolved post-2022–2024, including any margin expansion or contraction, growth drivers, and competitive positioning vs. peers.
   - Catalysts and risks: AI/ML demand tailwinds, data center GPU demand, competition with Nvidia/Intel, supply chain, foundry/node advantages, and any macro sensitivities.
   - Valuation context (if data allows): revenue growth rates, margins, ROIC/ROA, and how current multiples compare to historical levels and peers.

Proposed deliverable format (once data is in)
- A comprehensive report covering the five pillars above, with:
  - Narrative analysis and trader-oriented insights (what the trends imply for risk and opportunity).
  - Fine-grained observations (specific line items, segment performance notes, and any unusual items).
  - A concise set of actionable takeaways for traders (e.g., potential catalysts, risk flags, and position ideas).
  - A markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference.

If you’d like me to proceed now with a qualitative AMD fundamentals draft (without the latest week-specific insider data) while I retry the data fetch, I can do that. Otherwise, please confirm that I should retry the data retrieval immediately to complete the full week-long fundamental report with insider sentiment/transactions and the latest financial statements.
