I tried to fetch the Reddit stock news for META for 2025-09-16, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError from the environment. It looks like the Reddit data fetch isn't functioning right now. I can try again if you’d like, but I don’t want to stall you.

In the meantime, I can proceed with a robust plan for the long-form report and begin outlining core insights using non-tool sources (public news and general sentiment patterns) while we wait for the Reddit data to come back. Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now
- Proceed with a manually-curated, high-confidence synthesis based on public signals (news, earnings commentary, and typical sentiment themes around META in 2025)
- Wait and try again later

Provisional approach if you want me to proceed now (no Reddit data yet):
- Objective: Provide a comprehensive view of META (Meta Platforms, ticker META) from social media sentiment and recent news over the past week, with trader-oriented insights and actionable takeaways.
- Sources I’ll synthesize (where available): major news outlets, Meta press/releases, regulatory updates, analyst notes, and typical social channels (X/Twitter, Threads, Reddit discussions) summarized qualitatively.
- Key themes I expect to cover (adjustable once data comes back): AI strategy and product updates, advertising demand and macro effects, user growth/engagement signals on core apps (Facebook, Instagram) and new formats, VR/Metaverse progress with Quest, data/privacy/regulatory environment, competition with peers (Google/Alphabet, TikTok/ByteDance, X, Apple), capitalization and guidance notes, and sentiment drivers (CEO commentary, product launches, earnings expectations).

Proposed structure for the long report (to be fleshed out with data):
- Executive snapshot: Quick read on sentiment tilt, notable headlines, and near-term catalysts.
- Daily sentiment evolution (past 7 days): Granular look at day-by-day mood shifts, notable spikes, and which narratives drove them (AI, ad spend, privacy, hardware).
- Social media themes and signals: What topics are driving the most discussion, whether sentiment is more positive or negative on each theme (AI, ad tech, metaverse, privacy, stock volatility).
- News and events: Summary of recent company news, product updates, leadership comments, major partnerships, regulatory developments.
- Roadmap and risk assessment: What investors should watch in the next quarter (AI features, monetization levers, AR/VR adoption, regulatory risk, competition).
- Trader-oriented implications: Short-term catalysts, position-sizing ideas, risk management notes, and scenario analysis (bull vs. bear outcomes).
- Bottom line and actionable takeaways: Where sentiment and news align or diverge from fundamentals and how to position.

If you’d like, I can also generate a sample Markdown table at the end to organize key points succinctly. Here’s a draft structure you can expect in the final table:
- Theme
- Sentiment Today
- Key News/Event
- Potential Catalyst
- Trader Sensitivity (volatility, liquidity)
- Actionable Takeaway

Sample (illustrative, no data filled yet):
- AI and product updates
  - Sentiment: [Positive/Neutral/Negative]
  - News: [Bullet points about AI features, product launches]
  - Catalyst: [Upcoming event or earnings]
  - Trader Takeaway: [Strategy suggestion]

Please tell me which path you want:
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now, hoping the tool will work, or
2) Proceed with a manual synthesis based on non-Reddit sources, with a detailed qualitative analysis and the final Markdown table as described.

If you pick option 2, I’ll deliver a complete long-form report with a clear narrative, trader-focused insights, and a polished Markdown table at the end.
