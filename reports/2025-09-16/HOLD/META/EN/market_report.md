Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch META data and run the selected indicators, but I hit internal tool errors (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data sources. Specifically, the data retrieval endpoints (Yahoo Finance data and the stockstats indicators reports) returned file-not-found errors. I can retry once the data service is available, or you can try again on your end. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan and the chosen indicators, with rationale tailored for META in a typical large-cap tech/advertising environment.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale
1) close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
- What it measures: 50-day simple moving average, a medium-term trend proxy.
- Why META: Helps identify the prevailing trend direction and dynamic support/resistance levels. Useful for filtering trades in range-bound vs trending phases.
- How to use: Look for price crossing above/below the 50SMA as a trend signal; use in conjunction with the 200SMA to gauge medium-term trend strength.

2) close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
- What it measures: 200-day simple moving average, a long-term trend benchmark.
- Why META: Confirms the broader market regime (bullish if price is above 200SMA, bearish if below). A convergence/divergence with 50SMA (golden cross/death cross) can mark longer-term regime shifts.
- How to use: Prioritize trades aligned with the long-term trend (price above 200SMA for long entries, below for potential reversals). Use as a macro filter.

3) close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
- What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average, a responsive short-term measure.
- Why META: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points, especially around pullbacks or breakouts.
- How to use: Watch for price interactions with the 10EMA for short-term entries; use with the 50SMA for better filter in choppy markets.

4) macd (MACD)
- What it measures: Momentum via the difference between two EMAs (short/long-term).
- Why META: MACD crossovers provide timely momentum-change signals, useful for confirming trend direction suggested by moving averages.
- How to use: Buy signals when MACD line crosses above the signal line; confirm with price action and trend context.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- What it measures: The EMA-smoothing of the MACD line (the signal line).
- Why META: The MACD signal line cross with MACD line helps reduce false positives and refine entry/exit timing.
- How to use: Look for MACD crossing above/below the MACDS line to trigger trades, in combination with other filters.

6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
- What it measures: The gap between MACD and its signal; momentum strength.
- Why META: Histogram expansion shows strengthening momentum; divergence between price and histogram can signal waning momentum before a reversal.
- How to use: Positive, increasing histogram supports uptrends; shrinking or negative histogram can warn of momentum exhaustion or potential reversal.

7) rsi (RSI)
- What it measures: Relative strength index, momentum oscillator.
- Why META: Identifies overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences. Useful for gauging pullbacks within a trend or spotting potential reversals.
- How to use: Common thresholds 30/70; watch for RSI failure to make new highs in an uptrend (bearish divergence) or new lows in a downtrend (bullish divergence). In strong trends, RSI can stay extended; use with the trend signals from moving averages and MACD.

8) vwma (VWMA)
- What it measures: Volume-weighted moving average; price action filtered by volume.
- Why META: Confirms price moves with volume; helps distinguish genuine moves from low-volume noise, which is valuable in high-profile stock moves (META often sees event-driven volume spikes).
- How to use: If price is rising and stays above VWMA with increasing volume, it supports a sustainable uptrend; if price diverges from VWMA on weak volume, be cautious.

Notes on interpretation and usage
- Combine signals: Use the moving averages (50SMA and 200SMA) as a backbone for trend context; use 10EMA for timely entries in the direction of the trend. Use MACD/macd signals and histogram to confirm momentum changes. Use RSI for overbought/oversold nuances and VWMA to ensure volume-backed moves.
- In META’s regime (as with many large-cap tech/advertising names), expect periods of strong trends punctuated by volatility around earnings, regulatory news, ad-market cycles, and platform changes. Favor setups that are aligned with the dominant trend (price above 50SMA and 200SMA for uptrends; price below both for downtrends) and wait for MACD/macd signals and VWMA confirmation to improve odds.
- Risk considerations: MACD and RSI can give false signals in choppy markets. Rely on convergence among indicators rather than a single signal. Use prudent position sizing and consider ATR-based stops to adapt to volatility.

Proposed plan to proceed once data is available
- Re-run the data fetch for META to obtain the latest price history and the exact indicator values for the current date.
- Generate a consolidated report combining the 8 indicators above, with recent crossovers/divergences, current RSI level, and VWMA alignment relative to price.
- Provide a trading verdict (entry/exit/neutral) based on a simple rule set that prioritizes trend alignment and momentum confirmation (e.g., long when price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD bullish, RSI not overbought, VWMA confirming volume).

Markdown table: key indicators, purpose, and how to use (ready to populate with live data once retrieved)

- Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for META | Signals to watch (entry/exit)
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | 50-day trend and dynamic support/resistance | Use as a trend filter; confirm with longer-term trend from 200SMA | Price above 50SMA with bullish price action; price crossing below 50SMA after uptrend
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | 200-day long-term trend benchmark | Confirm regime; align trades with long-term trend | Price above 200SMA with 50SMA supportive; crossover 50SMA >/ below 200SMA indicates regime shift
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Timely entry/exit signals in direction of trend | Price above 10EMA with rising slope; price crossing below 10EMA in downtrend
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum differences via EMAs | Confirm momentum direction with price trend | MACD line crosses above signal line (bullish); cross below (bearish)
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line dynamics | Filter MACD-driven signals | MACD crosses MACDS to trigger trades; alignment with price action
- macdh | MACD Related | MACD histogram momentum | Gauge momentum strength/divergence | Histogram expanding positive (uptrend) or negative (downtrend); divergence with price
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum magnitude and overbought/oversold | Identify extreme conditions and potential reversals | RSI > 70 overbought or < 30 oversold; divergences with price
- vwma | Volume-Based Indicators | Price action weighted by volume | Confirm moves with volume; filter noise | Price above VWMA with rising volume confirms upmove; price below with weak volume warns of reversal or consolidation

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch as soon as the data service becomes available. Alternatively, you can run these calls from your side and share the results, and I’ll integrate them into a full, nuanced report with a finalized trading view and a table of key takeaways.

Would you like me to attempt the data pull again now, or proceed once you have the data?
