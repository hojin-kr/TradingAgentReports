Recommendation: HOLD META right now.

Rationale
- The provided plan rightly weights a compelling long-term bull case (Reels monetization, AI-driven efficiency, platform scale) against meaningful near-term headwinds (one-off cash outlays like settlements, regulatory/compliance costs, ad-market cyclicality). Given that catalysts for a durable margin/ARPU expansion remain uncertain, the Hold stance is prudent to avoid premature capital allocation.
- The valuation appears to price in optimistic growth; without clear, multi-quarter evidence of durable margin recovery and sustained ad-revenue acceleration, a gradual approach (Hold) helps manage downside risk while preserving exposure for future catalysts.

What would prompt a shift to BUY
- Concrete, durable catalysts emerge: two consecutive quarters of above-consensus ad-revenue growth with clear ARPU uplift from Reels/commerce, plus tangible AI-driven opex reductions visible in margins.
- Regulatory outcome that meaningfully lowers ongoing compliance costs or uncertainty, with no material drag on cash flow.
- Sustained price action confirmation: price trades above key trend signals (e.g., sustained cross above 50- and 200-day moving averages) with improving momentum/divergence support.

What would prompt a shift to SELL
- Two straight quarters of ad-revenue disappointment, worsening margin compression, or a meaningful uptick in cash outlays (regulatory or settlement-related) that materially harms near-term earnings power.
- Adverse regulatory developments that raise compliance costs or constrain META’s core monetization channels, with limited visibility on mitigation.

Actionable steps (risk-managed)
- Current exposure: maintain a neutral stance (0–2% of portfolio) until catalysts materialize.
- Stop/trim on breaches: employ stops or a trailing stop if the price breaks key support or momentum deteriorates meaningfully.
- Be ready to scale in on confirmation: if a multi-quarter data suite shows sustained monetization progress and cost discipline, incrementally increase exposure toward a Buy.

Final thought
- The plan’s disciplined, data-driven approach remains valid: Hold now, with a clear pathway to Buy on credible, durable catalysts and to Sell only on meaningful downside surprises.
