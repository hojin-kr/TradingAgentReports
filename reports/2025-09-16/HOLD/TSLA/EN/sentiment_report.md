Sorry about that — I hit an internal tool error retrieving Reddit stock news for TSLA on 2025-09-16 (FileNotFoundError). I can try the fetch again right away. If you’d prefer, I can also proceed with a sentiment and news analysis using other sources (e.g., Twitter/X signals and general news headlines) in the meantime.

What would you like me to do?
- Retry the Reddit data pull for TSLA (2025-09-16)?
- Proceed with a best-effort analysis using available public signals beyond Reddit (no Reddit-specific feed)?
- Wait for the Reddit fetch to succeed and then deliver a full, structured long report with a Markdown table of key points?
