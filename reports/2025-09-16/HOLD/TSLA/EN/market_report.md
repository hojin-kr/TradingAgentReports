I tried to fetch TSLA data for 2024-09-16 to 2025-09-16, but the data service returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError) for the requests. I can retry immediately or wait a moment and try again. In the meantime, here is a robust, actionable indicator plan for TSLA and how to read them, plus a concise table you can reference when the data loads.

Recommended indicators (8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale and how to use them for TSLA
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - What it tells you: Intermediate-term trend direction and potential dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: If price is above the 50 SMA and the slope is rising, it supports a bullish bias. A break below the 50 SMA could signal a short-term correction or a trend pause; look for confluence with other indicators.

- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - What it tells you: Long-term trend direction and major dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Price trading above the 200 SMA generally reinforces a bullish backdrop; a cross of the price below the 200 SMA or a cross of the 50 SMA under the 200 SMA (death/crossover) can indicate a shift toward bearish conviction or a prolonged consolidation.

- macd (MACD line)
  - What it tells you: Momentum direction and strength, via differences of EMAs.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossing above/below the signal line as momentum signals; positive MACD with rising histogram supports upside moves, negative MACD with expanding negative histogram supports downside moves. Divergence with price can warn of potential reversals.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it tells you: Smoothed momentum signal for crossovers.
  - How to use: A crossover of MACD above its signal line (MACDs crossing up) reinforces bullish momentum; crossing below reinforces bearish momentum. Use in conjunction with price position relative to key SMAs and RSI.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it tells you: Momentum strength and acceleration/deceleration.
  - How to use: Increasing positive histogram bars confirm strengthening upside momentum; increasing negative bars confirm accelerating downside momentum. Divergence with price can flag potential reversals ahead of MACD crossovers.

- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - What it tells you: Momentum level and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: RSI around 60–70 supports upside momentum, but watch for overbought readings near or above 70, especially if price is extended or diverging from price action. RSI below 30 can signal oversold conditions; divergences (price making new highs not confirmed by RSI) can warn of reversals.

- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it tells you: Market volatility magnitude, not direction.
  - How to use: Higher ATR means larger expected price moves and can influence position sizing and stop placement. Use ATR to historicize risk and adapt stops, especially in TSLA where volatility can spike around events and earnings.

- vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
  - What it tells you: Price action filtered by volume, helping confirm trend with liquidity.
  - How to use: Price above rising VWMA with VWMA rising suggests volume-backed uptrends; price below VWMA with VWMA declining suggests volume-backed downtrends. Look for alignment between VWMA direction and MACD/RSI signals for higher-probability entries.

How to interpret these together for TSLA (contextual guide)
- Bullish setup (typical when a strong uptrend is forming)
  - Price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA; 50 SMA above 200 SMA or showing a constructive crossover.
  - MACD line above the signal line with a positive histogram; RSI trending above 50 but not extreme; ATR rising modestly indicating ongoing volatility but not an abrupt breakout, and VWMA confirming price action with favorable volume.
  - Practical read: Favor entries on pullbacks to support levels near the 50 SMA or VWMA with a positive MACD histogram and RSI holding above mid-range.

- Bearish/setup (dominant risk scenarios)
  - Price below both SMAs or the 50 SMA crossing below the 200 SMA (bearish cross); MACD below signal with negative histogram; RSI failing below or near 40; ATR rising, signaling growing volatility with price pressure; VWMA weakening or price staying under VWMA.
  - Practical read: Consider defensive exits or hedges, or look for breakdown confirmations with volume support from VWMA.

- Range-bound or mixed signals
  - Price oscillating around SMAs, MACD flat, RSI hovering around 50, ATR relatively subdued, and VWMA not clearly trending.
  - Practical read: Favor fade plays or wait for a clear breakout/breakdown confirmed by volume and MACD crossovers before taking directional bets.
