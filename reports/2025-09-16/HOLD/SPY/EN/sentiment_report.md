Thanks for the update. I ran into a tool error when trying to fetch Reddit stock data for SPY on 2025-09-16 (FileNotFoundError). I can either retry immediately or switch to a fallback approach. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll proceed and what you can expect in a full, data-backed report once the data fetch works.

What I’ll deliver in the full weekly SPY sentiment report
- Data sources (once available)
  - Reddit posts and threads mentioning SPY (primary)
  - X/Twitter mentions and sentiment
  - StockTwits or other retail sentiment streams
  - Recent market/news headlines about macro factors (inflation, rates), big-cap earnings, and geopolitical news
  - ETF-specific signals (SPY fund flows, options beta/put-call skew, VIX, and major index futures positioning)
  - Price action context (SPY price, volume, and key moving averages: 50-day and 200-day)
- Sentiment analytics
  - Daily sentiment score for SPY and post/thread volume
  - Top themes by day (e.g., “Fed expectations,” “earnings mix,” “inflation data,” “geopolitics”)
  - Source concordance: how similar or divergent mood is across Reddit, X, and other sources
  - Momentum indicators from sentiment vs. price moves (e.g., sentiment-driven pullbacks vs. sentiment-confirmed rallies)
- News synthesis
  - Key headlines with brief impact assessment (positive, negative, neutral)
  - Event-driven spikes (earnings reports from large SPY constituents, macro data releases)
- Price/action context
  - Where SPY sits relative to major levels (50/200-day, minor supports/resistances)
  - Recent risk-off/risk-on signals and how sentiment aligns with price action
- Trader implications (granular, not generic)
  - If sentiment is increasingly positive but price severity remains limited, potential breakouts and near-term targets
  - If sentiment is turning negative despite price strength, look for divergence and caution on long exposure
  - How changes in options positioning (put-call skew) could foreshadow volatility or continuation
  - Macro and earnings risk scenarios and what SPY signals would trigger for hedging or hedged longs
- Quick-trade decision framework (non-prescriptive)
  - Triggers to consider for hedging vs. directional bets
  - Balance of risk-on vs. risk-off cues from sentiment vs. macro data
  - Confidence grading for the prevailing theme (e.g., high/med/low) with rationale

What I need from you
- Please confirm whether you’d like me to retry fetching Reddit data now (to pull the latest SPY-specific Reddit sentiment) or proceed with the qualitative framework above and then fill in the data when the tool becomes available again.
- If you have any preferred data sources beyond Reddit (e.g., specific news outlets, or a particular sentiment provider), tell me and I’ll prioritize them.

Next steps
- I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately.
- If the tool continues to fail, I’ll proceed with the structured framework and deliver a detailed, data-ready outline. Once the data retrieval works, I’ll populate the full report and append a Markdown table at the end as requested.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit fetch now, or proceed with the framework first?
