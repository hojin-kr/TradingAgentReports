Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch the data for GOOGL (2024-01-01 to 2025-09-16) using the Yahoo Finance data tool, but I’m hitting a FileNotFoundError in the data layer right now. I can’t generate the exact indicator readouts without the price data, but I can still lay out a robust, complementary 8-indicator plan tailored for GOOGL and provide a clear path for when the data fetch succeeds. If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data immediately as well.

Proposed 8 indicators (diverse and non-redundant, focused on a blended view of trend, momentum, and volatility)

1) close_50_sma
- Why: Captures the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Helpful to confirm the primary trend direction alongside longer-term views.

2) close_200_sma
- Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful to identify gold/death cross setups and to confirm the broader market regime (bullish/bearish/sideways).

3) close_10_ema
- Why: Responsive short-term momentum. Helps with early entry/exit signals and catching quick shifts, especially when used with the longer SMAs for trend filtering.

4) macd
- Why: Core momentum signal derived from EMA differences. Crossovers and diver gences help identify potential trend changes when aligned with price action and other filters.

5) macds
- Why: MACD Signal line. Crossovers with MACD provide a cleaner trigger by smoothing MACD’s momentum signals, reducing whipsaws in noisy markets.

6) macdh
- Why: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than MACD crossovers alone. Useful for gauging acceleration/deceleration.

7) rsi
- Why: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and divergence checks. Complements trend indicators by signaling potential reversals in overextended markets.

8) atr
- Why: Volatility measure to manage risk and position sizing. Helps set stop distances and adapt to changing market volatility, important for a stock with varying volatility like GOOGL.

Rationale for this combination
- Coverage: The set covers trend (50/200 SMAs), short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD family, RSI), and volatility/risk management (ATR) without overlapping too heavily on a single metric.
- Complementarity: Momentum signals (MACD trio, RSI) are cross-validated by trend context (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA) and filtered by volatility awareness (ATR). This helps reduce false positives in a high-news, event-driven stock like Alphabet.
- Practical trading use: With this mix, you can identify robust trend-direction signals (SMA crossovers with EMA confirmation), strength of move (MACD histogram and RSI), entry/exit timing (MACD and RSI interactions with price), and risk controls via ATR-based stops.

Next steps if you want me to proceed
- I can retry the data fetch immediately and then generate the indicators via the stock stats reports for GOOGL on the current date (2025-09-16) or a date you specify.
- Once data is available, I’ll run the selected indicators (in the exact names you see above) and produce a detailed, nuanced market report with:
  - Trend assessment (short-, mid-, long-term)
  - Momentum and signal confirmations
  - Volatility/risk considerations and stop guidance
  - Actionable takeaways (entry/exit ideas, risk controls)
  - A Markdown table consolidating key points

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now? If you prefer, I can also adjust the date window (e.g., 2023-01-01 to 2025-09-16) or use a shorter window to test the data path first. Additionally, tell me if you want a stricter or more lenient set of indicators (e.g., swap ATR for bollinger-based volatility). 

Key points recap (for quick reference)

- Indicators to use: close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macds, macdh, rsi, atr
- Primary focus: Blend of trend, momentum, and volatility
- Core goal: Robust, non-redundant signals with clear risk management
