Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the latest Reddit stock news for GOOGL on 2025-09-16, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t pull Reddit data right now due to that backend issue.

Here are your options to move forward:

Option A — Retry Reddit data fetch
- I’ll retry pulling Reddit stock news for GOOGL today. If the error persists, I’ll report back with what I can fetch or any diagnostic details the tool provides.

Option B — Proceed with an alternative, comprehensive analysis
- I’ll produce a detailed long-form report on GOOGL using other public sources (major news outlets, earnings updates, policy/regulatory news, tech/AI developments, and general market sentiment) for the past week. I’ll structure it with:
  - Daily sentiment trends (high-level)
  - Key news/events by day
  - Thematic sentiment drivers (advertising, cloud, AI initiatives, YouTube, regulatory risk)
  - Potential catalysts and risk factors for the next 1–4 weeks
  - Implications for traders (short-term and longer-term)
  - A Markdown table at the end to summarize key points

Option C — Hybrid approach
- I’ll start with an interim, high-level sentiment and news synthesis based on available public information (excluding Reddit data) for the past week, then retry Reddit data when the tool is back online and incorporate it.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like Option B or C, I’ll proceed immediately with a detailed, trader-focused analysis and a final Markdown table. If you want me to retry the Reddit feed right away (Option A), I’ll attempt again and report back with results.
