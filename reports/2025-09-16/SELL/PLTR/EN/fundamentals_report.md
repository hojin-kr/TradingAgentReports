I attempted to fetch the fundamental data in parallel, but I got a FileNotFoundError from the tool layer for all requests. This means the data retrieval step didn’t complete due to an environment issue, not because PLTR data is unavailable. I can retry the data pulls now, or I can proceed with a structured outline and wait for the tools to come back online.

What I can do next (two options):
1) Retry data retrieval now
- I will re-run:
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment for PLTR on 2025-09-16
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions for PLTR on 2025-09-16
  - get_simfin_balance_sheet (quarterly) for PLTR at 2025-09-16
  - get_simfin_income_stmt (quarterly) for PLTR at 2025-09-16
  - get_simfin_cashflow (quarterly) for PLTR at 2025-09-16
- If some calls succeed while others fail, I’ll assemble what’s available and clearly note gaps and confidence.

2) Proceed with a best-effort framework now
- I’ll provide a comprehensive report structure with placeholders and detailed analysis guidance, so you have a ready-to-fill draft once data comes back.
- I’ll also prepare a Markdown table skeleton at the end that you can populate with the retrieved figures.

Please choose:
- Retry now, or
- Proceed with the best-effort framework and fill in data once the tools are back online.

If you’re ready to retry, I’ll initiate the data pulls immediately and report back with the full set of findings (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) and a detailed trader-oriented interpretation, including potential implications for PLTR’s fundamentals and risk factors.
