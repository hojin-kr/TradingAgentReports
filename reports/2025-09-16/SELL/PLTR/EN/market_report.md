I attempted to fetch PLTR data and run the indicator analyses, but the data retrieval tool (get_YFin_data) is returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I also tried the batch indicator calls, and they failed for the same reason. I can’t produce the data-driven trend report yet. If you’d like, I can retry now, or wait a moment and retry, or switch to a different data window. In the meantime, here’s a clear plan of action and the recommended indicator set I’ll use once the data is accessible, along with why they’re suitable for PLTR.

Recommended indicators (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages (short-term)
  - Why: Captures quick momentum shifts and potential entry signals. Useful for timing in a stock with choppy intraday moves.
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (mid-term)
  - Why: Provides a solid trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level. Helps filter noise from the 10 EMA.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (long-term)
  - Why: Establishes the long-term trend baseline; useful for confirming major trend direction and golden/death cross signals.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Core momentum signal; crossovers with the MACD Signal line indicate potential trend changes. Works well when combined with trend confirmation.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: The smoothed signal line; crossovers with MACD help confirm entry/exit timing and reduce false positives.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: The histogram shows momentum strength and divergence clues; adds a third dimension to MACD interpretation.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Why: Measures relative momentum, flags overbought/oversold conditions, and potential reversals. Use with trend analysis to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Why: Quantifies market volatility; helps in risk management, setting stops, and sizing positions in line with current volatility.

Notes on approach and context for PLTR
- PLTR has shown phases of pronounced moves and periods of consolidation. A combination of trend (50/200 SMA), momentum (10 EMA, MACD family, RSI), and volatility (ATR) provides a balanced framework to detect both breakouts and reversals while managing risk.
- In volatile names, MACD signals should be filtered by the longer-term trend (200 SMA) and supported by RSI levels to avoid false entries during fast pullbacks.
- ATR can help adapt stop placement to changing volatility, which is particularly important for a name like PLTR that can exhibit spikes around news events or earnings.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report describing the current configuration of the eight indicators for PLTR, including:
  - The alignment of short-term (10 EMA) and mid-term (50 SMA) vs long-term (200 SMA) trends.
  - MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram signals with any crossovers/divergences.
  - RSI context relative to 30/70 levels and any divergence observations.
  - ATR-based volatility view and its implications for risk management (stops, position sizing).
  - Any corroborating signals or conflicts between indicators, with trade-idea scenarios (entry, exit, stop placement) tailored to the current trend regime.
- A concise Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points (indicators, what they’re signaling, and caveats).

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer I proceed with a different date range or a smaller look-back window to try to get a quick analytic baseline? If you confirm, I’ll run the full 8-indicator setup and return a detailed report with the Markdown table.
