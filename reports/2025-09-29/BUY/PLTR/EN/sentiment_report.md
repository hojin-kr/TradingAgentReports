Thanks for the follow-up. I’m seeing an internal error with the Reddit stock info tool right now:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

This looks like a tool execution issue on my side, not an input problem. I can try to retry the Reddit feed, or we can switch to a best-effort approach using other publicly available signals if you’d like.

What would you like to do?
- Retry now: I’ll attempt to fetch the latest Reddit-based sentiment for PLTR again and then proceed with a full, detailed long-form report (sentiment-by-day, notable threads, risk/exposure, and implications for traders) plus a Markdown table at the end.
- Proceed without Reddit data: I’ll still assemble a comprehensive PLTR report using other available signals (e.g., general news flow, typical sentiment dynamics around Palantir in recent periods, and a structured trader-focused analysis), but without the Reddit-specific feed.
- Alternative plan: If you have another data source you want me to pull (e.g., a specific news feed or social platform you trust), share it and I’ll incorporate it.

If you want me to proceed with a quick retry now, say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt again immediately. If you prefer the fallback approach, say “Proceed without Reddit.”
