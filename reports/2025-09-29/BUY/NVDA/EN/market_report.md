I attempted to fetch NVDA data and run the indicator checks, but the data retrieval tools returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a system issue rather than an NVDA-specific problem. I can retry fetching the data now or wait for your go-ahead. In the meantime, here is a curated set of indicators (8 total) with rationale tailored to NVDA’s typical market dynamics and a structured way to interpret the results once data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - What it is: 50-period simple moving average.
  - Why it’s relevant: Provides a mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helpful to confirm the prevailing trend when used with price and other timeframes.
- close_200_sma
  - What it is: 200-period simple moving average.
  - Why it’s relevant: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming major trend context (golden/death cross signals) and filtering entries in a high-volatility stock like NVDA.
- close_10_ema
  - What it is: 10-period exponential moving average.
  - Why it’s relevant: More responsive to recent price moves; helps capture quick momentum shifts and potential near-term entry signals when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd
  - What it is: MACD line (the difference between two EMAs).
  - Why it’s relevant: Core momentum indicator; crossovers and divergences can signal trend changes, especially in NVDA’s high-momentum environment.
- macds
  - What it is: MACD Signal line (EMA of the MACD line).
  - Why it’s relevant: Crossover with the MACD line helps confirm momentum signals and filter false positives from MACD alone.
- rsi
  - What it is: Relative Strength Index.
  - Why it’s relevant: Measures momentum and overbought/oversold conditions; useful for spotting potential reversals when used with trend context (recognize that in strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated).
- atr
  - What it is: Average True Range.
  - Why it’s relevant: Measures volatility; essential for setting stops, sizing positions, and understanding the risk environment around NVDA’s moves.
- vwma
  - What it is: Volume-Weighted Moving Average.
  - Why it’s relevant: Combines price action with volume to confirm-trend strength; helps distinguish durable moves from moves driven by low-volume spikes.

How to interpret the signals together (high-level guide)
- Trend alignment: Look for price relative to 50_sma and 200_sma. If price is above both and the 50_sma is above the 200_sma, that’s a favorable trend backdrop. Confirm with 10_ema direction (price above/below the 10_ema) for momentum timing.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and MACDS should be in constructive alignment (MACD above its signal, and rising) for long entries. If MACD shows divergence while price makes new highs, be cautious of a potential reversal.
- Momentum strength vs. fatigue: RSI approaching or exceeding 70 in an uptrend isn’t a standalone sell signal, but it flags potential overbought conditions. Look for confluence with MACD and trend signals.
- Volatility risk management: ATR rising implies growing volatility (use for wider stops and position sizing); ATR contracting flags consolidation risk and may precede a breakout or a pause.
- Volume validation: VWMA should generally align with price moves; if price advances but VWMA lags or diverges, it may indicate weaker conviction.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching NVDA data now and compute these indicators with the exact values. Would you like me to attempt the data retrieval again?
- If you prefer, I can also adjust the indicator set (e.g., swap in boll_ub or boll_lb for breakout context, or add a second volatility/volume metric) based on your trading approach.

Key points at a glance (for quick review)
- Trend: 50_sma and 200_sma provide mid/long-term trend context; 10_ema adds near-term momentum.
- Momentum: MACD and MACDS give trend-change signals; RSI provides overbought/oversold context (with trend awareness).
- Volatility/ risk: ATR helps manage risk and sizing.
- Confirmation: VWMA adds volume-based validation to price action.

Markdown table: Key indicators, what they measure, and why they matter for NVDA

| Indicator | What it measures | Why it matters for NVDA (contextual rationale) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-period simple moving average (mid-term trend) | Helps identify the prevailing trend direction and serves as a dynamic support/resistance; aligns with longer-term trend when price stays above it. |
| close_200_sma | 200-period simple moving average (long-term trend) | Core trend filter; helps assess whether NVDA is in a broad uptrend or downtrend, useful for strategic decisions and risk framing. |
| close_10_ema | 10-period exponential moving average (short-term) | Captures rapid momentum shifts; useful for timing entries when used with longer averages to filter noise. |
| macd | MACD line (momentum signal) | Central momentum gauge; crossovers signal potential trend changes, important for NVDA’s high-momentum moves. |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Confirms MACD signals; reduces false positives by requiring a MACD-to-signal crossover for entries. |
| rsi | Relative Strength Index (momentum/overbought-oversold) | Indicates momentum extremes; watch for divergence and cross-check with trend context to anticipate reversals or continuations. |
| atr | Average True Range (volatility) | Guides risk management (stops, sizing) in NVDA’s often volatile moves; higher ATR means wider stops and potentially larger drawdowns. |
| vwma | Volume-Weighted Moving Average | Validates price moves with volume; helps distinguish genuine demand from price moves driven by anomalies or low liquidity. |

If you’d like, I can attempt the data fetch again now and then provide a detailed, data-driven interpretation based on the actual NVDA values once the retrieval succeeds.
