Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest data for AAPL, but the tool wrapper returned a FileNotFoundError for all five requests. In short, the data sources aren’t accessible in this session right now.

Here are options to move forward:

- Option 1: Retry with sequential calls
  - I’ll run the five requests one by one (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) to isolate any issues and confirm which tool or parameter might be failing.
  - If any single call fails again, I’ll report the exact error and suggest a workaround (e.g., adjusting curr_date or frequency).

- Option 2: Qualitative fundamentals now
  - I can provide a thorough, trader-focused qualitative analysis of AAPL’s fundamentals using general information up to 2024–2025 (no live data from the tools). This would cover company profile, business mix, margins, cash generation, capital allocation, and typical risk factors, plus a structured checklist for what to watch when live data does come in.

- Option 3: Alternate date or parameters
  - If you want, I can try with a different curr_date or a different frequency (e.g., annual instead of quarterly) to see if the issue is date-specific.

What would you like to do? For Option 1, I’ll proceed to fetch data sequentially once you confirm. If you choose Option 2, I’ll prepare a comprehensive, trader-oriented fundamentals report for AAPL right away and include a Markdown table of key points.
