Sorry about that — I attempted to fetch AAPL data but hit a backend file-path error on the data provider. I can retry fetching the data if you’d like, or proceed with a plan that doesn’t require the immediate feed. In the meantime, here’s a concise, actionable plan using up to 8 complementary indicators, along with how I’ll interpret them once the data is available.

Selected indicators (8, diverse and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these 8 are suitable
- They cover multiple facets of market behavior: medium- and long-term trends (50/200 SMAs), short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD family), momentum strength (MACD Histogram), overbought/oversold context (RSI), and volatility risk management (ATR).
- No direct redundancy: SMAs/EMAs give trend direction and support levels; MACD-related indicators provide momentum signals and convergence/divergence context; RSI offers a separate momentum gauge; ATR informs position sizing and stop placement given current volatility.

What I will deliver once data is available
- Trend direction: using close_50_sma and close_200_sma to identify prevailing regime (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) and possible crossovers (e.g., golden/death cross patterns).
- Short-term momentum: close_10_ema in relation to price and to MACD signals (macd/macds/macdh) to time entries/exits within the broader trend.
- Momentum confirmation/divergence: macd crossovers with macds; macdh histogram strength changes to gauge acceleration/deceleration.
- Reversal potential: rsi levels and any notable divergences with price or with MACD signals.
- Volatility and risk controls: atr to adapt stop-loss levels and position sizing to current market volatility.
- Cross-confirmation logic: use a combination of trend direction (SMA), momentum (MACD family), and RSI to validate signals; rely on ATR to adjust risk as volatility shifts.

Draft interpretation framework for AAPL (once data is retrieved)
- Trend assessment
  - Price above 50_sma and 200_sma generally indicates a bullish stance; look for alignment (price above both, with 50_sma above 200_sma as a supporting sign).
  - If price sits below both, or 50_sma crosses below 200_sma, consider a bearish bias or a choppy regime.
- Entry/exit cues
  - bullish: price above 50_sma with a bullish MACD cross (macd crossing above macds) and rising macdh; rsi climbing toward or above 50 but not overbought.
  - bearish: price below 50_sma and 200_sma with a bearish MACD cross and MACD histogram widening to negative; RSI weakening or dipping toward oversold territory with negative divergence possible.
  - Use close_10_ema as a fast filter: price crossing above/below 10_ema can help time intraday/short-term entries within the larger trend.
- Risk management
  - Use ATR to set stop-loss bands appropriate to current volatility; higher ATR suggests wider stops and/or reduced position sizing.
  - If ATR shows a spike, consider tightening exits or reducing position size to manage risk in a high-volatility session.
- Validation steps
  - Require at least two corroborating signals (e.g., MACD cross + RSI confirmation) before entering, and prefer entries aligned with the longer-term trend indicated by 50_sma/200_sma.

Would you like me to retry fetching the AAPL data now? If you approve, I’ll pull the data and generate a full, detailed trend report with the eight indicators above and a concise actionable set of signals tailored to the current date (2025-09-29) and the latest available data. I’ll also append a Markdown table summarizing the points at the end. Here’s the table you’ll get in the final report (as a preview of structure):

| Indicator | Category | Purpose / What to Look For | How to Use (Signal Examples) |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50_sma + bullish cross with price; price below suggests caution; use with 200_sma for regime context |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend baseline | Price above = bullish regime; price below = bearish; watch golden/death cross tendencies with 50_sma |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; quick shifts | Price above = momentum tilt up; price below = momentum tilt down; use for entry timing in line with longer trend |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum shift; trend changes | MACD line crossing above/below MACD Signal; alignment with price trend strengthens signals |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD; crossovers | Cross with MACD line to trigger signals; helps reduce false positives |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength; divergence cues | Rising histogram supports up-move; falling histogram signals weakening momentum; watch for divergences |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold context; momentum strength | RSI >70 = overbought, <30 = oversold; look for reversals or divergence with price |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility and risk management | Higher ATR → wider stops; adjust position size accordingly; use with other signals for entry risk control |

If you prefer, I can proceed with the data fetch and then deliver the full, data-driven report in one go. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.
