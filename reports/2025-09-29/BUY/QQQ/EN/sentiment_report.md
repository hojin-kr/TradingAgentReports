I hit a tool error trying to fetch Reddit data for QQQ on 2025-09-29 (FileNotFoundError). I can retry, or we can proceed with a structured framework and fill in the data once the data pull succeeds. Here are the two options:

Option A — Retry data pull now
- I’ll attempt to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for QQQ again and then deliver a full, detailed long report with sentiment by day, themes, and implications, plus a Markdown table at the end.

Option B — Proceed with framework (no data yet)
- I’ll provide a comprehensive, ready-to-fill report framework you can use immediately. I’ll specify exactly what to capture (data fields, themes, and metrics) so that once the data fetch works, I can drop in the actual numbers and complete the analysis in a follow-up message.

If you’d like, I can do Option A right away. Otherwise, here’s a robust framework you can expect in the final report (once data is available):

Proposed long-report structure (for QQQ, past-week social sentiment + news)
- Executive snapshot
  - Quick read on overall sentiment trend (positive/negative/neutral), notable spikes, and immediate implications for traders.
  - Any obvious disconnects between sentiment and recent price action or volume.

- Data sources and methodology (brief)
  - Sources: Reddit stock discussions, recent news headlines, and any other available public sentiment feeds.
  - Time window: last 7 days (or the exact window you specify).
  - Sentiment scoring approach (e.g., aggregated polarity, topic modeling signals, frequency of topics).

- Daily sentiment overview
  - For each day: sentiment score (net positive vs negative), top keywords/phrases, and notable posts or threads.
  - Correlated price action: intraday close/open/percent move vs sentiment delta.

- Key themes and topics
  - Top recurring topics driving sentiment (e.g., ETF performance, tech sector news, macro headlines, liquidity conditions, Fed expectations).
  - Any new themes that emerged during the week and their potential impact on QQQ.

- News and event timeline
  - Summary of relevant announcements (earnings cues, macro news, regulatory updates, major tech company news that influences QQQ components).
  - How sentiment aligned with or diverged from the news events.

- Sentiment vs price/volume analysis
  - Correlation insights between daily sentiment shifts and price or volume changes.
  - Lead/lag indicators: does sentiment precede price moves, or vice versa?

- Risk factors and potential catalysts
  - Short-term risks highlighted by social chatter (e.g., negative sentiment around tech earnings risk, policy changes).
  - Positive catalysts (e.g., breadth of tech rally, favorable macro data).

- Trading implications and scenarios
  - If sentiment remains biased X, potential short-term setups (breakout, mean-reversion, or event-driven trades).
  - If sentiment deteriorates, risk controls and hedging ideas.

- Limitations and data caveats
  - Representativeness of Reddit discussions, potential bot activity, and news source biases.
  - Any data gaps or timing considerations.

- Summary for traders
  - Takeaways: sentiment posture, likely near-term directional risk, and key questions to monitor next week.

Appendix (data table suggestions)
- A Markdown table to organize key points (to be filled with actual data once retrieved). Example structure:
  - Date | Daily Sentiment | Net Score | Top Topics | Notable Posts | News Event | Price Move | Volume Change | Sentiment-Near-Price Alignment
  - Date: 2025-09-23
  - Daily Sentiment: +0.12 (net positive)
  - Net Score: +12
  - Top Topics: “AI earnings,” “MSFT/NVDA rally,” “Fed rate expectations”
  - Notable Posts: summary of a couple representative posts
  - News Event: brief event
  - Price Move: +0.8%
  - Volume Change: +5%
  - Sentiment-Near-Price Alignment: Observations

Would you like me to proceed with Option A (retry the Reddit data pull now) or proceed with Option B (start with the framework and fill in later)? If you have a preference for any tweaks (e.g., include or exclude certain data sources, focus on a specific time window, or tailor the sentiment scoring), tell me and I’ll incorporate it.
