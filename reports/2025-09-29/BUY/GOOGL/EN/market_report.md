I attempted to fetch GOOGL data from Yahoo Finance (GOOGL, 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-29) but the backend returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a temporary data feed issue on the tool side. I can retry fetching the data, or you can allow me to proceed with a plan and generate the analysis once the data is available. In the meantime, here’s a clear plan with a focused set of indicators and why they’re suitable for analyzing GOOGL in a mid- to short-term framework.

Selected indicators (8 total) with rationale
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level. Helps identify whether price is in a broader uptrend or downtrend and can signal pullbacks to trend lines.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming the dominant regime (bullish vs bearish) and for potential golden/death cross context when paired with shorter averages.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  Why: More responsive to recent price moves; helps capture early momentum shifts and potential entry/exit points, especially in choppy markets when confirmation with longer-term averages is valuable.
- macd (MACD)
  Why: Core momentum indicator showing differences between two EMAs; crossovers indicate potential trend changes. Useful in confirming trend direction when price is above/below important averages.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: Smoother EMA line that provides signal crossovers with the MACD line, helping filter false signals from MACD alone.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  Why: Visualizes momentum strength and its changes; can reveal divergence early and intensity of moves, complementing the MACD lines.
- rsi (RSI)
  Why: Momentum oscillator to spot overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; useful for confirming trend context (e.g., RSI in overbought territory during a strong uptrend may require trend-aligned entries rather than counter-trend plays).
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  Why: Baseline 20-day SMA for Bollinger Bands; acts as a dynamic benchmark for price movement and is often used with the upper/lower bands to gauge volatility and breakout/reversion zones.

What to expect from the final detailed report (once data is available)
- A nuanced narrative that links trend signals (50/200 SMA cross, price relative to 10-EMA) to momentum signals (MACD, MACD Histogram, RSI) and volatility context (Bollinger middle as a benchmark).
- Cross-confirmation assessment: how MACD, RSI, and price position relative to moving averages align to support a hypothesis (e.g., trend continuation vs potential reversal).
- Key levels and risk considerations: likely support/resistance around 50/200 SMA, the role of the RSI in staying with the trend vs signaling potential reversals, and how Bollinger middle interacts with recent price action to flag squeeze/breakout moments.
- Practical trading notes: entry/exit ideas with caveats, suggested use of stop placement in line with ATR or recent swing highs/lows, and how to adjust position sizing given current volatility context.
- A concise summary of the current stance (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) with clear conditions that would flip the view.

Next steps and how I’ll proceed
- I will retry fetching the data for GOOGL as soon as possible. If you’d like, I can also try an alternate date range (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-29) or a shorter window (e.g., last 180 days) to proceed with the indicator analysis in parallel.
- Once the data is successfully retrieved, I’ll generate the indicator-specific reports (get_stockstats_indicators_report) for the 8 indicators listed above, curr_date set to 2025-09-29 (or the actual current date returned by the data), and look_back_days to a reasonable window (e.g., 15–30 days).
- I’ll then deliver a detailed narrative analysis plus a Markdown table highlighting key takeaways and recommended watch zones for GOOGL.

Markdown table: Key indicators, category, and what they indicate
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  Category: Moving Averages
  What it indicates: Mid-term trend direction; potential dynamic support/resistance; useful for trend confirmation and pullback entries.
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  Category: Moving Averages
  What it indicates: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify primary regime and major trend changes (golden/death cross context when aligned with shorter MAs).
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  Category: Moving Averages
  What it indicates: Short-term momentum; quick shifts in price; potential early entry/exit signals, especially when aligned with longer-term MA trends.
- Indicator: macd
  Category: MACD Related
  What it indicates: Momentum changes via MACD line crossovers; helps confirm trend direction and potential reversals in conjunction with price structure.
- Indicator: macds
  Category: MACD Related
  What it indicates: MACD signal line; provides filtered crossovers with the MACD line to trigger signals and reduce noise.
- Indicator: macdh
  Category: MACD Related
  What it indicates: MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and divergence; useful for spotting weakening or strengthening momentum ahead of crossovers.
- Indicator: rsi
  Category: Momentum Indicators
  What it indicates: Overbought/oversold conditions and momentum strength; watch for divergence and confluence with trend signals to anticipate reversals or continuations.
- Indicator: boll
  Category: Volatility Indicators
  What it indicates: Bollinger Middle (20-day SMA) as a dynamic baseline; helps assess volatility context and gauge breakout/reversal potential when price interacts with the middle line.

Important note
- Data retrieval is currently failing due to a backend FileNotFoundError. If you’d like, I can retry now or on your command, or adjust the date range to try to obtain usable data. Once data is available, I’ll pull the 8 indicator reports and deliver the full, detailed analysis with the final mixed-trend narrative and the requested Markdown table.

Would you like me to retry fetching GOOGL data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the indicator analysis plan once the data fetch succeeds? If you have a preferred date range or look-back window, tell me and I’ll adapt.
