Here is a focused, trade-oriented macro and TSLA (Tesla) news synthesis for the past week, using the available Finnhub/Google News inputs and noting data access limitations. Data gaps are noted after the executive summary.

Executive summary
- Near-term catalysts are tilt-positive for TSLA: multiple analyst upgrades and higher price targets ahead of Q3 deliveries, with a notable emphasis on AI/autonomy potential and ongoing delivery momentum. Key targets mentioned include $600 (Wedbush) and $450–$600 range (various firms), signaling renewed bullish sentiment around growth levers beyond hardware growth.
- Delivery backdrop is the main near-term driver: TSLA delivery numbers for Q3 remain the focal point. Headlines repeatedly point to upcoming Q3 deliveries and a possible boost from US tax credits that could sustain demand into the quarter end.
- AI/autonomy narrative remains a core differentiator: FSD v14 expectations and Robotaxi momentum are repeatedly cited as longer-term upside catalysts, with some headlines linking these to long-duration value beyond traditional EV hardware margins.
- Mixed regional demand signals: Europe shows some soft spots (e.g., August sales/slump headlines), which could mask or complicate the overall global demand narrative and pressure margins if sustained.
- Market structure risk: With several price-target upgrades and a strong rally in recent weeks (per the headlines), the stock may be more sensitive to delivery/margin disappointment or any delays around FSD milestones.

Data landscape and limitations
- Finnhub feed: Attempted to pull TSLA news for 2025-09-22 to 2025-09-29, but the feed returned a FileNotFoundError in this session. The Finnhub component is not currently delivering accessible data for this window in my run.
- Google News feed: Produced a comprehensive set of TSLA-forward headlines for 2025-09-26 to 2025-09-29, including price targets, Q3 delivery expectations, and AI/autonomy-related developments. Representative headlines indicate bullish sentiment around Q3 deliveries, AI/autonomy potential, and multiple price-target revisions higher.
- Reddit/EODHD data: Not accessible in this session due to tool response issues; I can pursue these if you want me to retry or fetch via an alternate path.

What the week’s headlines imply for TSLA (fine-grained, actionable takeaways)
- Valuation/sentiment tilt: Deutsche Bank, Wedbush, and other firms have raised price targets into the Q3 update cycle, signaling that Streetviews see Tesla re-accelerating as AI/driven autonomy and efficiency gains emerge alongside steady deliveries. Expect outsized moves on delivery numbers or any commentary around FSD v14 and Robotaxi timelines.
- Q3 delivery cadence: The market appears to be positioning for a delivery beat or at least a robust delivery narrative into the quarter-end. If deliveries track higher than consensus amid strong demand drivers (US tax credits, robust demand for AI-enabled features), it could support multi-quarter upside in TSLA.
- AI/autonomy as a multi-quarter driver: FSD v14 readiness and Robotaxi momentum are repeatedly framed as either near-term catalysts (milestones met or close) or long-term value enhancers. If FSD v14 rolls out smoothly and has a favorable reception, it could transform gross margins and software monetization dynamics, potentially supporting higher multiples beyond EV hardware.
- Regional nuance and risk: Europe has been highlighted as a potential weakness with softening demand/market share pressures in some coverage. While not a systemic regional collapse, persistent weakness here could temper margin resilience and curb upside if global volumes don’t offset regional softness.
- Competitive and macro trade-offs: Upgrades and higher price targets are supportive but hinge on demand staying resilient amid competition, evolving subsidies/tax credit regimes, and potential supply chain shifts. The macro backdrop—rates, inflation, and energy policy—will modulate how sustainable the pull from upgrades is.

Trading-oriented implications and scenarios
- Bullish setup (delivery + AI momentum): If Q3 deliveries exceed expectations and FSD v14/Robotaxi milestones are met with favorable reception, and if US EV tax credits provide steady support, TSLA could extend recent gains. Watch for continued upgrades or price-target revisions and for any commentary signaling early profitability in software subscriptions or autonomous features.
- Caution scenario (regional softness + headline risk): If European demand weakening persists and is coupled with softer-than-expected deliveries or margin pressure, the stock could face a pullback even amid AI narrative strength. Such a scenario would likely be driven by delivery misses, margin compression, or delays in AI rollout.
- Market reaction to Q3 print: Expect the stock to be highly sensitive to the delivery figure, gross margins, and any quantified commentary around FSD v14 adoption rates. A miss or soft guidance could trigger a quick risk-off move, while a beat with a clear AI-driven monetization path could spark a stronger rally.

Macro and policy context to watch (relevant to TSLA as a global EV and AI/robotaxi play)
- Subsidies and tax credits: Any changes to US EV subsidies or requirements to qualify for tax credits can materially alter demand trajectories. A favorable regime would amplify the AI-feature-led demand narrative for Tesla.
- Energy and battery dynamics: Battery costs, raw material supply, and production efficiency influence Tesla’s margin trajectory. If battery costs continue to decline and manufacturing efficiency improves, this can sustain margin resilience even if hardware ASPs moderate.
- Global demand shifts: European market softness juxtaposed with strong demand in North America/APAC could steer regional margins and capital allocation. It’s important to assess how Tesla adapts pricing, incentives, and aftersales to sustain global volumes.
- AI regulatory risk: As autonomous technologies mature, regulatory clarity around robotaxi operations and safety standards will be a longer-term driver of profitability. Any negative regulatory stance could delay monetization timelines.

What I would watch next (data-collection plan)
- Obtain EODHD coverage for TSLA: End-of-day historical data, if possible, to corroborate the delivery cadence signals and price action around the week’s headlines.
- Retrieve up-to-date Finnhub TSLA news for 2025-09-22 to 2025-10-03 (or the latest available window) to triangulate sentiment and verify the breadth of coverage beyond Google News.
- Monitor official Tesla communications on Q3 deliveries, FSD v14 rollout timelines, and any Robotaxi program updates.
- Track macro data releases around energy policy, subsidies, and inflation expectations that could influence EV demand or cost of capital for growth stocks like TSLA.

Key risks to consider for risk management
- Delivery risk: If Q3 deliveries disappoint or if the ramp on AI/autonomy features faces delays, downside risk could materialize quickly.
- Margin risk: Rapid AI software monetization hinges on adoption; if take-up is slower than expected or if hardware costs remain elevated, margins could underwhelm.
- Regional exposure: European demand weakness could pressure near-term performance and valuation, particularly if North American demand cannot fully offset it.
- Valuation sensitivity: The stock has seen multiple upgrades and sentiment-driven moves; a negative surprise could trigger sharper downside given the high bar set by the recent pace of upgrades.

Next steps
- I can re-run data collection to fetch EODHD and Finnhub TSLA feeds for a broader window, and pull Reddit and Google results again to triangulate sentiment with more sources.
- If you want, I can build a quick scenario-based trading note with objective probability weights (e.g., base/bull/bear cases for Q3 delivery outcomes) and suggest potential options structure (e.g., tight strangles around the delivery window, or calendar spreads depending on implied vol).

If you’d like, I can proceed to retrieve the missing data (EODHD and Finnhub for the TSLA window) and expand the analysis with more granular numbers (delivery targets, margin commentary, AI monetization metrics) to sharpen the trading playbook.
