TSLA analysis setup

- Data retrieval issue: I attempted to fetch TSLA price data using get_YFin_data, but the call failed with a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). I tried a broader date range, but the same backend issue persists. This means I can’t yet produce a data-driven, detailed trend report for TSLA at the moment.

What I can do now

- Propose an 8-indicator setup that will give you a well-rounded view once the data pipeline is working again. This set provides trend direction, momentum, and volume validation without overlapping too much.

Recommended indicators for TSLA (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)

- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance (mid-term view)
  - Why TSLA: Helps identify the prevailing trend around a volatile stock and acts as a reference for pullbacks.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Long-term trend confirmation; benchmark for major trend regimes (golden/death cross context)
  - Why TSLA: Useful for strategic framing given TSLA’s growth/volatility history.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Short-term momentum shifts; potential entry/exit flare
  - Why TSLA: Captures quick shifts in sentiment, useful for choppy periods where longer averages lag.

- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Role: Momentum change signals via EMA differences; trend-change cues
  - Why TSLA: Helps identify shifts in momentum that may precede price moves, especially around news/quarterly cycles.

- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Role: MACD signal line smoothing; trigger for trades when crossing MACD
  - Why TSLA: Reduces noise by confirming MACD-driven signals.

- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Role: MACD Histogram; momentum strength and divergence hints
  - Why TSLA: Divergence signals can warn of weakening trends before price reversals.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Role: Overbought/oversold levels and momentum strength (with standard thresholds)
  - Why TSLA: Useful for spotting extreme momentum in a volatile name and potential reversals when aligned with trend context.

- vwma
  - Category: Volume-Based Indicators
  - Role: Volume-weighted trend confirmation; reinforces price action with volume
  - Why TSLA: TSLA often moves with strong volume surges; VWMA helps filter moves that aren’t volume-supported.

How to use these together (when data becomes available)

- Trend framework: Compare price against 50_SMA and 200_SMA to determine the primary trend. Look for confluence (e.g., price above both, bullish long-term trend).
- Momentum confirmation: Use MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram in conjunction with RSI to verify momentum strength and potential reversals. Favor signals where MACD crosses up with RSI rising but not yet in overbought territory.
- Short-term timing: Use 10_EMA for quick entry/exit signals in line with the broader trend and MACD momentum.
- Volume validation: Confirm price moves with VWMA to avoid trading breakouts that aren’t supported by volume.

Next steps

- I can retry data retrieval as soon as the backend issue is resolved. If you’d like, I can also run the analysis with an alternative data source or use a cached/previous TSLA dataset if available.
- Alternatively, I can proceed to generate a detailed, trend-based report once get_YFin_data succeeds, and I’ll fill in the full narrative, including an interpretation of the exact signals and actionable trade ideas.

Proposed report structure (to fill once data is available)

- Executive snapshot: current price relative to 50_SMA and 200_SMA; MACD vs MACD Signal; RSI level; VWMA confirmation.
- Trend analysis: alignment of price with major moving averages; long-term vs short-term trend stance.
- Momentum assessment: MACD histogram trajectory, RSI posture, any divergences.
- Volume context: VWMA signals and volume spikes supporting price moves.
- Potential scenarios: bullish continuation, pullback opportunity, or reversal risk with trigger levels.
- Risk considerations: ATR-based stop ranges, position sizing guidance if you’re using these indicators in a live plan.

Key points table

| Indicator | Role | Current TSLA context (to be filled after data) |
|---|---|---|

| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | To be filled with cross/price position context |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum shifts | To be filled with recent cross/price action |
| macd | Momentum shift signals | To be filled with MACD vs Signal status |
| macds | MACD signal smoothing | To be filled with recent cross events |
| macdh | Momentum strength/divergence | To be filled with histogram trend |
| rsi | Overbought/Oversold momentum | To be filled with RSI level and potential divergences |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend | To be filled with volume-backed moves |

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or should I proceed with a fallback approach (e.g., using a cached dataset or waiting for the backend to recover)? If you have a preferred date range or a different data source, tell me and I’ll adapt.
