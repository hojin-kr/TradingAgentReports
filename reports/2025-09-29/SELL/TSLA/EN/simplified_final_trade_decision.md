# Investment Report: TSLA
## Executive Summary
Sell TSLA now. Hedge the position and set risk controls. Re-enter only after multiple data points show credible monetization progress.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: SELL TSLA with hedging and risk controls. Confidence: High.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Valuation vs progress risk: The stock appears priced for strong autonomous monetization that isnâ€™t proven at scale yet.
- Margin and capital expenditure risk: Ongoing capacity expansion and competition could squeeze near-term margins.
- Autonomy/regulatory timing: Monetization hinges on regulatory clearances, user adoption, and cost-to-serve improvements.
- Regional and competitive headwinds: China/Europe dynamics add uncertainty to growth and margins.
- Data and milestone risk: If monetization data remains weak or misses milestones, downside pressure rises.
- hedging preserves optionality: Protects downside while keeping potential upside if monetization signals improve.

## Risks To Watch
- Near-term monetization milestones: FSD subscriptions, Robotaxi economics, and software margins.
- Regulatory changes: Rules or subsidies that affect autonomy monetization and demand.
- Delivery and margin signals: Any slowdown in deliveries or weaker margin improvements.
- Competitive and regional dynamics: Increased competition or policy shifts in key regions.
- Data reliability: Gaps or delays in key data that confirm monetization progress.
- Market environment: Macro moves that can amplify price swings regardless of fundamentals.
