Based on the provided investment plan and current risk-reward considerations, my recommendation is to Sell TSLA now, with hedging to protect against downside and a disciplined re-entry framework if monetization milestones prove credible.

Recommendation
- Primary stance: Sell Tesla (reduce long exposure to neutral or implement a small short if you have the appetite for directional risk).
- If you’re uncomfortable outright selling, implement hedges to cap downside while keeping some upside potential.

Rationale (why this follows from the plan)
- Bear case leverage remains material: near-term monetization (FSD subscriptions, Robotaxi, fleet software) is not proven at scale; valuation already prices in substantial optionality.
- Structural risks persist: hardware margin pressure, capex cadence, regulatory/regional headwinds (notably China), and competitive intensity.
- Data/milestone risk: near-term data signals (deliveries, margins, software monetization progress) are critical to sustaining a multi-year bull case.

Concrete trader actions
1) Trim/exit exposure
- If already long, reduce exposure by roughly 40–60% to move toward neutral or small short exposure, depending on risk tolerance.

2) Hedging to protect the downside
- Protective puts: Buy near-the-money puts with a 6–9 month horizon to establish a floor on downside. Choose a strike that caps potential loss on the remaining TSLA position without overpaying for protection.
- Collar option approach: Sell a slightly out-of-the-money call to partly fund a protective put, effectively creating a downside floor with capped upside.
- Alternatives if options are expensive: consider a sector/market hedge (e.g., a high-beta tech/auto ETF put) as a proxy to dampen downside rather than a full TSLA option package.

3) Risk controls and triggers
- Position sizing: Limit total TSLA exposure to a small percentage of capital (e.g., 1–3% per name, adjusted for overall risk budget).
- Stops and dynamic trimming: Use price-based stops and adjust trims if deliveries/margins miss expectations or regulatory/regional news weighs on the stock.
- Re-entry triggers: Reassess and potentially re-accumulate only if concrete monetization milestones show clear, near-term cash-flow and margin improvements (e.g., meaningful software + hardware margin expansion, confirmed subscriptions, or Robotaxi economics with a credible path to profitability).

4) Monitoring and catalysts
- Track: quarterly deliveries, gross margins by segment (hardware vs software), FSD adoption/subscriptions, energy storage deployments, and China/Europe regulatory signals.
- Be vigilant for downside catalysts (missed milestones, regulatory setbacks, or weaker-than-expected demand).

5) If you want a ready re-entry point
- Consider re-accumulation only after multiple data points corroborate a credible monetization ramp and margin expansion, with price levels that offer a reasonable risk-reward versus prior highs.

Final note
- This stance emphasizes capital preservation given the uneven monetization timeline and potentially lofty valuation. If upcoming data confirms a credible near-term cash-flow path, you can progressively re-enter.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
