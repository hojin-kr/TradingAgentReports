I hit an internal error with the Reddit stock info tool (FileNotFoundError) when trying to fetch TSLA data for 2025-09-29. I’ve retried several times, but the tool remains unavailable on my end. I can retry again in a moment, or you can tell me to try later. In the meantime, I can lay out a detailed analysis framework and a draft report structure so we’re ready to fill in the data as soon as the tool is functioning.

What I can deliver now
- A comprehensive framework for analyzing TSLA using social media sentiment, public chatter, and recent news.
- A structured outline of what to look for day-by-day over the past week, and how to translate that into actionable trader insights.
- A ready-to-fill Markdown table template at the end to organize key points once the data is available.

Proposed approach for TSLA (past week up to 2025-09-29)
1) Social media sentiment analysis (overview)
- Day-by-day sentiment: quantify-positive, neutral, and negative posts mentioning TSLA on major platforms (Reddit, X, threads, etc.).
- Top themes: identify recurring topics (e.g., AI/Full Self-Driving updates, price actions, earnings chatter, China exposure, supply chain, new Model updates, energy products, charging network, regulatory concerns).
- Influencers and credibility: note if sentiment is driven by well-known analysts, executives, or enthusiasts vs. generic posts.
- Sentiment momentum vs. price action: look for lead/lag relationships between sentiment shifts and TSLA price/volume moves.

2) News sentiment and catalysts (past week)
- Headlines and impact: summarize notable company/news items (product announcements, price adjustments, regulatory/legislative mentions, leadership statements, public disputes, manufacturing updates).
- Market reaction: how the stock moved on or after these news items (intraday moves, intraday volatility, volume spikes).

3) Key themes likely affecting traders
- AI and autonomy: sentiment around FSD updates, safety patches, regulatory approvals, and vs. user experience.
- Price and economics: investor perception of margins, pricing strategy (vehicle price cuts, discounts), demand signals.
- China/Global exposure: sentiment around manufacturing, supply chain, and sales performance outside the U.S.
- Energy business: sentiment around energy storage, solar, and charging network as growth vectors.
- Competition and macro: reactions to EV peers, inflation, rates, and macro news affecting EV demand.

4) Market microstructure signals
- Volume spikes, price breakouts or gaps, options activity (if data available), and open interest changes around news events.
- Implied volatility shifts around major announcements or expected catalysts.

5) Trader-oriented insights and implications
- Short-term trades: when sentiment pivots align with positive/negative news, possible entry/exit levels and risk controls.
- Medium-term thesis: whether sentiment trends support a bullish or bearish thesis given catalysts (e.g., AI progress, production ramps, regulatory clarity).
- Risk flags: over-optimism after overhyped headlines, or excessive pessimism lacking fundamental support; exposure to regulatory risk in key markets.

6) Reporting structure (to be filled with data)
- Executive snapshot: one-page summary of current sentiment stance and near-term risk.
- Daily sentiment log: day-by-day bullets with key post themes and notable posts.
- News roundup: bullet points of each notable item with quick market reaction notes.
- Thematic synthesis: a concise section connecting themes to price action.
- Trader playbook: actionable ideas, risk controls, and a watchlist for the next 1–2 weeks.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed narrative report with day-by-day sentiment, top themes, and a news digest.
- A insights section mapping sentiment and news to potential trading implications.
- A risk-oriented section with scenarios and triggers.
- A final Makrmarkdown table at the end to organize key points (see template below).

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the Reddit stock info for TSLA now or at a time you prefer. If you’d like, I’ll attempt again immediately and then generate the full report with up-to-date data.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a fully data-agnostic draft now and fill in the data once the tool is back, so you have a ready-to-publish long-form report.

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit stock data fetch now, or
- Wait and proceed with the framework and template, and fill in data later?
