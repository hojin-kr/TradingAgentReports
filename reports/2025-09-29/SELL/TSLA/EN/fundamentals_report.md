I’m running into a data retrieval issue. The attempts to fetch TSLA insider sentiment, insider transactions, and Simfin balance sheet/income statement/cash flow all returned a FileNotFoundError. That means I can’t currently pull the underlying data to build the comprehensive fundamentals report you asked for.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can reissue the same data requests in a moment to see if the issue was transient.
- Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals overview: I can deliver a detailed analysis of Tesla’s business model, segments, competitive position, capital structure, and potential catalysts/risks based on publicly available knowledge up to now. This would be descriptive rather than data-backed with the latest filings.
- Provide a partial framework now: I can give you the structure and placeholders of the full report, so once the data tools are available again, I can fill in the quantitative sections (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, insider sentiment/transactions) quickly.
- You supply data: If you can share the latest figures (or export files) for insider sentiment/transactions and the quarterly Simfin statements, I can assemble the full report with a detailed, traders-focused interpretation.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, please choose one:
1) Retry data fetch now and report back with results (I’ll try again immediately).
2) I’ll prepare a qualitative, fundamentals-focused report on TSLA (no new data fetch required).
3) I’ll provide a ready-to-fill report template with sections and the exact data points I’ll populate once the data is available. 

Also, if you have a preferred date window (e.g., past 4 quarters, or the most recent quarter) or a focus area (insider sentiment, insider transactions, or financials only), tell me and I’ll tailor accordingly.
