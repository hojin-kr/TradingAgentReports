Thanks for the update. I’m running into an internal error with the Reddit data tool right now:

- The get_reddit_stock_info call is returning a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the tool backend is missing a required data file, so I can’t fetch Reddit-based sentiment for SPY at the moment.

Here are two viable options to move forward:

Option A — Retry the Reddit data fetch now
- I can try the Reddit data tool again in a short while to see if the backend issue is resolved.
- If it works, I’ll immediately pull the latest SPY Reddit sentiment for the past week and produce the full long-form report with daily sentiment, notable threads, and key micro-trends.

Option B — Proceed with a fallback analysis using other sources
- I can deliver a comprehensive SPY sentiment and news report for the past week using available public sources beyond Reddit (e.g., X/Twitter sentiment, major financial news headlines, StockTwits chatter, ETF/indices news, macro events).
- This won’t be identical to the Reddit-focused view, but it will still provide detailed, trader-oriented insights: macro drivers, sentiment heat, daily flow, risk factors, and actionable implications.

What would you like to do?
- If you’d like to proceed with the fallback (Option B), I’ll generate a thorough, trader-focused report for SPY covering sentiment and news from the past week, plus a detailed implications section and a final markdown summary table.
- If you prefer to retry the Reddit data tool (Option A), I’ll attempt again now and report back with the Reddit-sourced sentiment once the tool responds.

Note: Either way, I’ll structure the final report with detailed insights, risk considerations, and a clear set of implications for traders, and I’ll append a Markdown table at the end to organize the key points.
