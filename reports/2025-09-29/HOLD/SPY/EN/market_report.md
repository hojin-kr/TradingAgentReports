I'm running into a tool error fetching SPY data right now.

What happened
- I attempted to fetch SPY data from Yahoo Finance via get_YFin_data for 2024-09-29 to 2025-09-29, but the environment returned a FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory. This looks like an internal data-bridge issue (the CSV file isn’t available in the tool’s workspace), not an issue with SPY itself or your request.

What I can propose right now
- I can retry the data fetch as soon as the data bridge is available again.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a robust indicator plan using SPY once the data download works, and deliver a detailed, nuanced report with a clear table of insights.
- Alternatively, if you have a preferred date window or want me to retry with a smaller window (e.g., last 12 months) or a different ticker, I can try that as soon as the tool is functioning.

Recommended indicators to use (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
I’m planning to select up to 8 indicators that provide trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context for SPY, without redundancy. The following set is my preferred starting point once data is retrievable:

- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Rationale: Mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm medium-term trend in SPY.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming overall market regime and spotting potential golden/death-cross contexts.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - Rationale: Short-term momentum sensitivity. Captures quick shifts and potential entry points, especially around pullbacks/bounces.
- macd (MACD)
  - Rationale: Core momentum signal via EMA differences. Useful for detecting momentum regime changes and potential trend changes.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Rationale: Smoother confirmation of MACD crossovers; helps filter false signals when used with MACD.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Rationale: Momentum strength visualization and divergence clues; complements MACD for early momentum shifts.
- rsi (RSI)
  - Rationale: Momentum-based overbought/oversold context; helps identify potential reversals when used with trend filters.
- atr (ATR)
  - Rationale: Volatility context for risk management and position sizing; informs stop-placement and risk controls.

What I’ll deliver when data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report that:
  - Analyzes the SPY price action in the context of the selected indicators.
  - Explains how the current readings across these indicators align or diverge (e.g., trend confirmation vs. momentum fatigue, volatility regimes, etc.).
  - Highlights potential entry/exit considerations given both trend direction and momentum/volatility signals.
  - Distinguishes short-term signals (10 EMA, MACD components) from longer-term signals (50/200 SMA, RSI context, ATR-driven risk management).
  - Provides hedge or risk-management implications in case of rising volatility (ATR) or potential trend reversals (MACD/Divergences, RSI extremes).
- A concise, readable Markdown table at the end listing key observations, the indicator signals, and practical trading takeaways.

Proposed next steps
- If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry get_YFin_data now or after a short wait.
  - Or retry with a different date window (e.g., 2023-09-01 to 2025-09-29) or a shorter window (last 12-18 months) to see if the tool accepts a narrower range.
  - Or proceed with the same indicator plan once data becomes available and deliver the full report immediately after retrieval.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer I retry with a different date window or ticker? If you’re okay with waiting, I’ll run the data fetch and then generate the full 8-indicator analysis plus the detailed narrative and the summary table.
