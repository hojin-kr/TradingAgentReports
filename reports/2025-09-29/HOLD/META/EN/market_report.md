I’m running into a backend data retrieval issue right now. The get_YFin_data call for META is returning a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch the actual price history to compute and present live indicator readings. If you’d like, I can retry after a short interval or proceed with a robust indicator plan and a qualitative assessment based on typical META dynamics. Below is a carefully chosen, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators with rationale tailored to META (the parent company of Facebook) in a mid- to long-term trading context.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average)
  Why: Establishes the medium-term trend direction and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful for spotting sustained trend shifts in META as ad-market cycles unfold.
  Trade implication: Price consistently above 50SMA suggests a bullish trend bias; crossing below can signal a trend shift or pullback.

- close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm the overarching regime (bullish/bearish) and can validate golden/death cross setups when paired with shorter-termMA.
  Trade implication: Price above 200SMA supports a bullish frame; sustained move below may indicate longer-term weakness or consolidation.

- close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average)
  Why: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quicker shifts in price direction that can precede larger trend moves.
  Trade implication: Price crossing above/below the 10 EMA can provide early entry/exit cues, especially when aligned with MA crossovers.

- macd (MACD line)
  Why: Core momentum measure based on differences between EMAs; helpful to spot trend changes and divergences.
  Trade implication: MACD line crossing above the signal (and turning positive) can be a bullish cue; crossing below can be bearish—best when corroborated.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD generate more reliable signals when used together with other filters.
  Trade implication: MACD vs MACDS crossovers help confirm entries/exits; avoid acting on MACD alone in choppy markets.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  Why: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence magnitude; useful for gauging non-lagging momentum changes.
  Trade implication: An increasing positive histogram supports bullish momentum; a shrinking or negative histogram can warn of fading momentum.

- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  Why: Momentum indicator that flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Complementary to trend indicators.
  Trade implication: RSI around 70+ can indicate overbought risk in uptrends; around 30-40 can signal oversold or support for momentum; watch for divergences with price.

- atr (Average True Range)
  Why: Volatility gauge for risk management and position sizing. Important for META due to episodic volatility around earnings and ad-market news.
  Trade implication: Rising ATR suggests expanding volatility (adjust stops/position sizes); contracting ATR indicates calmer conditions and potentially tighter ranges.

Notes on context for META
- META’s price dynamics are heavily influenced by advertising demand cycles, AI/tech headlines, regulatory considerations, and engagement metrics. The above mix prioritizes:
  - Trend confirmation (50SMA, 200SMA, 10EMA)
  - Momentum signals (MACD family, RSI)
  - Volatility risk management (ATR)
- This combination provides complementary insights: trend direction, momentum strength, potential reversals, and risk controls without overlapping signals like using both stochastic and RSI.

Next steps
- If the data service becomes available again, I’ll fetch META’s historical data and compute the indicators, then deliver:
  - A detailed trend/trade analysis with current readings and actionable signals
  - Potential entry/exit levels or zones based on the combination of signals
  - Scenario-based guidance (bullish continuation, pullback, or range-bound conditions)
- If you prefer, I can substitute RSI with a volume-related indicator like VWMA for additional confirmation, but with the current eight-indicator limit I’ve prioritized a balanced mix focused on trend, momentum, and volatility.

Would you like me to retry data retrieval now, or proceed with a hypothetical run-through (using assumed signal states) to illustrate how to interpret these indicators for META? I can also add a live-ready Markdown summary table if you want a quick reference. Here is a compact version you can reuse:

Key points table
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Category: Moving Averages | What it measures: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance | Signals to watch: Price above confirms trend; price crossing below signals potential weakness or pullback | Practical use for META: Aligns with ad-cycle-driven trends and helps filter entries during choppy episodes
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Category: Moving Averages | What it measures: Long-term trend baseline | Signals to watch: Price above supports bullish regime; cross below can indicate longer-term caution | Practical use for META: Long-horizon trend confirmation and cross-reaction checks
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Category: Moving Averages | What it measures: Short-term momentum | Signals to watch: Price above/below indicates quick momentum shifts | Practical use for META: Early entries/exits in the presence of momentum
- Indicator: macd | Category: MACD Related | What it measures: Momentum via EMA differences | Signals to watch: MACD line vs signal cross, positive/negative momentum | Practical use for META: Confirm trend changes with other filters
- Indicator: macds | Category: MACD Related | What it measures: MACD signal line | Signals to watch: Crossovers with MACD line | Practical use for META: Reduces false positives
- Indicator: macdh | Category: MACD Related | What it measures: Momentum strength via histogram | Signals to watch: Histogram growth/decay | Practical use for META: Gauge momentum durability
- Indicator: rsi | Category: Momentum Indicators | What it measures: Relative momentum and overbought/oversold | Signals to watch: Divergence, extreme readings | Practical use for META: Reversal potential alongside trend filters
- Indicator: atr | Category: Volatility Indicators | What it measures: Market volatility | Signals to watch: Rising/falling ATR for stop placement and sizing | Practical use for META: Adapt risk management to volatility regimes

If you’re ready for me to retry data retrieval, say “retry,” and I’ll attempt again as soon as the backend is available.
