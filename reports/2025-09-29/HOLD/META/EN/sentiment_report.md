Sorry—the Reddit data fetch for META on 2025-09-29 failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the tool. I can’t pull the latest Reddit-based sentiment right now. I can proceed in a couple of ways, depending on what you prefer:

Options
- Retry and continue: I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch and, as soon as it returns, compile the full report with social media sentiment, recent news, and implications for traders.
- Qualitative deep-dive now: I’ll produce a comprehensive analysis using a structured framework (sentiment trends, themes, and recent news) based on general patterns and publicly known signals up to today, with clear caveats that it may not reflect the exact last-week Reddit data.
- Hybrid: I can start with a qualitative framework now and, once the Reddit tool works again, plug in the actual Reddit findings to finalize the report.

What I can deliver right away (without the Reddit pull)
- A detailed framework for META’s current state, focusing on:
  - Sentiment drivers (advertising revenue outlook, AI initiatives, privacy/regulatory concerns, metaverse/Reality Labs progress, platform changes like Reels, AI features, user engagement)
  - Recent news themes (AI deployments, policy/regulatory updates, regulatory probes, earnings commentary if available, product launches)
  - Potential trading implications and scenarios (bullish/bearish/base case) with risk factors
  - A structured methodology for sentiment analysis (daily sentiment, volume, key themes, notable posts)
  - A Markdown-ready table at the end with key takeaways
   
If you’d like me to proceed now, please choose:
- “Retry Reddit data once more” to attempt pulling Reddit sentiment again, or
- “Proceed with qualitative analysis now” to get the thorough report without the latest Reddit data (with caveats).

Proposed report structure (for when I have data)
- Executive snapshot
- Data sources and methodology
- Daily sentiment overview (last 7 days)
- Key themes and drivers (ads health, AI advances, VR/metaverse updates, privacy/regulation, competition with TikTok/others)
- Company news highlights (past week)
- Social media volume and engagement patterns
- Notable posts and sentiment signals (examples, without quoting unless provided)
- Risk factors and implications for traders
- Trading ideas and scenarios (baseline, bull, bear)
- Summary and actionable takeaways
- Appendix: data table and visuals
- Markdown table (key points)

If you want me to proceed right away with the qualitative analysis, say “Proceed with qualitative analysis now.” If you’d rather retry the Reddit fetch, say “Retry Reddit data.”
