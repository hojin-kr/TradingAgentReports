# Investment Report: META
## Executive Summary
META faces near-term risks from ad cycles, macro headwinds, and large AI/data-center spending. Data reliability issues prevent a clear entry signal; the prudent stance is to Hold until signals stabilize.

## Investment Decision
Hold â€” Moderate confidence. Maintain hedges and wait for reliable data inputs before sizing exposure.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Data inputs are unreliable. The live indicators cannot be calculated due to data issues (FileNotFoundError), so a confident entry plan cannot be executed.
- Near-term headwinds risk earnings: advertising cycle weakness, broader macro risks, regulatory/privacy pressures, and substantial AI/data-center capital spend.
- Multi-signal checks cannot be trusted right now. Without coherent, verifiable signals, do not commit meaningful capital.
- Long-term AI monetization thesis remains plausible (targeted ads, app engagement, data advantages), but requires reliable data inputs to scale safely.
- A cautious approach with hedging and small, staged exposure fits risk control priorities in a data-dependent, uncertain environment.

## Risks To Watch
- Data reliability issues persist; eight-signal gating remains unusable, delaying credible entry.
- Signals fail to materialize or turn negative, keeping the stock unattractive at current levels.
- Ad market weakness or worsening macro conditions undermine near-term revenue visibility.
- Regulatory/privacy developments or changes in data rules could constrain monetization.
- Large AI/data-center spending or cost pressures squeeze margins or delay expected gains.
- Competitive dynamics (e.g., changes at Google/YouTube, TikTok, X) affect user engagement and monetization opportunities.
