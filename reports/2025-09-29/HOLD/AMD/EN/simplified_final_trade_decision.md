# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD makes microchips for PCs, games, and data centers. Near-term headwinds from Nvidia’s lead and regulatory risks could restrain upside, but long-run AI/data-center strength may boost profits if ROCm and partnerships prove durable. Hold for now; upgrade only on durable, multi‑pillar catalysts.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term headwinds could limit upside: Nvidia’s dominance in top workloads, China/export controls, and costs from ramping new products could weigh on revenue and margins in the near term.
- Potential longer-term upside from AMD’s multi-vector AI/data-center plan: AI inference, ROCm ecosystem momentum, and memory/bandwidth tailwinds could expand AMD’s addressable market over time.
- ROCm momentum matters: If ROCm shifts from pilots to recurring engagements, it could improve revenue visibility beyond one-off tests.
- Multi-pillar catalysts needed: Upgrade to Buy only if several durable signals appear together (not just one positive datapoint).

## Risks To Watch
- Data-center bookings and demand: Weakening orders or slower adoption could curb growth.
- ROCm adoption risk: If traction stays limited, revenue visibility remains unclear.
- China/export controls: Ongoing or intensified rules could reduce growth outside other regions.
- Product ramp costs and margins: New products may weigh on profitability during ramp periods.
- Competitive pressure: Nvidia’s lead in key workloads and other rivals could limit AMD’s market share gains.
- Macro semiconductor cycle: Overall industry downturn or volatility could affect demand and pricing.
