Recommendation: Hold for now. Maintain the flexibility to upgrade to Buy if catalysts confirm and to downgrade to Sell if risks materialize.

Rationale (why Hold aligns with the plan)
- Near-term headwinds are meaningful: regulatory/tariff exposure in China, potential margin pressure during ramp, and Nvidia’s continued lead in flagship AI workloads.
- The bull case (AI/data-center platform, ROCm momentum, HB-DIMM margin tailwinds) remains plausible but has not proven durable at scale across customers and workloads yet.
- A disciplined Hold preserves upside exposure if catalysts deliver, while limiting downside if near-term data disappoints.

Catalysts to watch (watch for upgrades to Buy)
- Sustained data-center bookings growth over two consecutive quarters.
- Clear, measurable ROCm traction across multiple workloads and customers, with meaningful recurring engagements.
- Signals that China/regulatory drag is moderating or offsetting growth, with credible management mitigation plans.
- Margin stabilization or improvement tied to HB-DIMM-related product mix over a 4–8 quarter horizon.

Catalysts that could push toward Sell (or downgrade)
- Softening AI capex timing leading to weaker bookings or ROCm adoption slower than expected.
- Structural persistence of China/ex-China revenue constraints with little near-term relief.
- Disappointing margin performance during ramp phases that breaches defined thresholds.

Risk controls and tactical notes
- Position sizing: keep AMD exposure balanced within a diversified portfolio; avoid large directional bets until catalysts align.
- Hedging options: consider protective puts (6–12 months out) or a collar to cap downside while preserving upside.
- Stop framework: implement price- and volatility-based stops (e.g., ATR-based or percentage from recent swing highs).
- Cadence: review on a quarterly basis against the catalyst checklist; upgrade only when multiple catalysts show durable progress.

Actionable next steps (if you want a tactical plan)
- I can tailor option-based hedges (strike choices, expiries) and provide a probabilistic upgrade path with numeric thresholds tied to quarterly results.

 FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
