I ran into a data retrieval issue trying to pull YFin data for AMD, which prevented generating the indicator calculations right now. Specifically, the data fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError from the environment. I can retry the data pull immediately, or proceed with a clearly defined plan using a simulated workflow until the data tool is available again. Let me know which you prefer. In the meantime, here’s a concrete, actionable plan and a selected set of indicators that would give AMD-focused, complementary insights once the data is retrieved.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators, diverse and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction over a medium horizon; helps identify support/resistance and filter signals in conjunction with faster tools.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming major regime shifts (e.g., golden/death cross concepts) and for strategic positioning.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures short-term momentum shifts; good for early entry/exit cues when used with longer-term averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum gauge; crossovers with the signal line indicate potential trend changes; works well with trend filters.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoother line that helps confirm MACD crossovers and reduce false signals when paired with other indicators.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; useful when divergence is present, especially in consolidated markets.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-day SMA). Encapsulates a dynamic price benchmark; baseline for understanding price relative to recent volatility.
- atr: ATR. Measures market volatility; instrumental for setting stop losses and sizing positions in line with current volatility.

Why these indicators are suitable for AMD (contextual notes)
- AMD is a tech/hardware stock with cyclical demand and sensitivity to broader market risk sentiment and semiconductor cycles. The mix above provides:
  - Trend orientation (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA) to identify regime and align with risk tolerance.
  - Momentum confirmation (MACD, MACD Signal, RSI) to validate entries/exits and avoid chasing noise in choppy ranges.
  - Volatility context ( Boll middle and ATR ) to gauge breakout potential and to manage risk via dynamic stops and position sizing.
- The combination minimizes redundancy (e.g., avoids overloading with both Stochastic RSI and RSI; uses MACD with its signal line rather than duplicating momentum signals) while still providing a comprehensive view.

What I’ll deliver once data is retrieved (detailed, nuanced report)
- A trend assessment: current positioning relative to 50/200 SMA, test of the 10 EMA vs price, and any emerging cross signals (golden/death cross tendencies).
- Momentum analysis: MACD vs MACD Signal crossovers and histogram momentum, RSI level context with any divergences, to infer potential continuations or reversals.
- Volatility and breakout context: Bollinger middle/bands behavior and ATR to gauge breakout likelihood and to calibrate risk management.
- Trading implications: synthesis of the above into actionable takeaways (e.g., trend confirmation, pullback entry, breakout setup, or a cautionary note in overextended conditions).
- If you’d like, I can also add a lightweight volume lens (e.g., VWMA) if you want to consider volume-driven signals in future runs.

Next steps
- Option A: I retry the data pull now and, once successful, I run the 8 indicators above and provide a full, numbers-backed report with insights, signals, and a trading plan.
- Option B: You approve using a shorter date range (e.g., last 6–12 months) or a specific window (e.g., Q4 2024 to present) to see more recent dynamics first.
- Option C: If you prefer, I can proceed with a placeholder analysis using dataset-agnostic interpretations (no price levels) to illustrate how to interpret the signals in AMD without raw numbers, then swap in real data when available.

Proposed indicators table (for quick reference)
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend via 50-day average
  - Interpretation for AMD: Look for price trading above/below the 50 SMA as a trend filter; cross with price for potential pullback entries in uptrends or resistance tests in downtrends.
  - Trade consideration: Use to align entries with the prevailing trend; longer-term traders may wait for a cross above/below the 200 SMA for stronger conviction.
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - What it measures: Long-term trend strength
  - Interpretation for AMD: Confirm regime (bullish if price above 200 SMA; bearish if below). Watch for golden/death cross signals with the 50 SMA for strategic positioning.
  - Trade consideration: Adds a high-level bias; avoid aggressive entries that contradict the dominant regime.
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum
  - Interpretation for AMD: Quick momentum shifts; price above/below 10 EMA can signal near-term tilt, especially when aligned with longer-term trend.
  - Trade consideration: Use as a timing tool for entries/exits in conjunction with MACD RSI.
- Indicator: macd
  - What it measures: Momentum and trend strength via MACD line
  - Interpretation for AMD: Crossover above/below MACD line relative to the signal line indicates potential trend changes; watch for divergence from price action.
  - Trade consideration: Combine with RSI and price trend for higher-probability signals.
- Indicator: macds
  - What it measures: MACD Signal line smoothing
  - Interpretation for AMD: Confirm MACD cross signals; a cross with MACD line can reinforce entry/exit decisions.
  - Trade consideration: Helps reduce false positives from the MACD line alone.
- Indicator: rsi
  - What it measures: Momentum strength and potential reversals
  - Interpretation for AMD: Readings above 70 suggest overbought risk; below 30 suggest oversold bias; look for confirmations or divergences.
  - Trade consideration: Use with trend context; in strong trends RSI can remain extended.
- Indicator: boll
  - What it measures: Bollinger middle band as dynamic price benchmark
  - Interpretation for AMD: Price interaction with the middle band reveals mean-reversion tendencies and trend strength; band squeeze/spread informs volatility.
  - Trade consideration: Use with other signals to spot breakouts or pullbacks.
- Indicator: atr
  - What it measures: Market volatility
  - Interpretation for AMD: Rising ATR indicates higher volatility; helps calibrate stop-loss and position sizing.
  - Trade consideration: Use to adjust risk controls; combine with price action signals to avoid over-sizing during volatile periods.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry data retrieval now,
- Adjust date range,
- Or proceed with a data-ready placeholder analysis and fill in the numbers once the data tool is healthy again.
