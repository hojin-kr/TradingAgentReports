I’m running into a tool error fetching Reddit stock news for AMD on 2025-09-29: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like an issue with the tool backend rather than your query. I can try again, but I don’t want to stall if you’d prefer to proceed with alternatives now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll attempt again as soon as you confirm).
- Proceed without Reddit data for now and use other available sources to start the AMD sentiment/news analysis.
- Pause and wait for the tool issue to be resolved, then run the full analysis in one go.

If you’d like, I can start with a structured plan and a framework for the AMD analysis, so when the data source is available I can drop in the actual figures immediately. Here’s the plan and what I’d deliver in the final long report.

What I would deliver in the AMD sentiment/news report (structure and approach)
1) Executive snapshot
- Quick read on sentiment trajectory over the past week (positive/neutral/negative) and overall social volume for AMD.
- Highlight top 3 drivers pushing sentiment (e.g., AI datacenter demand, GPU price/availability, earnings expectations, product roadmap announcements).

2) Social media sentiment analysis (daily granularity)
- Daily sentiment scores (e.g., -1 to +1 or 1–5 scale) and volume for AMD mentions.
- Proportion of positive, neutral, negative posts each day.
- Short bullet on notable posts or themes driving sentiment spikes (e.g., influencer comments, investor threads, notable product discussions).

3) News and events roundup (past 7 days)
- Summary of AMD-related headlines (earnings, product launches, partnerships, supply chain updates, regulatory notes).
- How news items align with or contradict social sentiment.
- Any notable earnings or guidance signals that could shift sentiment in the near term.

4) Thematic and driver analysis
- AI/datacenter demand and AMD’s share of hyperscale workloads.
- GPU market dynamics (competition with Nvidia, supply constraints, pricing trends).
- Product roadmap and pipeline impact (new architectures, accelerators, embedded/edge opportunities).
- Supply chain, manufacturing considerations (foundry capacity, multiyear cycles).
- Geopolitical, regulatory, or macro factors affecting demand and pricing.

5) Risk and uncertainty assessment
- Key downside risks (e.g., demand softness, supply escalation by competitors, delays in new product cadence).
- Key upside catalysts (strong AI deployment, data center refresh cycles, new OEM partnerships).

6) Trading implications and scenarios
- Short-term scenario analysis (1–4 weeks): best-case, base-case, worst-case sentiment and price reaction.
- Medium-term view (1–3 months) given product launches, guidance revisions, and market conditions.
- Key indicators to watch (social volume spikes, sentiment shifts, news catalysts, hedge/fund positioning if data available).

7) Data quality notes
- Data sources used (Reddit, Twitter/X, StockTwits, news wires, company press releases).
- Any potential biases or limitations (sample sizes, platform demographics, market hours alignment).

8) Appendices (optional)
- Methodology details (how sentiment is computed, handling of sarcasm, topic categorization).
- A glossary of terms.

Makrdown table (to organize key points)
I’ll include a table at the end of the final report like this (will be populated with actual data when available):

- Date
- Platform / Source
- Mention Topic
- Sentiment (Score)
- Volume (Mentions)
- Notable Insight / Quote
- Implication for AMD (Short-term / Medium-term)

Example skeleton (to be filled in after data retrieval):
| Date | Platform / Source | Mention Topic | Sentiment (Score) | Volume | Notable Insight | Implication for AMD |
|------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| 2025-09-23 | Reddit / r/investing | AI data center demand | +0.8 | 1,240 | Positive chatter around AI workload adoption | Potential near-term upside pressure on AMD stock |
| 2025-09-24 | Twitter/X | GPU pricing trends | -0.2 | 3,100 | Mixed sentiment on pricing; supply comments | Caution on near-term profitability margins |
| 2025-09-25 | Newswire | AMD earnings guidance | +0.5 | 900 | Upbeat take on data center demand; guidance reaffirmed | Possible sentiment lift; watch for price action |

Next step options
- Tell me to retry now and I’ll attempt to fetch the Reddit data again.
- Or tell me to proceed immediately with a qualitative AMD analysis anchored on non-Reddit sources (I’ll note the limitation of Reddit data in the write-up).
- Or specify a date window (e.g., last 7 days) and I’ll structure the analysis accordingly once data is available.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the non-Reddit-based analysis plan?
