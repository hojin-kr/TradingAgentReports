Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock data for NFLX on 2025-09-29, but the tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). It looks like there’s a temporary issue with the data retrieval tool right now.

What I can do next
- Retry the Reddit data fetch for NFLX on 2025-09-29 automatically.
- If the Reddit tool continues to fail, I’ll proceed with a best-effort analysis using available public signals (noting the data source gap) and clearly mark what’s missing until the Reddit data is retrievable.
- Once data retrieval succeeds, I’ll deliver a comprehensive long report as requested, including: sentiment by day over the past week, key themes, notable NFLX news, and implications for traders, ending with a MakrMarkdown table of key points.

What I’ll deliver in the final report (when data is available)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment direction, notable momentum drivers, and a quick risk/uncertainty read.
- Daily sentiment analysis (past 7 days): parse Reddit discussions for bullish/bearish signals, notable spikes, and any recurring themes (content quality, user credibility, obvious catalysts).
- News & events: synthesis of recent NFLX-related headlines (product, earnings, guidance, pricing, regulatory, competition, content strategy, user growth, platform changes).
- Market implications: how sentiment and news might translate into near-term price action, including potential catalysts and risks.
- Trade ideas and risk considerations: short-term catalysts, longer-term considerations, and risk management notes.
- Data appendix: a table summarizing key points, sources, and sentiment polarity by day.

Requesting your guidance
- Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now and proceed with the full analysis as soon as it returns?
- Or should I proceed with a provisional analysis using available public signals (not Reddit-based) and clearly label the data gap, then finalize once Reddit data is back?

If you prefer, I can also proceed with the provisional framework immediately and fill in the Reddit-derived specifics as soon as the tool issue is resolved. Just say "proceed with provisional analysis" and I’ll start outlining and summarizing what is currently observable from other sources, while keeping the Reddit data section pending.
