Summary verdict: Hold NFLX now.

Rationale
- Data dependence remains critical: the bull case hinges on ads monetization, international ARPU expansion, and durable margin uplift. The plan notes data gaps and uncertain near-term momentum indicators, which adds downside risk if any one lever underperforms.
- Margin and cost risk persist: content costs plus potential ad-market volatility abroad could limit EBITDA/margin improvements in the near term, even as subs and ARPU progress slowly.
- Competitive and macro headwinds: international churn, currency/regulatory dynamics, and competitive pacing in IP/content could pressure pricing power and unit economics.
- Valuation and execution risk: the stock looks priced for progress; without confirmatory EBITDA/margin momentum and solid monetization proof, upside remains contingent on multiple moving parts aligning.
- Data-driven discipline remains intact: the plan emphasizes delaying full-scale exposure until clear, multi-signal momentum is evident. That prudent stance reduces risk of a premature upgrade.

What would trigger a Buy (data-backed upgrade)
- Consecutive quarters showing tangible EBITDA margin expansion and free cash flow improvement.
- Sustained ad monetization momentum (CPMs, fill rates, ARPU) with evidence it is durable across regions, plus stabilizing international churn.
- Clear, confirmed price-volume momentum across technical indicators (e.g., price above key moving averages with positive MACD, constructive RSI, expanding ATR, and genuine volume confirmation).
- Management guidance aligning with improving unit economics and EBITDA trajectory.

Actionable plan (kept aligned with Hold thesis)
- Position: Maintain a cautious stance; no oversized builds. If you're already long, consider trimming to core exposure or using tight stops rather than adding aggressively.
- Risk controls: Use defined risk (stops, limited starter exposure if you initiate coverage), and prefer staged exposure only on confirmed momentum signals.
- Monitoring triggers: Put in place a watchlist for ad-revenue metrics, international ARPU uplifts, and EBITDA-margin progression after upcoming earnings or catalyst events.

Bottom line: Hold now. If and when data returns with consistent margin improvement and durable monetization momentum, progressively upgrade toward a Buy with a disciplined, staged entry.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
