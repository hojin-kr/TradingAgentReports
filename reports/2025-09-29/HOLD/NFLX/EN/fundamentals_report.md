I attempted to fetch the NFLX fundamental data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) using the data tools, but all calls returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like an internal data access issue right now. I can retry the data pulls, or you can authorize me to retry automatically after a short delay. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll proceed once the data access is restored, plus a ready-to-fill report structure you can use.

What I can do next (once data access is functioning)
- Re-run all five data requests in parallel (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement) for NFLX with curr_date = 2025-09-29.
- Compile a comprehensive fundamental report that covers:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Recent financial snapshot (quarterly) with key line items
  - Balance sheet highlights and liquidity/solvency metrics
  - Cash flow dynamics (operating, investing, financing)
  - Income statement trends (revenue, EBITDA, margins)
  - Insider sentiment (reading tone and notable changes in the past 15 days)
  - Insider transactions (executed trades, sizes, potential implications)
  - Historical financial history (trend analysis over the last 4–8 quarters/years)
  - Valuation angles (multiples, profitability metrics, growth rates)
  - Trader-oriented insights (risk factors, catalysts, scenarios)
  - Key takeaways and a concise verdict
- Append a Markdown table at the end organizing the key points for quick review.

Alternative: proceed with a qualitative framework if you’d like me to summarize without fresh data
- I can provide a structured template report with placeholders and guidance on how to interpret typical Netflix fundamentals, plus what to watch for (e.g., subscriber growth vs. ARPU, content spend intensity, free cash flow trends, capital allocation moves, and typical insider activity patterns). Note that without the latest data, these would be generic expectations rather than NFLX-specific numbers.

If you’d like, I can:
- Retry the data pulls now and report back with the full comprehensive NFLX fundamentals as soon as I have the data.
- Or proceed with the qualitative framework and a ready-to-fill Markdown table you can populate later with actual figures.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer the qualitative framework and a template report first? If you want me to retry automatically, I can initiate another round of tool calls right away.
