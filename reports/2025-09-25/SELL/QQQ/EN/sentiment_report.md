Thanks for the prompt. I ran into a tool error fetching Reddit data for QQQ across the requested dates:

- The Reddit data fetch attempt returned FileNotFoundError: "No such file or directory" for all requested dates.
- I’m unable to retrieve the latest Reddit post sentiment data at the moment due to this tool issue.

Two options to move forward:

1) Retry the Reddit data pull now
- I can try again immediately or after a short pause to see if the environment issue resolves and fetch the latest Reddit sentiment for QQQ from 2025-09-19 to 2025-09-25.

2) Proceed without Reddit data (qualitative + alternative sources)
- I can deliver a comprehensive long-form report focusing on: 
  - The broader sentiment landscape around QQQ and its mega-cap tech constituents (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, META, etc.)
  - Recent public news and macro drivers likely affecting QQQ (AI/machine learning themes, tech earnings, rate expectations, inflation data, geopolitical/regulatory context)
  - Sentiment proxies from other social channels (without direct Reddit data) and price/volume action
  - Implications for traders: potential setups, risk considerations, and scenarios to watch
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry Reddit data now, or
- Proceed with a Reddit-free, best-effort qualitative analysis using the latest public news and macro context

If you’d like me to proceed without Reddit data, I’ll deliver a detailed report with:
- Day-by-day sentiment narrative (qualitative) for 9/25 through 9/19, based on available public signals
- Notable news items about QQQ’s top holdings and related ETFs
- Key driver analysis (AI/tech earnings, rate expectations, policy/news catalysts)
- Risk factors and potential trading implications
- A final Markdown table of key takeaways and actionables

Let me know your preference.
