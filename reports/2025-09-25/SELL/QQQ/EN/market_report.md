I ran into an environment issue pulling the data (FileNotFoundError) from the Yahoo Finance data source, so I don’t have the actual QQQ price history or the computed indicator values right now. Here’s what I can do and what I’ve prepared in the meantime.

What I’ve prepared for QQQ
- Indicator set (8 indicators) selected to be complementary and non-redundant:
  - close_50_sma
  - close_200_sma
  - close_10_ema
  - macd
  - macds
  - rsi
  - atr
  - vwma

Rationale for this selection
- 50 SMA and 200 SMA: Provide a clear view of medium- and long-term trend context. They help distinguish regime (bullish/bearish) and potential dynamic support/resistance zones. Using both helps avoid over-reliance on a single benchmark.
- 10 EMA: Captures near-term momentum shifts and can signal quicker entries/exits; acts as a timely counterpoint to the smoothed SMA signals.
- MACD and MACD Signal (macd, macds): Core momentum indicators that highlight trend changes via line crossovers and momentum strength. They complement the moving averages by focusing on momentum rather than price level alone.
- RSI: Momentum oscillator to identify overbought/oversold extremes and potential reversals/divergences, providing a counterpoint to trend indicators.
- ATR: Volatility gauge to inform risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and to contextualize price action (e.g., high ATR during breakouts).
- VWMA: Volume-confirmed price trend; helps distinguish genuine price moves from low-volume noise by incorporating volume into the trend signal.

What I will deliver once data loads
- A detailed, nuanced report describing:
  - The current trend context combining price action with the 50_SMA and 200_SMA (and how close the price is to these levels).
  - Short-term momentum signals from the 10_EMA and MACD pair, including MACD vs MACD_Signal crossovers and histogram (if applicable).
  - Momentum strength and potential reversal signals from RSI, including any divergences if present.
  - Volatility and risk context from ATR to inform stop-loss levels and position sizing.
  - Volume-confirmed trend insights from VWMA, including whether price action is supported by volume.
  - Cross-checks and potential signal clusters (e.g., price above 50_SMA + MACD bullish crossover + RSI > 50) vs weaker clusters (e.g., price near 50_SMA with RSI near overbought and rising ATR).
  - Practical trading ideas: entries/exits, stop placement, risk management, and condition-based alerts.
- A concise Markdown table at the end summarizing key signals and action guidance (one-row-per-indicator with interpretation and suggested actions).

Next steps (your call)
- I can retry pulling the data now that you’ve seen the plan, or you can retry on your end. If the data source continues to be unavailable, I can proceed with a hypothetical, scenario-based analysis to illustrate how the 8 indicators would interact for QQQ under different market regimes. Which would you prefer?
- If you have a specific date range or a different data source you want me to use, tell me and I’ll adapt.

Markdown table: Key indicators, what they measure, and how to interpret for QQQ
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  What it measures: 50-period simple moving average (medium-term trend)
  Interpretation: Price above suggests a bullish intermediate trend; price below suggests a bearish intermediate trend. Watch for price crossing above/below for potential entries/exits; use with other signals to avoid lag-induced false positives.

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  What it measures: 200-period simple moving average (long-term trend)
  Interpretation: Price above indicates long-term bullish context; price below indicates long-term bearish context. Golden cross (50 SMA crossing above 200 SMA) or death cross (50 SMA crossing below 200 SMA) can be meaningful trend signals when combined with price action and momentum.

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  What it measures: 10-period exponential moving average (short-term momentum)
  Interpretation: Price above implies short-term bullish momentum; price below implies short-term bearish momentum. Useful for fast-tracking entries or exits in trending conditions, but can be noisy in choppy markets; filter with longer-term trends.

- Indicator: macd
  What it measures: MACD line (momentum) vs. signal line
  Interpretation: Bullish signal when MACD crosses above the signal line (often when above zero); bearish signal when MACD crosses below the signal line. Best used in conjunction with price trend indicators to avoid false positives in range-bound markets.

- Indicator: macds
  What it measures: MACD Signal line (smoothing of MACD)
  Interpretation: Crossovers with the MACD line provide trade signals; corroborate with price action, RSI, or trend context to reduce noise.

- Indicator: rsi
  What it measures: Relative Strength Index (momentum)
  Interpretation: Readings above 70 imply potential overbought conditions; below 30 imply potential oversold conditions. Detections of divergence (price vs RSI) can signal pending reversals, especially when aligned with trend signals from moving averages and MACD.

- Indicator: atr
  What it measures: Average True Range (volatility)
  Interpretation: Higher ATR means higher volatility; lower ATR means calmer markets. Use to size positions and place stops (e.g., ATR-based distance). Helps avoid premature stops in volatile environments and prevents over-sizing in calm markets.

- Indicator: vwma
  What it measures: Volume-Weighted Moving Average (price with volume)
  Interpretation: Price above VWMA with rising volume supports a bona fide uptrend; price below VWMA with weak volume supports a downtrend. Helps filter price moves by confirming with volume strength.

Note: The above reflects a plan and interpretive framework. I’m ready to run the data fetch again and produce the full, data-driven detailed report with the table included as soon as the data source is accessible.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or proceed with a scenario-based illustrative report in the meantime?
