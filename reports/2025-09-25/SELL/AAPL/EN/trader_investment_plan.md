Recommendation: Sell (trim/underweight) with hedges. Aligns with the bear thesis that near-term catalysts and macro/regulatory headwinds create asymmetric downside risk, even if the long-term bull case remains intact.

Rationale (concise):
- Near-term risks are material: hardware demand maturation, regulatory scrutiny (App Store dynamics, data monetization), and China exposure add uncertainty to earnings visibility and margins.
- High multiple in a volatile macro backdrop raises downside risk if policy headlines or macro softness trigger multiple compression.
- While Services and AI catalysts offer longer-term upside, they may not fully offset near-term softness in hardware and regulatory constraints in the near horizon.

Actionable steps (prioritized):
1) Trim exposure now
- Reduce AAPL to a 3–5% cap of the portfolio (underweight relative to benchmark), preserving optionality for re-entry if data improves.
2) Implement a protective hedge on remaining exposure
- Put hedge: buy puts with strike near-the-money or modestly in-the-money, 3–6 months out, to limit downside.
- Collars (alternative): long protective put plus short call to fund the hedge; size the hedge to cover the residual position without capping upside beyond what you’re willing to concede.
3) Data-driven reassessment triggers
- If iPhone demand stabilizes or Services margin accelerates meaningfully and regulatory risk eases, progressively re-accumulate toward a more neutral or buy-weight.
- If regulatory/china headwinds intensify or hardware demand deteriorates further, increase hedging or trim further.
4) Reallocation plan
- Channel proceeds into diversified mega-cap tech with lower regulatory/geo-risk tilt, defensives with strong cash flow, or higher-conviction growth names with clearer near-term catalysts.
5) Risk controls and cadence
- Establish a stop/stop-trail on the remaining AAPL position relative to the hedge (e.g., trailing stop or ATR-based level).
- Schedule a quarterly review to decide on re-entry, further trimming, or reallocations.

Monitoring framework (high-level):
- Trend: price vs. 50/200-day moving averages
- Momentum: MACD, RSI
- Volatility: ATR for sizing and stop placement
- Triggers: data-driven thresholds for Services growth, hardware demand signals, regulatory updates, and China trajectory.

Learning and execution mindset:
- Triangulate trend, momentum, and volatility with macro/policy context.
- Model downside scenarios (base, bear, severe) to avoid single-outcome bias.
- Maintain hedges to limit downside while keeping optionality for future re-entry.

If you’d like, I can tailor a concrete execution plan with current target hedges, precise strike choices, and explicit price-triggered re-entry points. 

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
