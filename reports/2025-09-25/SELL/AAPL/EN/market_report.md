I attempted to fetch AAPL price data to compute the indicators, but I hit an environment error:

- get_YFin_data failed with FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory.
- Attempting to fetch multiple indicators in parallel also failed due to the same data retrieval issue.

I can’t generate the actual indicator readings or a trend analysis until the price CSV is available. If you want, I can retry in a moment, or you can share the data CSV or enable the data source in the environment. In the meantime, here is a clear plan: I’ll use up to 8 complementary indicators that give a well-rounded view of trend, momentum, and volatility. Once the data is available, I’ll deliver a detailed, nuanced report with the observed values and actionable interpretations.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Used to gauge the mid-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Helps filter noisy entries when used with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming major trend direction and for identifying golden/death cross scenarios.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. A responsive short-term trend indicator to spot quick momentum shifts and potential entry points. Best used with longer-term averages to avoid noise.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum oscillator that highlights trend changes via EMA differences. Crosses can signal potential entries/exits, especially when aligned with trend context.
- macds: MACD Signal. The signal line. Crossovers with MACD provide more reliable trade triggers when used with other filters.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength visualization and divergence clues. Helpful for spotting growing or waning momentum in conjunction with MACD lines.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index. Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold signals and potential reversals. Divergence with price can be a powerful early warning.
- atr: Average True Range. Volatility measure used for risk management, position sizing, and stop-placement. Provides context on market turbulence and helps avoid tight stops in high-vol environments.

Why these 8 in combination
- They cover three essential axes: trend (50/200 sma, 10 ema), momentum (MACD family and RSI), and volatility/risk (ATR). This mix gives you both confirmation and early warning signals without heavy overlap.
- Including the MACD trio (macd, macds, macdh) adds depth on momentum strength and trend coherence, which can improve signal quality when market conditions are stable or gently trending.
- RSI provides an alternative momentum view to MACD, helping to spot potential reversals that MACD alone might miss.
- ATR ties everything to risk management, ensuring position sizing and stop logic reflect current volatility rather than a fixed percentage.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A thorough narrative describing: trend direction (based on SMA crossovers and EMA signals), momentum posture (MACD lines versus signal and histogram, RSI levels and divergences), and volatility context (ATR levels, recent volatility swings).
- Trade-contextual interpretations: when to consider entries, exits, and risk adjustments given the alignment or misalignment of indicators.
- A concise set of actionable signals derived from the indicators, including caveats for noisy or sideways markets.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the indicators, what they measure, and how to interpret typical setups.

Next steps
- Retry data retrieval (get_YFin_data) for AAPL with a valid data path, or provide the CSV, and I’ll run the 8 indicators and generate the full report.
- If you prefer, I can retry with a narrower date range (e.g., last 6–12 months) to reduce data volume and potential issues, once the data source is accessible.
- If you want to proceed immediately without data retrieval, I can provide a hypothetical interpretation framework using these indicators, but it won’t reflect current prices until data is loaded.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer to supply the data CSV or a working data source? In the meantime, here is a ready-to-use summary of the 8 chosen indicators and their roles (for quick reference once data is loaded):

- close_50_sma: Mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend backbone; monitor for golden/death cross
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum shifts and quick entry cues
- macd: Momentum change indicators; look for line crossovers with potential trend shifts
- macds: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD for trade triggers
- macdh: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergences
- rsi: Overbought/oversold moods and divergences
- atr: Volatility measure for stop placement and risk management

Key points table
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Purpose: Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Interpretation: Price above/below suggests bullish/bearish mid-term trend; use with other signals to time entries
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark | Interpretation: Price above indicates long-term uptrend; price below suggests long-term caution
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Purpose: Short-term momentum | Interpretation: Crosses with price or longer averages signal nearby entries; susceptible to noise
- Indicator: macd | Purpose: Momentum change | Interpretation: Bullish/bearish cross indicates potential trend change; confirm with other signals
- Indicator: macds | Purpose: MACD signal line | Interpretation: Cross with MACD line to trigger signals; fewer false positives when aligned with price trend
- Indicator: macdh | Purpose: Momentum strength | Interpretation: Histogram expansion/contraction signals momentum strength; watch for divergences
- Indicator: rsi | Purpose: Overbought/oversold momentum | Interpretation: Extremes suggest reversals, but in strong trends RSI can stay extended; confirm with trend
- Indicator: atr | Purpose: Volatility/risk management | Interpretation: Higher ATR means wider stops and larger potential drawdown; calibrate position sizes accordingly

Once the data path is resolved, I’ll run the indicators and give you a detailed, data-driven trend report.
