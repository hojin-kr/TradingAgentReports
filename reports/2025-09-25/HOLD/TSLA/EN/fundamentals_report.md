Thanks for the request. I attempted to pull the latest fundamental data for TSLA (Tesla, Inc.) using the provided tools, but I hit an internal error (FileNotFoundError) across all data calls. Specifically, attempts to fetch:

- Finnhub insider sentiment (past 15 days)
- Finnhub insider transactions (past 15 days)
- SimFin balance sheet (quarterly)
- SimFin cash flow (quarterly)
- SimFin income statement (quarterly)

All returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the actual numeric data to include in a detailed, data-driven report right now.

What I can do next
- Retry the data fetch now if you’d like me to try again immediately.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, methodology-focused report that describes exactly what I will extract, how I would interpret it, and what traders should watch for, once the data is available.
- Alternatively, you can provide any data you already have (e.g., key figures from the last quarterly report, or insider transaction notes), and I’ll incorporate that into a full report.

What I can deliver right now (without fresh data)
I can still lay out a comprehensive report framework and explain how each data piece would inform trading decisions once the data is retrieved. Here’s what the final report will cover, with placeholders where numbers will go:

1) Company profile and business model
- Overview of Tesla’s segments (automotive, energy generation/storage, services)
- Geographic exposure and growth drivers
- Competitive landscape and moat considerations
- Key risks (regulatory, supply chain, competition, demand sensitivity)

2) Basic company financials (historical view)
- Revenue, gross profit, operating income, EBITDA, net income
- Key margins (gross, operating, net) and any seasonality
- Cash flow characteristics: operating cash flow, capex intensity, free cash flow
- Balance sheet highlights: liquidity (cash, equivalents, revolver availability), debt levels, working capital dynamics

3) Financial history and trend analysis
- Revenue growth trajectory (telegraphed by product cycles, energy products, and regulatory incentives)
- Margin progression and cost structure evolution (COGS, SG&A, R&D)
- Capital allocation and returns to shareholders (borrowing vs. equity, buybacks, equity issuance)

4) Cash flow and profitability dynamics (SimFin data)
- Operating cash flow trends and cash conversion
- Invested capital and capex strategy
- Free cash flow generation and payout potential

5) Insider sentiment (Finnhub)
- Sentiment direction over the past 15 days and what it implies (optimism vs. caution)
- Any notable shifts around product launches, price changes, or energy division developments

6) Insider transactions (Finnhub)
- Recent insider buy/sell activity (size, timing, rationale)
- Comparison to historical insider behavior and potential signals about management conviction

7) Data interpretation and trading implications
- How the combination of revenue growth, margin trajectory, cash flow health, and balance sheet strength could influence:
  - Valuation approach (growth vs. value lens)
  - Earnings quality assessment
  - Liquidity and solvency risk under different macro scenarios
  - Sensitivity to macro factors (rates, commodity prices, consumer demand)

8) Risk factors and scenarios
- Bull, base, and bear scenarios with qualitative drivers
- Key catalysts or warnings to monitor (new models, production ramp for new platforms, energy product performance, regulatory changes)

9) Appendices
- Markdown table (to be filled with the final data)
- Data sources and definitions
- Any caveats about the data (frequency, timing, revisions)

Proposed Markdown table (structure to be populated once data is available)
- Metric
- Latest Value
- Source
- Frequency (quarterly/annual)
- Direction (beat/miss/flat) or Trend (up/down)
- Notes / interpretation

If you’d like me to proceed, please choose one:
- Retry data retrieval now (I’ll attempt the five calls again and then assemble a full, data-filled report).
- Or, provide any data you already have, and I’ll draft the complete report with those figures included.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now?
