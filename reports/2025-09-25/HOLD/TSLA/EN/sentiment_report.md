Apologies — I hit a tool error fetching Reddit stock news for TSLA.

Error: get_reddit_stock_info returned FileNotFoundError (internal tool issue).

Options:
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again and then proceed with the full TSLA social sentiment and news analysis for 2025-09-25.
- Fallback plan: I’ll proceed with a best-effort qualitative synthesis using available public signals (other social platforms, recent company news, typical sentiment drivers) and structure a detailed report. I will clearly note where the data is hand-picked vs. tool-derived.

Which would you prefer? If you’d like the full original plan (with the Markdown table at the end), I’ll retry now and then deliver the comprehensive report as soon as I have the data.
