I’m trying to analyze SPY as requested, but I’m currently unable to fetch the data due to a backend data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory) after two attempts. I can retry immediately if you’d like, or proceed with a solid planning and indicator framework you can use once the data fetch works. Please tell me which you prefer.

In the meantime, here’s a focused indicator plan tailored for SPY that provides complementary, non-redundant insights. I’ve selected 8 indicators that cover trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management to avoid overlap and give a well-rounded view.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) and rationale for SPY
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - What it provides: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why SPY: Helps identify the prevailing trend regime (bullish/bearish) and potential pullback levels in a broad market ETF.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - What it provides: Long-term trend confirmation and a reference for major trend shifts (golden/death cross context).
  - Why SPY: Useful for strategic, higher-timeframe perspective and filtering false signals from shorter-term indicators.
- close_10_ema (10-period exponential moving average)
  - What it provides: Responsive short-term momentum and quick shifts in price direction.
  - Why SPY: Helps detect near-term entry/exit points and momentum changes when combined with longer-term averages.
- macd (MACD line)
  - What it provides: Momentum across MACD line, signaling strength and potential trend changes via crossovers/divergence.
  - Why SPY: Complements price action with momentum signals, useful in trending and transitional phases.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it provides: Signal line for MACD crossovers, smoothing MACD for clearer trade signals.
  - Why SPY: Reduces false positives by requiring a MACD-cross with the signal line.
- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - What it provides: Momentum strength with overbought/oversold cues and possible divergence signals.
  - Why SPY: Helps identify extreme conditions and potential mean-reversion points, especially when aligned with trend indicators.
- boll (Bollinger Middle / 20-period SMA)
  - What it provides: Volatility-adjusted baseline; center of Bollinger Bands to gauge normal price range.
  - Why SPY: Useful for assessing breakout risk and normal price movement relative to recent volatility.
- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it provides: Actual market volatility level for risk management and position sizing.
  - Why SPY: Helps determine stop placement and how much cushion to give trades in varying volatility regimes.

What I will deliver once data can be retrieved
- A detailed, nuanced narrative of SPY’s current regime, including:
  - Trend direction and strength from the combination of moving averages (50sma, 200sma, 10 ema).
  - Momentum context from MACD and RSI, including any bullish/bearish crossovers and potential divergences.
  - Volatility and breakout context from Bollinger middle and ATR, indicating whether price is pinching, expanding, or in a breakout pattern.
  - Contextual interpretation of how these signals align or conflict (e.g., bullish price action with elevated ATR might imply higher risk or a potential continuation if MACD confirms).
  - Potential support and resistance zones synthesized from moving averages and Bollinger bands, with notes on how a break above/below these levels could evolve.
  - Practical takeaways for entries, exits, and risk management, including suggested stop placement relative to ATR and recent price structure.
- A concise, trader-friendly interpretation of current conditions (e.g., regime is in a consolidation-with-bias-to-upside, or a clear uptrend with rising volatility, etc.).
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the indicators, signals to watch, and the qualitative interpretation drivers.

Markdown table: key indicators and what to watch for SPY
- Indicator | What it signals | Typical action cue
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Look for price above/below 50SMA as trend confirmation or pullback target
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend confirmation; major regime context | Price above 200SMA suggests bullish regime; cross below may indicate risk of trend change
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum shifts | Price crossing above/below 10EMA can mark quick entry/exit points (filtered by longer-term trend)
- macd | Momentum strength and potential trend changes | MACD line crossing above/below the signal line can signal entries/exits; look for divergence with price
- macds | Smoother momentum signal | Use MACD vs. MACDS cross as a confirmation; avoid acting on MACD alone in choppy markets
- rsi | Overbought/oversold momentum; potential reversals | RSI approaching extreme levels (e.g., >70 or <30) may precede mean reversion when aligned with trend
- boll | Baseline volatility-adjusted centerline | Price interacting with the Bollinger middle line can hint at continuation or pullback; band width signals changing volatility
- atr | Current market volatility for risk management | Higher ATR suggests wider stops and larger price moves; adjust position sizing accordingly

Next steps
- I can retry retrieving SPY data right away and then generate the full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators above, followed by the detailed narrative and the Markdown table.
- Alternatively, if you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-agnostic interpretation framework now and fill in data points as soon as retrieval succeeds.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch for SPY now, or proceed with the qualitative framework while I wait for the data to come back?
