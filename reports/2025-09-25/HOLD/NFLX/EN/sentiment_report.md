Thanks for the update. I hit an internal error trying to fetch the Reddit stock info for NFLX on 2025-09-25 (FileNotFoundError). I can’t pull the Reddit data right now, but I can still move forward with a robust analysis plan and deliver a high-quality report once the data path is restored. Here are two paths and what I’ll deliver in each:

Option A: Retry data fetch and deliver a full report
- I will retry pulling Reddit stock posts for NFLX for 2025-09-25 and then synthesize:
  - Daily sentiment trends over the past week (positive/negative/neutral, major sentiment spikes, and possible drivers).
  - Top Reddit threads and themes (e.g., pricing, content slate, ad-supported tier, subscriber guidance, competition).
  - Any notable correlation between sentiment shifts and recent NFLX headlines or events.
  - A cohesive long-form report with trader-oriented insights, risk factors, and actionable takeaways.
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points and signals.

Option B: Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using available sources (no Reddit data)
- I’ll compile a comprehensive report using:
  - Public news headlines and corporate announcements about NFLX over the past week.
  - General social sentiment signals (high-level impressions from popular platforms) and potential sentiment drivers.
  - Contextual analysis of the streaming landscape (competition, pricing, content strategy) and how that might impact NFLX sentiment and price.
  - Trader-oriented takeaways, risk factors, and an actionable plan.
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points and signals.
Note: Without Reddit data, the sentiment granularity by day will be approximate, but I’ll still deliver a detailed, trader-focused analysis.

What would you prefer?
- Proceed with Option A (retry data fetch immediately and deliver the full Reddit-based report), or
- Proceed with Option B (full analysis using available sources, without Reddit data for now)?

If you’d like me to proceed with the retry, I’ll attempt again right away and then generate the full long report with the Markdown table appended. If you prefer Option B now, I’ll start on that and flag where Reddit data is missing so you know what will be updated once the tool is back.
