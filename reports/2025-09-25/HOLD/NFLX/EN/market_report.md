I tried to fetch NFLX data and run the indicator checks, but the data retrieval failed with a FileNotFoundError from the data source. I don’t have current NFLX price/indicator values to quote right now. If you’d like, I can retry once the data source is available, or proceed with a robust, forward-looking framework using the 8 selected indicators and how to interpret them once the data comes through. Below is a detailed, nuanced plan and a recommended indicator set tailored for NFLX in a typical market context.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- vwma
- atr

Why these 8 are chosen
- They cover a spectrum of insights without overlap:
  - Moving averages (10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA) provide short-, medium-, and long-term trend context and act as dynamic support/resistance levels.
  - MACD components (MACD and MACD Signal) reveal momentum shifts and potential trend changes; they’re especially useful for spotting crossovers in conjunction with price action.
  - RSI offers momentum momentum readings to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals, useful for confirming trend in strong moves.
  - VWMA adds volume-weighted price context to confirm price-driven moves with market participation.
  - ATR gauges current volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing.
- This combination emphasizes trend direction, momentum, volume confirmation, and risk control—vital for a volatile, sentiment-driven stock like NFLX.

How to interpret these indicators together for NFLX (once data is available)
- Trend framework (long-term to short-term)
  - 200 SMA: If price is above the 200 SMA, the long-term trend is considered up; if below, the long-term trend is down. Use this as the primary trend filter.
  - 50 SMA and 10 EMA: Use the 50 SMA as a medium-term trend gauge; look for price and/or the 10 EMA crossing above/below the 50 SMA for potential trend continuation or pullbacks within the established trend.
- Momentum
  - MACD and MACD Signal: Look for crossovers (MACD crossing above MACD Signal as bullish, below as bearish) and for MACD histogram behavior (increasing positive/negative momentum). Confirm with the price trend and RSI.
  - RSI: Watch for readings near extremes (e.g., above 70, below 30) and for divergences with price. In a strong uptrend, RSI can remain overbought for extended periods; cross-check with trend indicators.
- Volume and volatility
  - VWMA: Positive signals are strengthened when price rises in tandem with rising VWMA (volume-supported moves). If price advances but VWMA creeps lower, be cautious about sustainability.
  - ATR: Use ATR to gauge current volatility. Rising ATR suggests wider price swings and potentially larger stops; use ATR-based stop placements and adapt position sizes accordingly.
- Decision framework (entry/exit ideas) once data is available
  - Bullish setup (trend-confirmed environment)
    - Price above 200 SMA; 50 SMA above 200 SMA; price above 10 EMA; MACD above Signal with rising histogram; RSI not in extreme overbought territory; VWMA rising with price; ATR rising (accepting higher risk, adjust stops).
    - Potential entry: on a MACD cross above zero or a pullback test near the 10 EMA/50 SMA with price staying above the 200 SMA and VWMA confirming volume.
  - Bearish setup (downtrend environment)
    - Price below 200 SMA; 50 SMA below 200 SMA; price below 10 EMA; MACD below Signal with negative histogram; RSI showing weakness or turning down from mid-range; VWMA declining with price; ATR rising (carry higher risk, tighten stops).
    - Potential entry: on a MACD cross below zero or a pullback to resistance near the 10 EMA with volume confirmation fading.
- Risk management
  - Use ATR to set initial stops (e.g., a multiple of ATR, depending on risk tolerance and timeframe).
  - Consider VWMA-confirmed moves as higher-conviction entries; if VWMA diverges from price, be cautious.
  - Position sizing should reflect current ATR and your risk per trade.

Contextual notes for NFLX (2025 landscape)
- NFLX often moves with subscriber/add-on news, content costs, and competitive dynamics in streaming. In uptrends, valuations may remain stretched, so trend-following signals (200 SMA, MACD, VWMA) can help avoid getting caught in counter-trend pullbacks.
- In volatile periods, ATR-driven stops and volume confirmation (VWMA) are especially valuable to avoid false breakouts and whipsaws.
- RSI behavior in NFLX can be tricky in strong upswings; use it as a supplementary gauge rather than a sole trigger.

Proposed usage plan (when data is available)
- Step 1: Check long-term trend: Is price above/below 200 SMA?
- Step 2: Check medium-term trend: Is 50 SMA above/below 200 SMA? Is price above/below 50 SMA?
- Step 3: Check short-term momentum: MACD vs MACD Signal status and histogram trend; RSI level and direction.
- Step 4: Confirm with volume: VWMA direction in line with price move.
- Step 5: Assess volatility: ATR level to set stop levels and risk.
- Step 6: Form a position plan (entry, stop, target) aligned with the combined signals. Consider scaling in/out as MACD line crosses signals or RSI confirms trend reversal.

Key points at a glance (table)
- Indicator: close_10_ema | What it measures: Short-term momentum trend vs price | How to use: Watch for price crossing above/below 10 EMA as a quick momentum cue; confirm with 50 SMA and MACD.
- Indicator: close_50_sma | What it measures: Medium-term trend baseline | How to use: Use as a trend filter; trend is more reliable when price is above (bullish) or below (bearish) this level.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark | How to use: Primary trend filter; use with other signals to time entries.
- Indicator: macd | What it measures: Momentum via EMA differences | How to use: Look for crossovers with MACD Signal and histogram changes; confirm with price trend and RSI.
- Indicator: macds | What it measures: MACD signal line | How to use: Crossover with MACD line can trigger entries/exits; avoid false positives with other filters.
- Indicator: rsi | What it measures: Momentum strength over 14 periods (default) | How to use: Watch for overbought/oversold zones and divergences; use with trend context.
- Indicator: vwma | What it measures: Volume-weighted price trend | How to use: Confirm price moves with volume; rising VWMA with price adds conviction.
- Indicator: atr | What it measures: Market volatility | How to use: Set stops and position sizes; rising ATR suggests larger price swings to expect.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now or with adjusted dates. Once the data is available, I’ll generate a current, data-backed report using the 8 indicators above and provide a detailed, point-by-point analysis with concrete entry/exit ideas and a summary table of observations.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with this framework now and adapt the exact signals once the data comes through.
