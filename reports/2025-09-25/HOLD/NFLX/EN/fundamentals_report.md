I started to pull NFLX data for insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement, but all attempts returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data service or local data files are unavailable right now. I can retry shortly, or you can choose an alternative path below.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry data retrieval now: I’ll attempt to fetch all five data sources again immediately.
- Proceed with a structured outline: I’ll generate a comprehensive report framework (with detailed analysis prompts and a ready-to-fill Markdown table) that you can complete once the data sources are available.
- Switch to a different ticker or data frequency: If you want to test the workflow with another symbol or with non-quarterly data (or a different date), I can prepare that.
- Use a best-effort qualitative overview: I can provide a high-level, non-data-specific Netflix fundamental framework (key drivers, risks, and typical trader considerations) while we wait for the data to come back.

If you’d like me to retry now, I’ll proceed and report back with any data I can retrieve (or confirm persistent unavailability).

Note: The current date you provided is 2025-09-25. Once data are available, I’ll deliver a thorough fundamental report on NFLX, including:
- Company profile and business model
- Revenue/earnings/ cash flow overview from the latest quarterly data
- Balance sheet snapshot (assets, liabilities, equity) and notable changes
- Cash flow analysis (operating, investing, financing; free cash flow)
- Income statement trends (revenue growth, margins, profitability)
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days) and insider transactions (past 15 days)
- Fine-grained analysis and trader-oriented insights (risks, catalysts, thresholds)
- A concise Markdown table at the end summarizing key points

If you choose “Retry now,” I’ll run the data fetch again and then deliver the full, detailed report.
