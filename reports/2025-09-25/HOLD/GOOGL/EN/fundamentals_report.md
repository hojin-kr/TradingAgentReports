I attempted to fetch the data for GOOGL (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) but the data layer returned a FileNotFoundError. That means I can’t pull the latest figures right now, so I can’t generate the full, detailed report you asked for.

What would you like me to do next?
- Option 1: Retry fetching all five data points now (I’ll attempt parallel retrieval again and then compile the full report as soon as data comes back).
- Option 2: Proceed with a qualitative, high-level Alphabet/GOOGL fundamentals overview using published information up to today (no fresh data points from the tools), and note that missing tool data would be appended when available.
- Option 3: Try an alternative workflow (e.g., pull data in smaller batches or use a different date window) if you have a preferred timeframe.
- Option 4: Focus on a subset (e.g., insider sentiment + insider transactions only) if you want a quicker, narrower report.

If you choose to retry now, I’ll re-run the data pulls and then deliver a comprehensive report with:
- Company profile and basic financials
- Recent income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow highlights
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions for the past 15 days
- Fine-grained insights and potential trader takeaways
- A final Markdown table summarizing key points

Please let me know which option you prefer.
