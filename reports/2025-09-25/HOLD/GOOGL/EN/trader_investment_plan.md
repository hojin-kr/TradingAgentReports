Based on the provided plan and current readings, my stance aligns with Hold, complemented by a hedged/staged-entry approach to preserve optionality while limiting downside.

- Recommendation: Hold now with a structured hedging layer and staged-entry plan.
- Rationale: Near-term regulatory remedies and capex/cash-flow timing remain meaningful risks that could cap multiple expansion, even as the long-term AI/Cloud story remains intact. The upside hinges on catalysts that are not guaranteed in the near term.
- Hedging approach (optional templates you can use):
  - Collars (6–12 months): Buy protective puts ~5–10% OTM and finance with short-dated calls slightly OTM. Caps upside but reduces downside.
  - Alternative: Purchase longer-dated puts (6–12 months) at a strike ~5–10% below current price to maintain upside exposure while limiting downside.
- Entry/exit triggers:
  - Consider small add-ons if the price stays above key moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day) with constructive momentum and no worsening regulatory headlines.
  - Tighten stops and/or increase hedges if price breaks below confluence support (e.g., breach of both 50-day and 200-day with rising volume) or if a major regulatory development signals a harsher path.
- Catalysts to monitor:
  - Regulatory: DoJ/EU developments, potential remedies or governance changes.
  - Ad-market: CPM trends, YouTube monetization mix, ARPU shifts.
  - AI/Cloud: Enterprise adoption signals, utilization, and gross margin trajectory.
  - Capex/news flow: Data-center spend, buildouts, delays, or overruns.
- Risk controls and review cadence:
  - Establish explicit stop levels and a monthly review cadence to recalibrate stance as catalysts evolve.

If you’d like, I can run a current data snapshot to tailor the exact hedge parameters (put strikes, timing) and refine precise price-trigger levels based on live readings.

Bottom line
- Verdict: Hold with a hedged, staged-entry plan.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
