I attempted to fetch META data and the selected indicators, but the data retrieval system returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a temporary environment issue. I can retry the data pull now, or proceed with a detailed, framework-based analysis you can use once the data loads. Let me know if you want me to retry immediately. In the meantime, here is a carefully curated indicator set and a deep-dive framework tailored for META as of 2025-09-25.

Selected indicators (up to 8) and rationale
- close_50_sma
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the prevailing trend when combined with longer-timeframe signals.
- close_200_sma
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for identifying golden/death-cross setups and overall market stance (bullish/bearish trend) for META.
- close_10_ema
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum signal. Helps detect quick shifts and potential entry points, especially in choppy markets when paired with longer averages.
- macd
  - Why: Core momentum indicator. Crossovers with the MACD line indicate potential trend changes; useful to confirm with other signals in low-volatility or sideways conditions.
- macdh
  - Why: Momentum strength visualization via histogram. Divergence and histogram growth/shrinkage help gauge the tempo of the move and potential exhaustion.
- rsi
  - Why: Momentum/overbought-oversold context. Complements trend signals; watch for divergences and 70/30-like thresholds with respect to the trend.
- boll
  - Why: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a dynamic volatility benchmark. Combined with upper/lower bands, it helps identify breakout zones vs. reversals and how price interacts with volatility envelopes.
- atr
  - Why: Practical volatility/risk management tool. Sets stop-loss levels and position sizing adjustments based on current market volatility, which is crucial for META’s often volatile price moves.

Note on redundancy
- I avoided including all three MACD components (macd, macds, macdh) if signals become too overlapping. The chosen set includes macd and macdh to capture both the MACD momentum signal and its magnitude, while keeping the set compact and complementary with the other indicators.

What to look for once data is available (detailed framework)
- Trend alignment check (long-term vs. short-term)
  - Price above 200 SMA and 50 SMA: overall bullish alignment; look for pullbacks to the 50 SMA for potential entries if momentum confirms.
  - Price below 200 SMA or 50 SMA: bearish or range-bound context; prefer confluence with other signals before taking long positions.
- Short-term momentum
  - Price crossing above 10 EMA while MACD line crosses above the signal line and MACDH turns positive: supportive for a near-term upside move.
  - If MACD histogram is rising while price tests resistance near the upper Bollinger band and RSI holds above 50 but below 70: consider a cautious long with clear risk controls.
- Momentum vs. momentum exhaustion
  - RSI rising toward overbought levels (near 70) in a strong uptrend can be acceptable if price is riding the upper Bollinger band and ATR is expanding (higher volatility). If RSI diverges downward while price keeps rising, be cautious of a potential reversal.
- Volatility and breakout context
  - Price touching or breaking the Bollinger upper band with rising ATR signals potential breakouts in a high-variance environment. Look for MACD confirmation and a positive MACD histogram to back the breakout.
  - Price riding the Bollinger bands in a sideways or choppy regime might indicate exhaustion; use ATR to adjust position sizing and risk.
- Risk management and position sizing
  - Use ATR to set stop-loss distances (e.g., 1.0–2.0 ATR away from entry, depending on risk tolerance).
  - Consider narrowing stops during low-volatility phases and widening during high-ATR days to avoid premature exits or overexposure.
- Divergence considerations
  - RSI divergences with price highs/lows can precede reversals, especially when the MACD histogram shows weakening momentum. Use MACD crossovers as additional confirmation rather than sole signals in divergence scenarios.

Operational notes
- Once the data retrieval issue is resolved, I’ll pull the latest META price history (2024-09-25 to 2025-09-25) and generate the indicator values for the eight chosen signals. I’ll then provide:
  - A detailed trends-and-moments narrative (granular, not just “up/down/mixed”).
  - Specific entry/exit scenarios aligned with a practical trading framework.
  - A concise trade setup checklist you can apply in real time.
  - A risk-management plan with ATR-based stop placement and position sizing.

If you’d like me to retry fetching the data now, I can do that as soon as you confirm. In the meantime, here is a compact, trader-ready interpretation guide for META using the chosen indicator set (no data-dependent numbers yet).

Trading framework outline (ready-to-use)
- Entry candidates:
  - Bullish scenario: price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA; price above 10 EMA; MACD crosses up with positive MACD histogram; RSI above 50 but not extreme; price closes above upper Bollinger band or near it with rising ATR.
  - Bearish scenario: price below 50 SMA and 200 SMA; price below 10 EMA; MACD crosses down; RSI below 50 and trending lower; price tests lower Bollinger band with rising ATR.
- Exit / risk controls:
  - Use ATR-based stops (e.g., stop at entry +/- 1.0–1.5 ATR) and adjust to market regime.
  - Take partial profits near key resistance levels (dynamic via SMA interplay) or near the upper Bollinger band in uptrends.
  - If MACD histogram shows shrinking momentum while price hits a key SMA or the RSI nears overbought territory in an uptrend, consider tightening stops or taking profits.
- Contextual checks:
  - Verify trend through 50/200 SMA orientation before acting.
  - Confirm momentum with MACD and MACDH in the same direction as the price move.
  - Validate volatility context with ATR and Bollinger bands to avoid entering in choppy, low-clarity regimes.

Proposed next step
- If you want, I can retry the data pull immediately to generate a data-driven, trend-specific report for META with precise values and signals. Please confirm, and I’ll run the data fetch and deliver a detailed, data-backed analysis (with the 8-indicator setup and an actionable trading plan) as soon as the data is retrieved.
