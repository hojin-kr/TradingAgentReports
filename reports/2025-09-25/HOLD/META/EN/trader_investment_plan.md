Decision: Hold META now.

Rationale:
- The proposed investment plan for META advocates a Hold stance due to near-term uncertainty around AI monetization milestones, ad-cycle risk, regulatory costs, and capex-driven margin pressure. While the long-term AI/multi-revenue thesis remains intact, there’s not yet concrete, repeatable evidence to justify upgrading to Buy.
- Bear themes (regulatory costs, near-term ad softness, and uncertain AR/VR monetization) are non-trivial and plausible, so a cautious stance is warranted until tangible milestones are demonstrated.
- Data gaps (eight-indicator framework and sentiment feeds) add to the prudence. If/when data resumes and shows clear monetization traction and improving margins, a shift to Buy could be warranted.

What would trigger an upgrade to Buy:
- Concrete, repeatable AI-driven monetization milestones with recurring revenue and improving ARPU.
- Demonstrable margin expansion tied to AI workloads and data-center efficiency, plus clearer enterprise/government revenue visibility with defined renewals.
- Regulatory clarity or favorable policy developments that reduce cost/drag and capex cadence.
- Positive price-action with sustained momentum (e.g., broader trend breakout, rising MACD/histogram, higher RSI) aligned with catalysts.

What would prompt a downgrade or trim:
- No evidence of near-term monetization traction or worsening ad-cycle indicators.
- Rising capex costs without corresponding margin improvement; deteriorating data-center economics.
- Regulatory or policy developments that meaningfully increase costs or constrain monetization.
- Break of key support or deteriorating momentum signals without constructive catalysts.

Strategic actions now:
- Maintain modest exposure; avoid aggressive adds until catalysts appear.
- Use ATR-based stops to manage risk; consider hedges or collars if volatility spikes.
- Weekly watch on AI monetization milestones, recurring revenue indicators, and regulatory updates; readiness to adjust stance within 4–8 weeks as new data arrives.

Final thoughts:
- The plan’s balanced view remains valid: the long-term potential is compelling, but near-term catalysts aren’t proven yet. Stay patient, monitor the milestones, and be prepared to upgrade to Buy only on clear, repeatable monetization signals and durable margin improvement.
