Update: I attempted to fetch META Reddit sentiment for multiple dates (2025-09-25 through 2025-09-18) using the get_reddit_stock_info tool, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t retrieve the Reddit data for META right now. I can either retry later or switch to an alternative data source if you approve.

What I can do now
- Retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool environment is available again.
- Proceed with a comprehensive analysis plan and a structured report using placeholder data until the tool is accessible, then fill in the actual sentiment figures.
- If you have a preferred alternative data source (e.g., another social platform or a CSV you can share), you can provide it and I’ll incorporate it.

Here’s a detailed plan and a ready-to-fill report framework you can use. Once the data retrieval works, I’ll populate all sections and append a final Markdown table with key points.

Comprehensive long report structure (META)

1) Executive Summary
- High-level sentiment takeaway over the past week
- Notable shifts in mood (bullish vs bearish) and any clear catalysts
- Implications for traders (entry/exit pressure, potential risk events)

2) Daily Sentiment Narrative (past 7 days)
- For each date: Net sentiment (positive/neutral/negative), volume of posts, dominant themes, and any standout posts or memes
- Notable spikes and potential drivers (product announcements, earnings whispers, regulatory news, ad market signals)

3) Top Themes & Sentiment Drivers
- Product and Platform: Meta’s apps, AI features, advertising platform updates, metaverse signals
- Financial/Monetization: Ad revenue trajectory, cost controls, guidance updates if any, AI monetization
- Regulation & Governance: Privacy scrutiny, regulatory investigations, antitrust considerations
- Competition & Market Position: Meta vs. peers (Google/Alphabet, TikTok, X), user growth, engagement trends
- Earnings Expectations: Sentiment ahead of any earnings or financial updates

4) Notable Posts & Community Pulse
- Representative examples of posts with sentiment polarity (positive/negative) and why they matter
- Any recurring memes or narratives (e.g., AI features, privacy, data usage)

5) News Alignment & External Signals
- Cross-reference with recent company news (press releases, regulatory filings, product launches)
- How the sentiment aligns or diverges from the news cycle
- Any lag between news events and sentiment shifts

6) Risk Assessment & Sentiment-T-driven Scenarios
- Bullish scenario: what sentiment supports a cheer, how long it could last, and potential catalysts
- Bearish scenario: what sentiment signals risk, weakness to monitor, and potential trigger events
- Neutral/Range-bound scenario: what remains in the balance to create a trading range

7) Implications for Traders and Investors
- Short-term vs. longer-term sentiment implications
- Positioning ideas (entry/exit/size, hedges, options angles) aligned with sentiment trajectories
- Key risk controls (watchlist triggers, stop levels, volatility considerations)

8) Data Gaps & Limitations
- Notes about data coverage, potential biases in social sentiment data
- Confidence level and any caveats for decision-making

9) Actionable Takeaways
- A concise list of 3–6 concrete insights for traders (e.g., “If sentiment shifts to predominantly negative with rising volume, consider protective hedges”)

10) Markdown Table: Key Points Snapshot
- A compact, readable table that captures the day-by-day sentiment, themes, and immediate implications.

Suggested Markdown table format (to be populated after data is available)
- Date | Net Sentiment | Post Volume | Dominant Theme(s) | Notable Posts/Examples | News Alignment | Implication for Traders
- 2025-09-25 | Positive/Neutral/Negative | X posts | Theme A; Theme B | Quote or summary of notable post | Aligns/ contradicts news on X | Trading signal or caution

What I need from you to proceed efficiently
- Confirm if you’d like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll attempt again as soon as the tool is available).
- Or, approve switching to an alternative data source you prefer (and provide access if needed), so I can proceed with a sentiment-and-news integrated report.
- If you have any specific dates to emphasize or particular themes you care about (e.g., AI monetization, regulatory risk), tell me and I’ll prioritize them in the analysis.

Once the data retrieval succeeds (or you provide an alternative data source), I’ll produce:
- A full, detailed report with granular day-by-day sentiment and theme analysis
- A synthesized set of trader-oriented takeaways and risk factors
- A final Markdown table summarizing the key points for quick reference

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with an alternative data source?
