I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock info for PLTR on 2025-09-25, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a runtime issue with the data source, so I can’t pull the latest Reddit sentiment data right now.

Here are two ways we can proceed. please pick one:

- Option A: Retry data fetch now
  - I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again immediately and, if successful, I’ll produce a comprehensive long report detailing:
    - Daily sentiment trends on PLTR over the past week from Reddit
    - Key themes in posts (risk/concerns, catalysts, product/news mentions)
    - How sentiment aligns with recent company news and events
    - Trader implications and potential levels to watch
    - A final Markdown table summarizing key points

- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort, non-Reddit data-backed analysis
  - I’ll compile a thorough PLTR report using publicly available news sources and sentiment proxies (press releases, major news outlets, typical social chatter patterns) for the past week, clearly noting data sources and limitations. This will still include:
    - Summary of major news events (earnings, partnerships, product updates)
    - Public sentiment framing (tone shifts around key catalysts)
    - Trader implications and risk factors
    - A Markdown table of key points

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want Option A, I’ll retry the Reddit pull right away. If you want Option B, I’ll proceed with the best available sources immediately.
