I attempted to fetch PLTR data and run the selected indicators, but the data calls returned a FileNotFoundError (environment issue: missing files). The parallel calls for the indicators also failed for the same reason. I can retry fetching the data or adjust the workflow (e.g., try again in a few minutes or use a backup data source). In the meantime, I’ve prepared a robust set of indicators and a detailed interpretive framework you can use once the data is available.

Selected indicators (8 total) with rationale for PLTR
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (medium-term trend)
  - Why it matters: Offers a dynamic view of the mid-term trend and can act as support/resistance. Useful for filtering misreads from shorter-term signals.
  - How to use: If price sits above 50SMA and holds, that supports a bullish tilt; pullbacks toward 50SMA can be potential entry zones in uptrends.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (long-term trend)
  - Why it matters: Serves as a long-run trend benchmark and helps identify regime changes (golden/death cross signals with shorter MA).
  - How to use: Confirm trend direction. A sustained move above 200SMA supports a constructive long-term view; a break below can warn of longer-term weakness.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages (short-term momentum)
  - Why it matters: Captures quick momentum shifts and potential entry points in choppier price action.
  - How to use: When price and 10-EMA slope align with higher-timeframe trend, it strengthens a timely entry or exit signal; be cautious in congested ranges.

- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why it matters: Core momentum signal; crossovers and convergence/divergence can precede trend changes.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossing above/below zero and crossovers with the signal line as potential signals, especially when confirmed by higher-timeframe trend.

- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why it matters: MACD histogram shows momentum strength and shifts; helps spot divergence earlier than price.
  - How to use: Rising histogram supports bullish momentum; contracting/negative histogram can precede pullbacks or reversals when paired with price action.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Why it matters: Momentum gauge with classic overbought/oversold thresholds; can reveal divergences against price trends.
  - How to use: RSI above 70 hints at overbought risk in uptrends (watch for weakening momentum), while RSI below 30 signals oversold risk during downtrends. Look for bullish/bearish divergences to anticipate reversals, corroborating trend context from moving averages.

- boll_ub
  - Category: Volatility Indicators (upper Bollinger Band)
  - Why it matters: Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones; price interaction with the upper band can indicate regime shifts in strong moves.
  - How to use: Consider breakouts above the upper band as potential continuation signals in uptrends, but confirm with other tools to avoid overextended buys.

- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Why it matters: Measures average true range to gauge volatility magnitude; essential for sizing and stop placement.
  - How to use: Use ATR to set dynamic stops and position sizing; higher ATR suggests wider stops and potentially larger position sizing if risk is managed.

Contextual notes for PLTR (based on typical patterns around this stock in late 2024–2025)
- PLTR has shown episodic volatility driven by growth expectations, data/AI-related developments, and broader tech-sector earnings sentiment. A diversified signal set like the one above helps you:
  - Filter trend direction (50SMA/200SMA) from timing (10-EMA) in a stock that can swing between confirmation moves and fast momentum shifts.
  - Gauge momentum strength (MACD/macdH, RSI) while being mindful of regime where RSI can linger in overbought zones during sustained up moves.
  - Detect volatility regimes (ATR) and potential breakout zones (boll_ub), which can inform trade timing and risk management.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now or on your command. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry the data fetch for PLTR with the same date range.
  - Narrow or adjust the date range (e.g., last 12–18 months) to ensure data availability.
  - Switch to a backup data source if you have a preferred feed.

Proposed format for action
- If you want me to proceed with live interpretation once data is available, say: “Retry data fetch for PLTR” or specify a date window.
- If you want to adjust the indicator set, tell me which indicators to add/remove (keeping within the 8-indicator limit).

Appendix: quick reference table of indicators
| Indicator | Category | Role / What it tells you | How to use for PLTR |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Trend direction and pullback zones; use with price action |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirm regime; watch for golden/death cross signals with shorter MA |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Timely entry/exit signals; filter with longer TA in choppy markets |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum trend changes; crossovers/divergence | Crossover/zero-line signals; corroborate with higher TF trend |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength; histogram-based signals | Momentum strength; watch for divergence paired with price action |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum magnitude; overbought/oversold; divergences | 70/30 levels; watch for divergences in context of trend |
| boll_ub | Volatility Indicators | Overbought/ breakout zone signals | Breakouts above upper band with confirmation; use with other signals |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility magnitude; risk management | Dynamic stops/position sizing; adjust risk with volatility regime |

If you want me to retry data retrieval now, just say the word and I’ll attempt again.
