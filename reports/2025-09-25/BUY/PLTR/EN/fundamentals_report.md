I attempted to fetch the latest insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financials for PLTR, but I’m hitting an internal file-not-found error from the data tools. This prevents me from returning the detailed data-driven report right now.

What I can do next
- I can retry the data pulls immediately, or at a time you specify, to re-run:
  - Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - SimFin balance sheet (quarterly)
  - SimFin cash flow (quarterly)
  - SimFin income statement (quarterly)
- If you’d like, I can also proceed with a qualitative, data-agnostic fundamental overview of PLTR in the meantime, outlining what to look for once the data comes back.
- I can prepare the structure of the full report (with a Markdown table at the end) so that once the data is retrieved I can fill it in quickly.

Proposed plan and deliverable structure (to be filled with data when available)
- Company profile and business model
  - What PLTR does, revenue streams (government vs. commercial), product platforms (e.g., Gotham, Foundry), and key customers.
- Financial snapshot (latest quarter)
  - Income statement highlights: revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS.
  - Balance sheet highlights: cash & equivalents, working capital, total debt, equity.
  - Cash flow highlights: operating cash flow, investing cash flow, financing cash flow, free cash flow.
- Trend analysis (historical context)
  - Revenue growth, margin trends, profitability trajectory, cash flow evolution, balance sheet strength.
  - Any notable shifts in capex intensity or working capital profile.
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions
  - Recent sentiment direction, notable buys/sells, potential implications for management confidence.
- Fundamental insights for traders
  - Catalysts (product launches, government demand trends, renewals, government funding cycles).
  - Risks (regulatory exposure, customer concentration, government contract exposure, competition, profitability path to FCF positive).
  - Key metrics to watch (FCF margin, operating cash flow trend, debt levels, liquidity ratios, valuation context).
- Summary and actionable takeaways
  - Practical implications for different trading styles (long-term investment vs. event-driven trading vs. swing trading).

Dash-ready Markdown table (to fill after data is back)
- A concise table at the end with columns such as:
  - Item
  - Latest Quarter / Date
  - YoY / QoQ Change
  - Key Observations
  - Trader Implications
  - Data Source (Income Statement / Balance Sheet / Cash Flow / Insider)

Questions to proceed
- Do you want me to retry data retrieval now, or would you prefer I wait a bit and try again later?
- If you have a preferred curr_date (e.g., end of the latest quarter vs. a specific date), let me know.
- Should I proceed with the qualitative PLTR overview in parallel, or wait for the numerical data to populate the full report?

If you’d like me to retry immediately, I’ll kick off the data pulls again as soon as the tool suite is available and then deliver a comprehensive, data-backed PLTR fundamental report with the requested Markdown table appended.
