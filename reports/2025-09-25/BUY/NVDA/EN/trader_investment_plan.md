Decision: Buy

Rationale and alignment with the proposed plan
- The bull thesis remains compelling: durable, multi-year AI infrastructure demand supported by hyperscalers and a broad CUDA software moat that drives sticky, high-margin revenue. This creates a scalable path for sustained upside beyond a single cycle.
- Nvidia’s ecosystem effects (CUDA, software libraries, developer network) provide defensible differentiation and increasing marginal profitability as compute ramps. The diversification across regions and workloads lowers single-market risk.
- The catalyst set described in the plan (OpenAI-like demand ramps, hyperscaler capex, international data-center deployments) offers multiple levers for upside, reducing reliance on a single event.
- Risk controls are well-structured in the plan: a breakout-based entry above 184 on strong volume, with a disciplined stop near 170–172, plus optional hedging (collar or long/short call spreads) to limit downside and cap cost.
- Valuation and macro/regulatory risks are non-trivial, but they are addressable with defined entry rules, risk caps, and staged exposure growth as the trend proves itself through price action and volume.

Recommended execution (practical steps)
- Entry trigger: Initiate a core long only upon a confirmed breakout above 184 on high volume. This is the primary signal to begin sizing.
- Initial sizing: Target a modest core exposure around 1.5–2% of the portfolio. If uptrends persist, consider scaling (subject to risk limits and liquidity).
- Stop and risk guardrails: Place an initial protective stop at 170–172. If price breaks below this zone, reassess quickly and consider reducing exposure or hedging.
- Optional risk-reducing structures:
  - Cost-controlled upside participation: buy a near-term/next-month call spread (for example, long 185+ strike call, short a higher strike call such as 195–200) to capture upside with limited net premium.
  - Collars: long NVDA stock, long put protection around 170–172, financed by selling a higher-strike call to offset cost.
- Ongoing risk management and monitoring:
  - If momentum falters or price fails to hold above 184 with solid volume, be prepared to trim or hedge before a larger drawdown.
  - Maintain a diversified AI exposure to avoid single-name concentration risk.
- Timeline and review:
  - Week 0–1: Enter on breakout; set 170–172 stop; consider collar or call spread to control cost.
  - Week 2–8: Look for follow-through days; consider adding on dips toward 180–182 if setup remains constructive.
  - Week 8–12+: Reassess against regulatory or macro shifts; scale or trim based on sustained momentum and valuation comfort.
  - Quarterly: Revisit Signal quality with updated AI adoption signals, capex cadence, and regional/regulatory developments; adjust exposure if multi-quarter growth shows signs of deceleration or valuation becomes punitive.

Lessons applied
- Avoid reliance on a single catalyst or headline; use a multi-signal, multi-regime framework with defined exits.
- Do not chase breakouts without confirmation; require volume and follow-through to avoid false breakouts.
- Employ disciplined sizing and hedges to bound downside in high-valuation names tied to hype.
- Run scenario stress tests against OpenAI-like ramps, slower ramps, and regulatory/regional shocks to keep the thesis credible across regimes.

Final note
- This recommendation reflects a structured, risk-controlled application of the provided plan. If you prefer a more aggressive path (pure stock vs. option-only) or a different risk tolerance, I can tailor the execution to fit.
