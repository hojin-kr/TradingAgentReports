Thanks for the steer. I attempted to fetch NVDA Reddit stock news for 2025-09-25, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal data source issue). It looks like the Reddit data source is currently unavailable.

Options:
- I can retry the Reddit data pull right away and proceed with the full, Reddit-sentiment-based report as soon as it returns.
- Or I can move forward now with a high-quality analysis using available public news and sentiment signals from other sources (earnings, press releases, market coverage) and clearly note the limitations due to the missing Reddit data this week. I will still deliver a detailed, trader-oriented report with fine-grained insights and a final Markdown table.

Please tell me which path you prefer. If you’d like me to proceed now without Reddit data, I’ll:
- Compile a comprehensive NVDA analysis focusing on: recent company news (earnings, product/AI announcements, partnerships), supply/demand dynamics for GPUs and AI hardware, macro drivers (AI adoption trends, data-center capex), and sentiment drivers from alternative sources (news, social posts outside Reddit, analyst notes) with explicit caveats.
- Break down day-by-day sentiment signals on the data we can access, highlight key catalysts over the past week, and quantify potential implications for traders (risk, setup, and volatility considerations).
- End with a structured Markdown table summarizing key points, catalysts, risk factors, and actionable takeaways.

If you prefer, I can also attempt the Reddit pull again now and report back as soon as I have results.
