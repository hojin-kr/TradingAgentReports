I attempted to fetch the SimFin income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, and Finnhub insider sentiment/transactions for AMD as of 2025-09-25, but the tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError. I don’t have data to include yet from those sources. I can retry the data retrieval now, or proceed with a qualitative, write-up-style report based on the most recent public fundamentals I can reference from memory (not ideal for a “past week” focus). Please choose one:

- Retry data retrieval now (I’ll run the tools again and incorporate the actual figures).
- Proceed with a comprehensive qualitative report (no new data fetch; I’ll outline and interpret what to look for and provide a structured template you can fill once data arrives).

In the meantime, here is a ready-to-fill structure for your AMD fundamental report, with clear sections and the kinds of data you’ll want to populate from the fetched sources. I’ve also included a Markdown table template at the end to organize key points.

Comprehensive AMD Fundamental Report (structure)

- Cash generation: FCF yield, balance sheet strength, capital allocation discipline.
- Leverage and liquidity: debt levels, financing flexibility, liquidity runway in downturn scenarios.
- Market and product-cycle risks: PC gaming demand, data center AI workloads, AI accelerator demand, supply constraints or semiconductor cycle.

7) Catalyst and risk assessment for traders
- Short-term catalysts: product launches, AI adoption milestones, data center demand updates, guidance revisions.
- Long-term catalysts: AI compute growth, NVIDIA/AMD competitive positioning, foundry/ fabric strategy changes.
- Key risks: semis cyclicality, supply/demand imbalances, pricing pressure, FX impacts, customer concentration, valuation risk.

8) Market-on-close and qualitative takeaways

What I can do next
- Option A: Retry data retrieval now and then deliver a fully populated report with numbers, ratios, and interpretation.
- Option B: Proceed with the qualitative framework immediately (no new data), and I’ll place placeholders where numbers will go once data is fetched, so you can fill them in quickly after the retry.

Please tell me whether you want me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with Option B (qualitative framework). If you want a retry, I’ll run the tool calls again right away and incorporate the actual figures into the sections above.
