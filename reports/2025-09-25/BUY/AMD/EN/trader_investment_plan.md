Verdict: Buy AMD with a disciplined, staged plan that accounts for both the multi-year AI tailwinds and near-term execution/macroeconomic risks.

Key rationale
- Bull case alignment: Durable AI demand supports a platform-wide growth narrative (CPU + GPU + ROCm ecosystem) with meaningful optionality from software monetization and buybacks.
- Risk balance: Nvidia’s moat, ROCm adoption pace, and macro cyclical sensitivity remain real headwinds; progress in data-center AI ramp and margin mix is essential to unlock upside.
- Plan-driven approach: The proposed core position plus measured add-ons on validated catalysts helps mitigate timing risk while preserving upside.

Execution plan (concise)
- Positioning
  - If not already long, establish a core AMD position representing roughly 1.5–3% of the portfolio.
  - Plan incremental add-ons of 0.5–1.0% on confirmed catalysts or 5–10% pullbacks, provided fundamentals hold.
- Entry/add-on triggers
  - Core entry: during favorable market backdrop with in-range valuation and no deteriorating fundamental signals.
  - Add-ons: evidence of data-center AI ramp (accelerating GPU mix), improving gross margins from mix, or credible ROCm/adoption progress.
- Risk controls
  - Stop loss: around 15–20% below average entry price to protect against sharp downside.
  - Optional hedge: consider a modest protective put or a defined-risk upside strategy for limited downside while maintaining upside participation.
  - Review cadence: quarterly checks aligned with earnings and key product/partnership milestones.
- Catalysts to watch
  - Data-center revenue growth/mix shifts toward GPUs, margin trajectory improvements, ROCm adoption metrics, and enterprise monetization from partnerships (e.g., Cohere/North).
  - Macro indicators: cloud capex cycles, hyperscaler budgets, and broader semis demand signals.
- Time horizon and exit
  - Time horizon: roughly 12–24 months for meaningful data-center AI ramp and software monetization to materialize.
  - Exit criteria: trim/exit if data-center growth stalls for two consecutive quarters, gross margin remains weak or deteriorates, or milestones miss expectations and valuation re-prices downward.
- Learning from past decisions
  - Emphasize diversification across AI, platform, and software rather than chasing a single catalyst.
  - Value software/eco momentum as a core driver, not just hardware cycles.
  - Maintain cash-flow resilience to endure volatility and fund opportunistic pauses.

If you want, I can tailor this further to your exact portfolio size, risk tolerance, or a tighter 30-day catalyst window (earnings or a specific partnership milestone) and provide a quick “bear vs bull” prompt list for due-diligence conversations.
