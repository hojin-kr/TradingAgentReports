Thanks for the request. I attempted to fetch AMD data to compute the indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError (likely an environment issue with the data source). I can’t generate the live trend report without the price data. Here’s what I can do right now, plus a clear plan for moving forward.

What I can provide now
- A recommended set of up to 8 complementary indicators (non-redundant) tailored for a typical AMD context in 2024–2025 market conditions.
- Rationale for each indicator and how they would interact to provide a nuanced view of trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management.
- A detailed outline of how I will interpret the signals once data is available, plus a ready-to-use Markdown table to summarize key points.

Recommended 8 indicators for AMD (diverse, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it provides: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why for AMD: Helpful to gauge the mid-term trend in a volatile chip-name environment where price can revert to a trend line after spikes.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it provides: Long-term trend benchmark; confirms overall market regime.
  - Why for AMD: Useful to distinguish secular uptrends from bear markets; helps validate long-term bias (e.g., post-Golden Cross scenarios).
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it provides: Responsive short-term momentum; quick signals.
  - Why for AMD: Captures early shifts around earnings cycles, supply/demand news, or AI/compute cycle dynamics; should be filtered with longer-term averages to avoid noise.
- macd (MACD Related)
  - What it provides: Momentum/color of trend via the MACD line relative to the signal line.
  - Why for AMD: Useful for identifying trend changes and momentum buildups around earnings or demand shifts.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it provides: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers help confirm entries/exits.
  - Why for AMD: Reduces false positives when used with price action and other filters (e.g., moving averages).
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it provides: Momentum strength and divergence signals via the gap between MACD and signal.
  - Why for AMD: Divergence between price and MACD histogram can hint at hidden reversals or accelerations, especially in high-volatility tech cycles.
- rsi (Momentum Indicator)
  - What it provides: Relative strength momentum; overbought/oversold conditions; potential reversals.
  - Why for AMD: In a strong uptrend, RSI can stay elevated; in a choppy market it helps flag exhaustion or pullbacks when combined with trend signals.
- atr (Volatility Indicator)
  - What it provides: Average true range; current volatility level informs risk management.
  - Why for AMD: AMD tends to experience sharp moves around earnings, product cycles, and AI demand shifts. ATR helps size positions and set stops accordingly.

How the signals would be interpreted (with data in hand)
- Trend confirmation: Look for the price relative to 50_sma and 200_sma. A price above both with a bullish cross (50_sma above 200_sma) would support a bullish stance; a break below could indicate risk. Use 10_ema for quicker entry/exit timing.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD, MACDS, and MACDH should align with the trend. For example, price above 50_sma and MACD line crossing above the signal line with a rising MACDH histogram would confirm bullish momentum. Divergences between price and MACD histogram would warrant caution.
- Overextension risk: RSI readings near or above 70 (overbought) or below 30 (oversold) should be weighed against the prevailing trend. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated; use it in combination with MACD and moving averages to avoid premature exits/entries.
- Volatility context: ATR rising suggests wider price swings; consider wider stops and/or position sizing. A rising ATR in tandem with strong bullish signals from MACD/rsi can imply potential for sustained moves, but with higher risk.
- Contextual considerations for AMD: AMD often experiences sharp moves around earnings and AI/compute demand news. Use the ATR to manage risk around this event-driven volatility and rely on MACD/rsi across the trend backdrop (50/200 SMA) to time entries more robustly.

Next steps to deliver the full, data-driven report
- I will re-run data fetch (get_YFin_data) for AMD for a suitable window (e.g., 2024-09-25 to 2025-09-25 or a shorter window like 1 year ending today) and then compute the 8 indicators listed above using get_stockstats_indicators_report.
- I will generate a detailed narrative describing trend, momentum, volatility, and key divergences; include actionable insights (potential entries/exits, risk controls, and scenarios).
- I will append a Markdown table summarizing the indicators, interpretations, and signals tailored to AMD, plus a concise set of trading considerations.

Would you like me to try the data fetch again now, possibly with a shorter window (e.g., last 12 months), or should I proceed with the plan to retry once the environment is ready? If you have an alternate data source or a preferred date range, tell me and I’ll adapt.

Proposed Markdown table to include in the final report
- I will populate this table after data is retrieved. For now, here is the structure I will use:

| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret (AMD context) | Signals to watch | Potential trading implication |
|-----------|----------|------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Mid-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above: bullish medium-term trend; price below: bearish; cross with price action matters | Crosses, hold above/below, interaction with price | Trend alignment or reversal cues; informs entry/exit timing |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above: long-term bullish bias; price below: long-term bearish bias | Golden cross (50sma crossing above 200sma) or death cross | Strategic bias; suggests longer-term positions or risk for drawdown |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price above: short-term strength; price below: weakness; sensitive to noise | Quick momentum shifts, cross with 50_sma | Entry/exit timing; supports or contradicts longer-term trend |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via MACD line vs signal | MACD above signal and rising: bullish momentum; below: bearish | MACD/Signal cross, histogram changes | Confirm direction and momentum; reduces false positives if aligned with price trend |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing MACD line | Cross with MACD line confirms momentum change | MACD vs MACDS cross signals | Entry/exit timing; filter for robustness |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength/divergence | Positive histogram: strengthening momentum; negative: weakening | Divergences with price; histogram expansion/contraction | Early momentum signals; risk management cues |
| rsi | Momentum Indicator | Momentum scale; overbought/oversold | RSI > 70: overbought; RSI < 30: oversold; watch for divergences | Divergence with price; recross of thresholds | Reversals vs trend continuation; helps with risk levels |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level | Rising ATR: higher volatility; falling ATR: lower | Volatility shifts around key events | Adjust risk, stops, and position sizing; avoid overleveraged entries in high volatility |

Important note
- The exact signals will depend on the actual data. Once I have the data, I will fill in the narrative with precise observations (trend direction, crossovers, divergences, and volatility context) and provide concrete entry/exit or risk management recommendations for AMD.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry data fetch with a new window (specify dates), or
- Use an alternative data source if you have one, or
- Proceed with the plan once the data environment is ready.
