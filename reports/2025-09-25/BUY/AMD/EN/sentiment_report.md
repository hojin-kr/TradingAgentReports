Thanks for trying. I attempted to fetch Reddit stock sentiment for AMD on 2025-09-25, but the Reddit data tool is returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can’t pull the live social-media sentiment data right now through that channel.

What I can do right now
- Provide a detailed plan and a ready-to-fill template for the long-form report, so once the data tool is working again (or you provide alternative sources), I can drop in the numbers and write up the full analysis quickly.
- Start with a high-quality, data-informed framework based on known drivers for AMD (AI/Datacenter demand, GPU supply/demand cycles, gaming GPU pricing, Ryzen/CPU strength, competitive dynamics with Nvidia/Intel, and any notable product/news signals) and lay out the implications for traders.

Proposed plan for the AMD social media + news analysis
1) Snapshot and framing
   - What has been driving sentiment around AMD this past week (e.g., AI compute demand, product announcements, supply constraints, earnings commentary, macro semis trends).
   - Compare sentiment direction with any notable price/volume moves (where you want me to pull price data).

2) Day-by-day sentiment themes (last 7–14 days)
   - Day 1: Key drivers and sentiment tilt (bullish/bearish/neutral)
   - Day 2: Dominant topics (AI, gaming, datacenter, supply, pricing)
   - Day 3: Any product rumors or launches
   - Day 4: Competitor chatter impacting AMD
   - Day 5: Analyst commentary or major news
   - Day 6–7: Consolidation or reversal signals

3) Top sentiment themes and their implications
   - AI/Data Center demand trajectory
   - Gaming GPU cycle and crypto/non-crypto demand
   - Supply chain, wafer/fab news, yield and inventory signals
   - Product roadmap signals (RDNA/Zen generations, AI accelerators)
   - Price/valuation chatter, sentiment around guidance and margins

4) News signal synthesis (last week)
   - Press releases, earnings commentary, keynote events, partnerships, or regulatory filings
   - What the headlines imply for near-term revenue mix (Data Center vs Gaming vs Embedded)

5) Sentiment signals and trade implications
   - If sentiment shows rising enthusiasm tied to AI/Datacenter: potential upside follow-through if fundamentals support it; watch for overheating risk.
   - If sentiment is cooling on supply or competitive threats: watch for potential multiple compression or short-term downside risk.
   - Use cross-checks with price action, volatility, and volume to assess risk/entry points.

6) Risk factors to monitor
   - AI compute demand shifts, supplier constraints, competition intensity
   - Macro semis cycle and PC/GPU demand softness
   - Any unexpected product delays or governance/news events

7) Recommendations for traders
   - Short-term tactical: sentiment-driven catalysts vs. price action
   - Medium-term: timing around product launches, earnings, or supply/demand inflections
   - Risk management notes (position sizing, stop levels, correlation with broader semis ETFs)

8) Key takeaways
   - Concise verdict on momentum vs. risk
   - Where sentiment aligns or diverges from fundamentals

Deliverables you’ll receive
- A comprehensive, narrative long-form report with sections above
- A MakrMarkdown-style table at the end organizing key themes, sentiment signals, drivers, and trade implications

Sample markdown table format (to be filled with data once available)
- Theme | Latest Sentiment Tilt | Primary Driver | Potential Trade Implication | Confidence

Next steps
- If you can provide alternative data sources (e.g., a different social feed you want me to analyze, or you’d like me to pull from AMD’s newsroom, Reuters/Bloomberg headlines, or Yahoo Finance comments), I can proceed with a complete synthesis using those sources.
- Alternatively, I can stand by to retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available again.

Would you like me to:
- Proceed with the above outline and draft the full narrative now (leaving placeholders where data will be filled in later), or
- Wait and retry Reddit data retrieval, or
- Switch to an alternative data source you specify (news wires, official statements, other social channels)?
