Recommendation: Hold

Rationale at a glance
- The AMD thesis remains plausible but not yet proven at scale. Near-term catalysts (ROCm monetization, enterprise licensing, consistent data-center bookings) are not yet repeatable, and macro IT spending can remain volatile.
- Valuation remains sensitive to ambitious growth assumptions. A softer cadence on bookings or margin headwinds could compress multiples.
- There is meaningful optionality if ROCm monetization and AI software demand materialize, but that requires sustained, verifiable progress beyond pilots.

Key points supporting Hold
- Execution risk persists: ROCm monetization, enterprise licensing, and edge AI traction need to demonstrate durable revenue and margin impact, not just pilot programs.
- Demand visibility is uncertain: Data-center bookings and hyperscaler priorities can swing quarter to quarter.
- Downside protection when progress stalls: The stock is sensitive to any miss or slower-than-expected AI spend reacceleration.

Strategic actions for current AMD holders
- Hedge or cap risk around AI-cycle headlines (consider protective puts or a collar).
- Manage exposure: reduce position size toward a target weight (e.g., trim from a heavier weight toward modest exposure) until clearer catalysts emerge.
- Set reassessment triggers after upcoming catalysts (earnings, bookings cadence, ROCm licensing milestones).

Conditions to move from Hold to Buy (future catalysts)
- Repeated, verifiable data-center design wins or bookings that translate into credible revenue visibility (not just pilots).
- Meaningful ROCm monetization with enterprise licensing or royalties and a measurable gross-margin uplift tied to software-driven revenue.
- Demonstrable edge AI traction with revenue/backlog expansion and evidence of sustainable margin improvement.
- Macro IT spend stabilization or acceleration that confirms AI-driven capex momentum.

Conditions to move from Hold to Sell (risk scenarios)
- Data-center bookings deteriorate quarter-to-quarter or ROCm monetization stalls without a clear plan to restart them.
- Margin pressure materializes from mix or cost inflation, with no offsetting software-driven margin gains.
- Broader AI/tech demand weakens due to macro headwinds, leading to rate/volume disappointment.

Concrete monitoring indicators (optional numeric targets for future review)
- Data-center bookings cadence: consecutive quarters beating consensus by a meaningful margin (e.g., >5% vs. consensus for two quarters).
- ROCm monetization: enterprise licenses or royalties contributing verifiable revenue within 1â€“2 quarters of announcement.
- Gross margin: sustained improvement driven by data-center mix and software contributions (quantify when available).

Final takeaway
- Hold now, with disciplined monitoring and explicit criteria to re-enter growth as credible, repeatable evidence accumulates. Be prepared to tighten or exit if catalysts stall or macro conditions deteriorate.
