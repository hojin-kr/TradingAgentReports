I attempted to fetch AMD data and run the indicator analyses, but the data tools returned a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can retry fetching the data, or you can provide a CSV/summary if you have one. In the meantime, here is a detailed, non-data-specific analysis approach with a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) that provide complementary insights for AMD's stock context.

Selected indicators (8, non-redundant) and rationale
- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: short-term momentum via a fast exponential moving average.
  - Why suitable: Captures quick shifts in price action; helps identify potential entry points when momentum turns. Used in combination with longer trend gauges to filter noise.
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: medium-term trend direction via the 50-day simple moving average.
  - Why suitable: Serves as a dynamic support/resistance level and trend filter. Indicates whether price is in a broader uptrend or downtrend.
- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: long-term trend via the 200-day simple moving average.
  - Why suitable: Core trend benchmark; helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death cross contexts) and aligns with strategic positioning.
- macd
  - What it measures: momentum via the difference between two EMAs (MACD line).
  - Why suitable: Signals trend changes through crossovers and divergences; complements price/MA signals with momentum confirmation.
- macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD).
  - Why suitable: Crossovers between MACD and MACDS offer actionable triggers; reduces false signals when used with other filters.
- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD histogram (momentum strength).
  - Why suitable: Visualizes momentum magnitude and potential divergence early; helps gauge increasing or waning momentum alongside MACD lines.
- rsi
  - What it measures: relative strength (momentum) to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why suitable: Complements trend signals by highlighting momentum extremes; watch for divergence and failure to reach extreme levels in strong trends.
- atr
  - What it measures: volatility via true range average.
  - Why suitable: Important for risk management and position sizing; helps adjust stops and quantify market noise.

How these indicators work together (trader-friendly interpretation)
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to gauge the prevailing trend. When price remains above both, AMD is in a broader uptrend; when below both, consider downside risk. Look for crossovers or confluence (e.g., price above 50SMA and 200SMA crossing up) as alignment signals.
- Momentum timing: MACD, MACDS, and MACDH provide momentum cues. A bullish MACD crossover (MACD above MACDS) with rising MACDH suggests strengthening upside momentum; a bearish crossover or negative MACDH trend warns of potential weakness.
- Short-term entry points: close_10_ema can help identify quick shifts in momentum that may precede or accompany MACD signals. Use it to time entries after a MACD confirmation, but be mindful of noise in choppier markets.
- Momentum extremes and risk: RSI flags potential reversals when overbought/oversold; in strong uptrends RSI can stay high for extended periods, so interpret RSI in the context of the trend (prefer confirmations from MACD and price position relative to the moving averages).
- Volatility/risk management: ATR informs how much volatility AMD is showing, guiding stop placement and position sizing. Higher ATR means wider stops; lower ATR means tighter stops when appropriate.

Notes on AMD context (without current numeric readings)
- If AMD is trading above 50SMA and 200SMA with a rising MACD histogram and a positive MACD cross, the combination suggests a favorable momentum backdrop within a longer-term uptrend. In such a case, a trader might look for a pullback toward the 50SMA/10EMA as a potential entry while using ATR to set a reasonable stop.
- If price is near or below the 200SMA with a deteriorating MACD (MACD below MACDS, negative MACDH) and RSI failing to reclaim mid-range, the environment tends toward risk-off or a trend reversal, suggesting caution or a tighter risk stance.
- In volatile periods (high ATR), even with bullish MACD signals, adjust stops wider to avoid premature exits during noise. The RSI can help warn if momentum is overly extended, signaling potential short-term pullbacks.

Proposed next steps (actionable)
- If you want, I can retry fetching actual AMD data and compute these eight indicators to provide a data-driven, numeric readout.
- Alternatively, if you have a specific date range or time frame (e.g., last 6 months, last 12 months) or you can provide a CSV, I can run the analysis immediately against that data.
- If you want to expand beyond 8 indicators, I can add one more category (e.g., VWMA for volume-confirmed trends) but would drop a current indicator to keep to eight.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation guide
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AMD | Practical trading note |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum (10-period EMA) | Quick momentum shifts; use with larger trend filters | Look for confluence with MACD for entry timing; avoid chases in choppy markets |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend (50-day SMA) | Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend; below implies potential weakness | Use as dynamic support/resistance; prefer long entries when price is above 50SMA |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend (200-day SMA) | Price above 200SMA indicates long-term uptrend; below indicates long-term risk | Golden cross (50 crossing 200) is a potential bullish signal; death cross is bearish risk indicator |
| macd | Momentum via MACD line | Bullish cross (MACD above MACDS) and rising MACDH indicate upside momentum | Confirm with price above key SMAs to reduce false positives |
| macds | MACD signal line | Crosses with MACD provide trade signals; filter with other indicators | Use as trigger alongside price/MA alignment |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Increasing positive MACDH confirms strengthening momentum; negative suggests waning momentum | Watch for divergence between price action and MACDH |
| rsi | Momentum strength (overbought/oversold) | RSI above 70 indicates overbought; below 30 indicates oversold | In uptrends, RSI can stay high; look for bearish/bullish divergence for reversals |
| atr | Volatility (risk metric) | Rising ATR shows increasing volatility; falling ATR implies compression | Use for stop placement and position sizing; adjust risk to current volatility |
