# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
Hold. Near-term risks and upside are both plausible, but execution on ROCm monetization and data-center growth, plus valuation, aren’t resolved. Await tangible catalysts before re-rating.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold. Confidence: Moderate

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Execution risk on ROCm monetization, enterprise licensing, and edge AI traction; durable revenue and margin uplift have not yet proven themselves.
- Near-term demand visibility is unclear; data-center bookings and hyperscaler budgets can swing quarter to quarter.
- Competitive pressure from Nvidia and possible Nvidia-Intel collaborations add headwinds to AMD’s lead.
- Valuation risk: the stock trades as if multi-year AI growth is guaranteed; slower progress could compress multiples.
- Optional upside exists from edge AI and the ROCm software ecosystem, but requires sustained, repeatable revenue, not pilots.

## Risks To Watch
- ROCm monetization does not materialize into durable software revenue or margin gains.
- Data-center demand softness or IT spending weakness weighs on revenue growth.
- Additional competitive or partnership shifts (including Nvidia-led initiatives) erode market position.
- Margin improvement stalls or fails to offset mix effects from data-center exposure.
- Valuation could compress if catalysts lag or macro conditions worsen.
