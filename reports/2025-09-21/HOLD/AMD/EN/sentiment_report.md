Apologies—the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t fetch the AMD Reddit stock news right now. I can either retry shortly or proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis based on available context and outline the process, then fill in Reddit-specific sentiment as soon as the tool is available again.

Options:
- Option A: Retry now or soon to fetch the latest Reddit data for AMD (2025-09-21) and then deliver the full, data-backed long report with a final Markdown table.
- Option B: Proceed with a high-level, data-grounded analysis that covers social sentiment themes (excluding the Reddit feed for now) and news-driven catalysts, plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table. I’ll mark where Reddit sentiment will be inserted once the tool is back.

If you’d like, I can start with Option B and deliver a comprehensive framework now, then update with Reddit-specific sentiment as soon as the tool is functioning again.

What would you prefer? If you choose Option B, here’s what I’ll deliver:
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment landscape, key risk/reward cues, and actionable implications for traders.
- Social sentiment analysis (excluding Reddit data for now): thematic clusters (AI/Data center, gaming GPUs, supply chain, pricing, new product launches), with qualitative tone (bullish, bearish, neutral) and what each theme implies for near-term price action.
- News catalysts and company fundamentals: recent AMD news, earnings context, product roadmaps, competitive dynamics with NVIDIA, segment performance (data center vs. gaming), and any macro/semicomp considerations.
- Daily sentiment sketch: a concise day-by-day interpretation (using generic public sentiment signals if Reddit data is unavailable) to illustrate momentum patterns traders watch.
- Risks and catalysts: downside risks (execution, supply chain, competition) and upside catalysts (AI adoption, new product cycles, data center demand).
- Trading implications: likely scenarios and suggested positioning ranges (without a firm buy/sell decision until data is complete).
- Markdown table: a clean, organized summary of key points, ready to be used for quick references.

If you want me to proceed now with Option B, I’ll start drafting the full report and clearly mark where Reddit sentiment will be integrated once the tool is back online.
