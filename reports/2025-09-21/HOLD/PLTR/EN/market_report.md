I attempted to fetch PLTR data and run the requested indicators, but the data retrieval step failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the data tools environment. Specifically:
- The parallel request to obtain PLTR price data and the indicators (close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macds, macdh, rsi, boll, atr) could not be executed because the underlying CSV/data source could not be located.
- I re-tried individual calls to get_YFin_data, but they also returned the same file-not-found error.

Given that environment issue, I can’t produce live indicator values or a current trend readout for PLTR right now. If you’d like, I can:
- Retry the data fetch in a moment, or
- Proceed with a qualitative, scenario-based framework using the 8 indicators you asked for, and you can plug in the actual values once the data is available, or
- Use a cached/hypothetical data example to illustrate how the indicators would inform trading decisions.

In the meantime, here is a detailed, actionable plan with the proposed 8 indicators for PLTR, along with how to interpret them once you have the data.

Proposed indicator set (maximum 8 indicators) and rationale
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance.
  - Use: Price above 50SMA suggests bullish bias; price below implies bearish bias. Look for confluence with other signals.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm overarching market regime.
  - Use: Golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) is a bullish longer-term signal; death cross is bearish. Use for strategic context rather than entry timing alone.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - Role: Short-term momentum signal; reacts quickly to price changes.
  - Use: Price above 10EMA indicates short-term bullish momentum; price below indicates downside momentum. Use with longer-term SMAs to filter noise.
- macd (MACD)
  - Role: Momentum and trend-change signal via crossovers of MACD line with signal line.
  - Use: Bullish cross (MACD above signal) supports upside momentum; bearish cross supports downside momentum. Confirm with other filters in choppier markets.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Role: Smoothing of MACD; helps validate MACD cross signals.
  - Use: Use crossovers with MACD proper to trigger signals; helps reduce false positives in noisy markets.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Role: Momentum strength; divergence hints earlier than price moves.
  - Use: Expanding positive histogram supports strengthening bullish momentum; rising negative histogram indicates increasing downside momentum. Use with price trend for confirmation.
- rsi (RSI)
  - Role: Momentum and overbought/oversold framing.
  - Use: RSI > 70 indicates overbought risk; RSI < 30 indicates oversold risk. In strong trends, RSI can stay extended; look for bullish/bearish divergence with price and confirm with trend indicators.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - Role: Bollinger Middle (20SMA) as a volatility-adjusted baseline; helps identify breakouts and mean reversion zones.
  - Use: Price riding the upper band with expanding bands can indicate strong upside momentum; price testing or crossing lower band can indicate potential reversions or continuation depending on context. Use with ATR for volatility sizing.

How to interpret these together (conceptual framework for PLTR)
- Trend confirmation: If PLTR price trades above both 50SMA and 200SMA, with 50SMA trending above 200SMA, the macro context is bullish. A pullback toward the 50SMA or 200SMA that holds can present a buying opportunity, provided momentum indicators align.
- Momentum validation: A bullish MACD cross (MACD above signal) accompanied by a rising MACD histogram and RSI not in overbought territory strengthens the case for a sustained move. Conversely, a bearish MACD cross with a falling histogram and RSI rolling off from overbought levels adds downside conviction.
- Volatility and entry timing: Bollinger Middle alignment with current price action helps set expectations for mean reversion vs. breakout. If price breaks above the upper Bollinger band with rising ATR, it may indicate a strong breakout; a move toward the lower band with rising ATR could indicate increased volatility and potential risk.
- Risk management: ATR can be used alongside these indicators to set position sizing and stop levels, ensuring stops adapt to current volatility.

Next steps (practical)
- If you want, I can re-run the data fetch now or at a specific time, and then produce a detailed, data-driven trend report using the 8 indicators above.
- Alternatively, you can provide the actual CSV/data or allow me to work from a snapshot you paste, and I’ll compute the indicators and deliver a precise, trend-by-trend analysis with buy/hold/sell guidance.

Markdown table: Key points and interpretation framework
| Indicator | Category | Role / What it tells you | How to interpret for PLTR (once data is available) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA; cross with price or other SMAs indicates direction and potential pullbacks. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Golden cross near/below/above 200SMA; confirms/contradicts primary trend implied by price action. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts in momentum; used to time entries when aligned with longer-term trend. |
| macd | MACD | Momentum/trend-change via EMA differences | Bullish/bearish cross; corroborate with histogram and RSI for entry/exit signals. |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD line | Crosses with MACD to validate signals; reduces false positives in noisy markets. |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength; divergence cues | Expanding/contracting histogram signals strength of move; watch for divergence with price. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold and momentum strength | RSI extremes imply possible reversals; consider with trend direction and MACD. Watch for divergence. |
| boll | Volatility (Bollinger Middle) | Baseline for price relative to volatility; breakout/mean-reversion cue | Upper band breakouts suggest strong upside momentum; lower band or mean-reversion setups suggest pullbacks; use with ATR for sizing. |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now and then provide a fully data-driven report with the eight indicators, including current values, signals, and a concrete buy/hold/sell assessment for PLTR. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry data fetch now, or
- Proceed with the qualitative framework and wait for data, or
- Share data externally to compute the indicators.
