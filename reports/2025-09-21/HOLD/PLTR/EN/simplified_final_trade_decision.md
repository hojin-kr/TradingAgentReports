# Investment Report: PLTR
## Executive Summary
Palantir provides data software for governments and businesses. Near-term upside hinges on UK/EU expansion and better margins, but earnings can be choppy from government work and currency changes. Hold with a milestone-driven plan to upgrade if Europe milestones prove durable.

## Investment Decision
Investment Decision: Hold. Confidence level: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Europe/UK expansion could diversify revenue and reduce reliance on US government contracts.
- Foundry, Palantirâ€™s data platform, offers recurring software revenue and cross-sell potential across industries.
- AI trends and strong data governance help Palantir position itself as a trusted AI-infrastructure layer in regulated areas.
- Near-term monetization depends on turning pilots into actual contracts; milestones are not guaranteed and timing matters for margin gains.

## Risks To Watch
- Revenue can be lumpy due to government work; milestones may slip or not materialize as hoped.
- Cross-border rules and regulatory delays in Europe, plus location-based data rules and procurement cycles.
- Currency changes can impact margins; hedging is imperfect and multi-year deals expose the company to FX moves.
- High stock price multiple makes the stock sensitive to missed milestones or slower monetization; competition from large tech players could erode the moat.
- AI hype risk: softer macro or defense spending could shorten the path to expected monetization.
