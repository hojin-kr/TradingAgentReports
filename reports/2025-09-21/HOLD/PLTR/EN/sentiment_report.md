Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to pull the latest Reddit-based sentiment data for PLTR, but the data-fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a backend issue with the tool right now, not with the data itself. I can retry, but I don’t want to waste your time if you’d rather proceed another way. Here are your options:

What I can do next
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now and then deliver a complete, long-form PLTR sentiment + news report with a detailed Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: Proceed with a manual synthesis using other public signals (news headlines, typical sentiment drivers, and known PLTR themes) and clearly label it as not pulled from the Reddit tool. I’ll still deliver a thorough, trader-oriented analysis and a Markdown table.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, say “Retry now” for Option A or “Manual synthesis” for Option B. If you prefer, I can also try a quick retry first and then decide how to proceed based on whether the tool returns data.

Preview of what I’ll deliver (regardless of path)
- Executive snapshot: brief view of current sentiment signals, notable news catalysts in the past week, and implied risk/uncertainty.
- Social sentiment analysis: day-by-day feel (bullish/neutral/bearish) with key driver themes (e.g., AI capabilities, Foundry adoption, government deals, valuation concerns).
- News analysis: 1–2 bullet themes per major headline, potential impact on price and perception, and any regulatory or competitive context.
- Trader-focused implications: how sentiment and news translate into potential short-term (days to weeks) moves, including scenarios (bullish, neutral, bearish) and probable catalysts.
- Risk considerations: notable outsized risks (execution, customer mix, government exposure, competition, macro factors).
- Takeaways and actionable ideas: how to position around PLTR given the current sentiment and news posture.
- Makrdown table at the end to organize key points (see the sample table structure below).

Provisional structure for the Markdown table (to be filled with live data)
- The table will include columns like:
  - Date
  - Source (Reddit / News / Other)
  - Sentiment (Bullish / Bearish / Neutral)
  - Top Theme / Catalyst
  - Notable Headline or Quote
  - Potential Price Implication (short-term)
  - Confidence Level
  - Trader Action (Watch / Long/Short / None)
  - Notes

If you want me to proceed now, just say which option you prefer. If you’d rather wait for the tool to come back online, I can queue up the full report as soon as the data fetch succeeds.
