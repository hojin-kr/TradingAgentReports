I attempted to pull the latest PLTR insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the quarterly SimFin financial statements, but the tool backend returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like an environment/data access issue rather than an issue with your request. I can retry the data pulls, or proceed with a qualitative fundamentals-oriented analysis in the meantime.

Options to proceed
- Retry data pull now: I can reattempt fetching
  - Finnhub insider sentiment for PLTR (past 15 days from 2025-09-21)
  - Finnhub insider transactions for PLTR (past 15 days from 2025-09-21)
  - SimFin balance sheet (quarterly) as of 2025-09-21
  - SimFin income statement (quarterly) as of 2025-09-21
  - SimFin cash flow (quarterly) as of 2025-09-21
- Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals report: I’ll provide a detailed, trader-focused analysis based on Palantir’s business model, cadence of revenue generation, typical margin profile, capital allocation tendencies, and general insider sentiment/transactions patterns as context, clearly labeled as not containing the latest data.

If you’d like me to retry, say “Retry now.” If you’d prefer a qualitative overview now, I’ll proceed with that and note where data gaps exist due to the current tool issue.

Proposed structure for the report (whether we fetch data or not)
- Company profile and business model
- Revenue model and segmentation (government/healthcare/industrial, commercial BI, etc.)
- Recent financial history (overall revenue growth, gross margins, operating leverage, cash burn/runway)
- Balance sheet highlights (liquidity, debt, working capital)
- Cash flow perspective (operating cash flow, free cash flow trajectory)
- Insider sentiment (qualitative read on management/investor tone, if available)
- Insider transactions (significant buys/sells, if available)
- Key risk factors (customer concentration, contract visibility, government policy exposure, competitive dynamics)
- Trading implications and scenarios (bullish/bearish catalysts, risk controls, what to watch next)
- Appendices
  - A: Quick-reference facts
  - B: Markdown table of key takeaways

Proposed Markdown table to append at the end (you can fill in once data is retrieved)
- Ticker: PLTR
- Date of analysis: 2025-09-21
- Source data status: (data fetch status)
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days): (summary)
- Insider transactions (past 15 days): (summary)
- Balance sheet (latest quarterly): (key items, liquidity)
- Income statement (latest quarterly): (revenue, gross margin, op income)
- Cash flow (latest quarterly): (operating cash flow, free cash flow)
- Revenue mix notes: (Gov vs Commercial, contract visibility)
- Profitability trend: (gross margin trend, operating margin trend)
- Cash runway / liquidity: (cash, equivalents, runway indicators)
- Key risks: (bullets)
- Trading take / signal hypothesis: (bull case / bear case)

Would you like me to retry the data pulls now, or would you prefer I start with the qualitative fundamentals overview and clearly label any data gaps due to the current tool error?
