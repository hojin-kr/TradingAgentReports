Recommendation: HOLD Palantir (PLTR)

Rationale
- Core thesis remains intact: Foundry’s cross-industry applicability and AI-infrastructure positioning, plus Europe-facing growth (UK and EU pilots) could improve revenue visibility and diversify away from US government exposure.
- Near-term risks are tangible: revenue recognition can stay lumpy due to government programs, cross-border regulatory and procurement hurdles, currency/FX effects, and a still-elevated multiple that can contract if milestones slip or margins don’t expand as expected.
- Valuation remains sensitive to monetization tempo. While milestones could unlock durable upside, they’re not guaranteed on a tight timeline, and execution risk in Europe can dampen near-term multiple expansion.
- Strategy aligns with risk discipline: maintain exposure without overweighting on an AI-hype re-rating, and rely on verifiable milestones and margin signals before adjusting position size.

What to do next (two options)
- Option A (preferred for rigor): Build a milestone-driven model with explicit UK/EU scenario paths, translating the narrative into numbers (backlog, revenue recognition cadence, gross margins, operating cash flow) to quantify upside/downside under base/bull/bear outcomes.
- Option B: Run a data-driven update using live indicators (price action around key moving averages, MACD, RSI, volatility, earnings/backlog disclosures, FX hedging status) to support a near-term timing decision and scorecard.

My pick
- Proceed with Option A to convert these milestones into a quantitative framework. This will give you a concrete risk-adjusted view of potential outcomes and clearer triggers for future action (upgrade to Buy if milestones materialize with margin expansion; trim/hedge if milestones slip or margins stagnate).

If you’d like, I can start by outlining a simple three-scenario model (base/bull/bear) with plausible UK/EU revenue and backlog inputs, and define explicit thresholds for upgrading toward Buy or trimming exposure. I can also prepare a lightweight live-readout plan later if you prefer Option B as a follow-on.

Would you like me to:
- Build a milestone-driven model with explicit UK/EU numbers, or
- Run a live-indicator, scorecard-based update for near-term timing?

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
