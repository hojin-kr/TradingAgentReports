Heads up: data retrieval issue encountered.

- I attempted to fetch NFLX fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly SimFin balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) for 2025-09-21, but I got FileNotFoundError from the data access layer for all requested tools.
- This means I can’t currently provide the full, data-backed fundamental report with insider signals and the latest quarterly statements.

What I can do next:
- Retry the data fetch now or at a specified time. If you’d like, I can attempt again immediately and report back.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with a partial report focusing on publicly available fundamentals or a framework and methodology you can use once data is accessible.

What I will deliver once data is accessible (comprehensive NFLX fundamental report):
- Company profile: business model, segments, key market position, notable shifts (e.g., content strategy, pricing, subscriber trends).
- Financial statements (recent quarterly and year-to-date):
  - Income statement: revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, margins, and year-over-year/quarter-over-quarter trends.
  - Balance sheet: assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity metrics (current ratio, quick ratio), and leverage components (debt/equity, interest coverage).
  - Cash flow: operating, investing, and financing cash flows; free cash flow where applicable; cash conversion cycle insights.
- Financial history and trajectory:
  - Revenue growth rates, profitability trends, margin expansion/compression, capital expenditure cadence, and any one-time items.
  - Capital structure evolution, debt maturities, and liquidity runway.
- Insider signals:
  - Insider sentiment (net sentiment signals from the past 15 days) and interpretation.
  - Insider transactions (net buying/selling activity in the past 15 days), notable insiders, and potential implications for confidence and risk.
- Fine-grained insights for traders:
  - What the numbers imply about earnings quality, cash generation, and sustainability.
  - Potential catalysts or red flags (e.g., dilutive financing, aggressive content spend, peak subscriber churn risks, operating leverage opportunities).
  - Scenario analysis (base/bull/bear) anchored to the latest data.
- Risk factors and caveats:
  - Data limitations, reliance on quarterly cadence, and potential revisions.
- Appendix: Definitions of metrics used and a glossary.

Markdown table (to be appended at the end of the final report):
- The table will summarize key points such as:
  - Metric or theme
  - Latest value (with date)
  - QoQ/YoY change
  - Interpretation and trader takeaway
  - Data source (e.g., SimFin balance sheet, SimFin income statement, insider data)

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
1) Retry data retrieval now (I’ll re-run the data calls as soon as possible and provide a full report).
2) Proceed with a partial report focusing on high-level publicly known fundamentals (no insider data) while we resolve the tool issue.
3) Wait and I’ll confirm when the data access error is resolved and then deliver the full report.
