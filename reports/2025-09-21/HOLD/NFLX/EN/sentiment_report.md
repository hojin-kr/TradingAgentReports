Thanks for the reset. I attempted to fetch NFLX Reddit stock news for 2025-09-21, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (it’s a tool-side issue right now). I’ve retried once, and it failed again. 

How would you like to proceed?
- Retry now and keep trying to pull the Reddit/news data for NFLX on 2025-09-21 (and possibly nearby dates) until it succeeds.
- Switch to an alternative data source/method (if you have other sources enabled) to continue the sentiment and news analysis for the past week.
- Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using available public signals (without the Reddit tool) and clearly flag that Reddit-specific data is unavailable for the moment.

If you want me to keep trying with the Reddit tool, I’ll keep attempting and begin aggregating once it returns results. In parallel, I can outline exactly what the final report will include so you know what to expect:

Planned contents for the NFLX report (once data is available)
- Day-by-day sentiment snapshot (positive/neutral/negative) from Reddit and other social channels over the past 7 days.
- Top recurring themes and catalysts (e.g., content slate, pricing/news on ads-supported tiers, subscriber growth/metering, international expansion, regulatory or macro factors).
- Sidelined risks and tail risks mentioned by the community (e.g., execution risk on new pricing, competition, content costs).
- Latest company news alignment with sentiment (earnings, subscriber metrics, guidance, new launches, partnerships).
- Implications for traders:
  - Potential catalysts or risk events in the near term.
  - Sentiment-driven momentum vs. fundamentals-driven moves.
  - Break-even or threshold levels where sentiment shifts may precede price moves.
- A concise, reader-friendly Markdown table at the end (key themes, sentiment level, notable quotes, potential catalysts, risks).

If you confirm, I’ll retry the data pull and then deliver the full, detailed report with the requested Markdown table.
