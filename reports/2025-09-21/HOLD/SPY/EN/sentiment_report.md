Sorry — the Reddit data tool didn’t return correctly and threw a FileNotFoundError when I tried to fetch SPY-related Reddit news for 2025-09-21. I can retry if you’d like, but I can also proceed with a robust framework and fill in the actual Reddit-derived insights as soon as the tool is working again.

How would you like to proceed?
- Retry now to pull the Reddit data for SPY, 2025-09-21
- Or proceed with a comprehensive SPY sentiment and news framework using available sources I can access, and I’ll fill in Reddit details as soon as the tool is functional

In the meantime, here’s a thorough framework and a ready-to-fill report outline for SPY, focused on social media sentiment (past week), public news, and implications for traders. I’ve included a Markdown table at the end to organize key points. Once the Reddit data flows in, I’ll populate the analysis with concrete metrics and topics.

What this report will cover (structure)
- Executive snapshot
  - What traders should watch this week: macro drivers, major levels, and sentiment drift indicators.
- Social media sentiment overview (past 7 days)
  - Overall tone (positive/negative/neutral) with day-by-day drift
  - Dominant themes and topics (e.g., macro news, Fed commentary, inflation, tech/economic data)
  - Key influencer voices or communities (e.g., notable subreddits or threads if available)
- Reddit-derived sentiment highlights (pending data)
  - Top bullish vs. bearish threads
  - Momentum: days with sharp sentiment flips
  - Sentiment drivers (e.g., rate expectations, earnings, geopolitical context)
- News and events (past 7 days)
  - Public company news, macro news, policy developments, economic data releases
  - How news items typically impact SPY (issues like inflation data, Fed rhetoric, geopolitical risk)
- Market context and sentiment synthesis
  - How social sentiment aligns or diverges from price action, volume, and options activity
  - Potential scenarios for SPY: bullish continuation, consolidation, or downside risk, with trigger events
- Trading implications and risk considerations
  - Short-term strategies (intraday to several days) vs. longer-term view
  - Key risk factors to monitor (risk-on/risk-off shifts, liquidity, macro surprises)
- Data gaps and next steps
  - What to expect once Reddit data returns
  - Additional data sources to triangulate sentiment

Key methodology notes
- Sentiment scoring approach: combine automated sentiment signals from social posts with manual thematic tagging to identify recurring topics (e.g., inflation, rate path, earnings, geopolitical risk).
- Temporal granularity: daily sentiment deltas over the past 7 days, plus a rolling 7-day view to capture trend shifts.
- Topic extraction: identify most-mentioned topics and their sentiment association (positive/negative/neutral).
- Correlation checks: compare sentiment shifts with SPY price action, intraday volume, and notable option activity where available.

Planned deliverables (formats)
- Narrative analysis with bullet-point highlights per day
- Thematic breakdowns (top 5 themes by day and cumulatively)
- Quantified sentiment metrics (where data is available)
- Trading implications with concrete scenarios and proposed moves

Sample Markdown table (key points format)
| Topic / Metric | Source / Data Type | Latest Read (7d) | Trend (7d) | Implications for SPY | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Overall social sentiment | Social posts (Reddit + others) | TBD | TBD | Potential drag or lift to near-term price depending on sentiment drift | TBD |
| Top bullish themes | Topic analysis | TBD | TBD | If bullish themes align with price action, may support upside moves; if discordant, watch for reversals | TBD |
| Top bearish themes | Topic analysis | TBD | TBD | Bearish drivers could precede pullbacks; monitor for risk-off signals | TBD |
| Macro/news catalysts | News feed | TBD | TBD | Key catalysts (Fed comments, inflation data, economic surprises) could pivot SPY direction | TBD |

| Key technical levels to watch | Price action / volume | TBD | TBD | Breakouts or breakdowns around major levels could trigger faster moves | TBD |

Next steps
- If you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, say “Retry.”
- If you’d prefer I proceed with the framework and begin drafting the report using other sources or generic context, say “Proceed with framework.” I will clearly label sections that are pending Reddit data and indicate data confidence.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit pull now, or proceed with the framework and start drafting with placeholders for Reddit insights?
