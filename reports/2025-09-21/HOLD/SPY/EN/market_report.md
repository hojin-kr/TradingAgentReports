I attempted to fetch SPY data for 2023-09-21 to 2025-09-21 but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a backend/data-path issue rather than a market issue. I can retry the fetch now, or switch to an alternative data source if you permit. In the meantime, here is a focused indicator setup tailored for SPY and a detailed framework for how I’ll interpret signals once data is available.

8 indicators selected (diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  - Why SPY: Helps gauge the prevailing market rhythm of broad equities; useful for filtering signals in range-bound periods and confirming trend direction
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  - What it measures: Long-term trend baseline
  - Why SPY: Core confirmation of bull/bear regime; golden/death cross implications; provides strategic tilt
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum with quicker reaction to price changes
  - Why SPY: Captures swift shifts in breadth/sector leadership; can help timely entries when used with longer-term trends
- macd: MACD line
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences between short and long EMA paths
  - Why SPY: Detects trend changes and momentum shifts; useful in conjunction with price trend
- macds: MACD Signal
  - What it measures: Smoothed MACD line signal
  - Why SPY: Crossovers with MACD line often indicate tradeable momentum changes; helps reduce false positives
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  - What it measures: Momentum strength and divergence (distance between MACD and its signal)
  - Why SPY: Visualizes acceleration/deceleration of momentum; divergence cues can precede price moves
- rsi: RSI
  - What it measures: Relative momentum and overbought/oversold conditions
  - Why SPY: Identifies potential reversals after trend-driven momentum extremes; should be cross-checked with trend context
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA)
  - What it measures: Dynamic price benchmark and volatility context
  - Why SPY: Helps spot breakouts, pullbacks, and mean-reversion tendencies around a central baseline; works well with band edges for entries/exits

How I’ll interpret signals once data is available
- Trend confirmation with MA:
  - Price above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA generally indicates bullish regime; price below both indicates bearish regime. Look for crossovers (e.g., price crossing above/below MA or a golden/death cross) as longer-horizon signals.
- Momentum with MACD family:
  - MACD crossing above its signal (macd > macds) with rising macdh supports bullish momentum; a cross below with negative macdh supports bearish momentum. Divergence (price making new highs/lows while MACD histogram fails to) can precede reversals.
- Short-term momentum with 10 EMA:
  - Price trading above the 10_ema suggests short-term bullish tilt; crossovers with price or with longer MAs add timing nuance but may introduce noise in choppy markets; use with MACD and RSI.
- RSI usage:
  - RSI rising through 50 towards 70+ supports upside momentum; RSI failing or turning down from overbought (>70) or failing to reach 50 in an uptrend can signal weakening momentum; prefer trend confirmation from MA and MACD.
- Volatility/mean-reversion with Bollinger middle:
  - Price testing or riding the boll line can indicate consolidation or breakout phases. Breakouts beyond the upper band with supportive MACD/rsi can indicate stronger moves; conversely, moving toward lower band in the presence of bearish MACD can reinforce downside bias.
- Integrated picture:
  - Look for confluences: e.g., price above 50_SMA and 200_SMA, MACD positive with rising macdh, RSI above 50 but not overbought, and price moving toward/through the Boll middle with a breakout beyond the upper Boll band. This combination strengthens a directional bias.
  - For reversals: weakness in MACD/macdh with RSI failing to hold above midline (50) and price testing the middle Boll line after touching an extreme can precede a pullback. Always weigh with the broader market context (macro, rate expectations, earnings season).

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now. If you’d like, I can also switch to an alternate data source or retry with a narrower date window to verify the data pipeline.
- Once data is retrieved, I’ll produce:
  - A detailed trend report for SPY using the 8 indicators above
  - Specific signal readings (e.g., current status of each indicator, crossovers, and momentum strength)
  - A practical trading framework with entry/exit ideas aligned with the indicators
- If you prefer, I can also switch to a different set of indicators (e.g., include VWMA or ATR) as an alternative 8-indicator lineup.

MarkDown table: Key indicators, purpose, and interpretation
| Indicator | Category | What it measures / signal type | How it helps with SPY interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Confirms trend direction and helps filter entries/reentries in SPY’s broad-market environment |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend baseline | Provides strategic trend confirmation; identifies potential regime shifts (golden/death cross implications) |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Detects quick momentum shifts; complements longer MA signals for timing |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum/trend-change signal via EMA differences | Signals potential trend changes when crossing and with the MACD histogram context |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line for crossovers | Reduces false positives; confirms MACD-driven entries/exits |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength / divergence visualization | Early warning of momentum buildup or fading; divergence insights |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Relative momentum; overbought/oversold conditions | Flags potential reversals and helps assess momentum in conjunction with trend signals |
| boll | Volatility/Mean-reversion | Bollinger middle line as dynamic benchmark | Context for breakout vs. mean-reversion; bands help validate breakout strength or pullbacks |

If you want me to proceed now, I can retry the data fetch immediately and then generate a full, data-backed trend report using these indicators. Please tell me whether to retry with the same date range, switch to a different data source, or adjust the indicator set.
