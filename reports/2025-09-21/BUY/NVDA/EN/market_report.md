Apologies — I hit a data retrieval error trying to fetch NVDA data from Yahoo Finance and to compute the indicators. The environment returned FileNotFoundError for the data fetch and for the indicator reports. I can’t produce the date-specific trend report right now. I can proceed in two ways:
- Retry data retrieval now (I’ll re-run get_YFin_data and the indicator calls as soon as the data source is accessible)
- Or proceed with a detailed, structured framework using placeholders and a best-practices interpretation plan until the data is available

If you’d like, I can retry immediately. In the meantime, here’s a careful, high-signal indicator setup I would use for NVDA and why, followed by a plan for what I’ll deliver once the data is accessible, plus a concise reference table.

Most relevant indicators I would use (up to 8, non-redundant, complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  Rationale: Ultra-common trend filter for medium-term direction and dynamic support/resistance. For NVDA, it helps distinguish sustained uptrends from bear rallies and can show whenever price tests a key dynamic floor.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark; potential golden/death cross context. Useful for strategic bias (long-only tilt in uptrends, caution in breakdowns). Helpful for NVDA’s secular growth narrative with market phases.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  Rationale: Responsive momentum proxy; captures quick shifts in price action and early entry/exit cues. In NVDA, it can highlight fast developing moves around earnings or product-cycle catalysts.
- macd: MACD line
  Rationale: Core momentum gauge; crossovers of MACD with zero or with signal line indicate momentum shifts. For NVDA, useful to confirm breakout/momentum bursts or trend fatigue.
- macds: MACD Signal
  Rationale: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD help reduce false signals. Complements macd for timing decisions.
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  Rationale: Visualizes momentum magnitude and divergence dynamics; helps spot waning or strengthening momentum ahead of MACD crossovers.
- rsi: RSI
  Rationale: Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and divergence signals. NVDA often experiences sharp moves; RSI helps identify potential pullbacks or reversals when used with trend filters.
- atr: Average True Range
  Rationale: Volatility gauge for sizing and risk management. NVDA can have episodic spikes in volatility around earnings, product launches, or supply-chain news; ATR helps adjust stops and position sizing accordingly.

Plan for delivering a very detailed, date-specific trend report (once data is accessible)
- Step 1: Retrieve NVDA price history for the requested window and compute all eight indicators from the exact same data slice.
- Step 2: Synthesize signals into a confluence score (trend direction from SMAs/EMA, momentum from MACD trio and RSI, volatility from ATR).
- Step 3: Identify key narrative regimes:
  - Trend alignment vs. misalignment (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA with positive MACD and RSI in bullish territory).
  - Momentum strength/weakness (MACD histogram height, MACD crossovers, RSI divergence).
  - Volatility regime (ATR levels, any spike events).
- Step 4: Provide actionable readings:
  - Confirmed uptrend with pullback test near 50 or 200 SMA plus positive MACD cross and RSI holding above 50 may indicate continuation buys.
  - Breakouts above recent highs with rising ATR and MACD strength could support breakout trades.
  - Deterioration signals (price crossing below 50 SMA, MACD bearish cross, RSI failing at overbought, rising ATR) would flag caution or risk controls.
- Step 5: Build a concise risk-aware plan:
  - Proposed stop-loss placement guided by ATR
  - Dynamic targets using nearby support/resistance levels around SMA lines
  - Evaluation of earnings/major news catalysts and how they could impact NVDA’s regime shifts
- Step 6: Deliver a structured summary with a Markdown table (see below) and a detailed narrative explaining the scenarios and recommended actions.

Why this combination fits NVDA context
- NVDA tends to move with strong momentum and substantial volatility, especially around earnings and sector catalysts. The selected indicators balance trend confirmation (50/200 SMAs), dynamic entry points (10 EMA), momentum confirmation (MACD trio and RSI), and risk management (ATR). This mix helps identify sustained moves, reduce false signals in whippy markets, and adjust risk in high-volatility periods.

If you’d like me to proceed now, I will retry data retrieval and then generate the full, date-specific, nuanced NVDA trend report with the eight indicators and a final Markdown table. Otherwise, I can provide the same framework once the data source is accessible.
