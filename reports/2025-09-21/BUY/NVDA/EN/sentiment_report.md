I’m sorry — the Reddit data tool isn’t responding right now. I attempted to fetch NVDA Reddit sentiment for 2025-09-21 several times, but I’m getting a FileNotFoundError from the tool. I can’t pull the Reddit data at the moment, so I can’t produce the full week-long analysis with sentiment trends from that source just yet.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can keep retrying the Reddit data fetch for NVDA and then generate the full report as soon as it succeeds.
- Switch sources: If you have access to another data source (e.g., public news feeds, other social platforms, or a CSV/URL with sentiment data), share it and I’ll analyze that immediately.
- Proceed with a framework: I can draft the complete long-form analysis structure, including the methodology, what to look for in sentiment and news, and the final Markdown table skeleton. Once the Reddit tool (or alternative data) is available, I’ll fill in the specifics.

If you’d like me to proceed with the framework now, here is the plan I’ll follow and the final deliverable I’ll produce once data is available:
- Objective: Assess NVDA’s current state via social media sentiment (focusing on Reddit but including other sources if available), recent company news, and implications for traders.
- Time window: Past 7 days, with day-by-day sentiment breakdown if data allows.
- Data sources (planned): Reddit posts and comments by day, notable NVDA news articles and press releases, any publicly available sentiment summaries.
- Analysis components:
  - Sentiment overview: overall tone (bullish/bearish/neutral), any spikes in volume or negativity/positivity, by day.
  - Top themes: AI demand, supply chain, product launches/updates, earnings expectations, regulatory/geo risks, market competition.
  - Post-level nuggets: representative quotes or paraphrases illustrating key sentiment drivers, without fabricating content.
  - News events: summarize any notable NVDA news in the past week and its potential impact.
  - Implications for traders: short-term and longer-term considerations, potential catalysts, risk factors.
  - Sentiment-health indicators: volatility of sentiment, divergence vs. price action (if price data is considered), and potential overreactions.
- Deliverable: A comprehensive long-form report with a final Markdown table at the end organizing key points.

If you’re ready, tell me which option you prefer (retry, switch sources, or proceed with the framework), and I’ll move forward accordingly.
