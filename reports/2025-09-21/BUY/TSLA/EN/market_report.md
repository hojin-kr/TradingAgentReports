I attempted to fetch TSLA data from Yahoo Finance via get_YFin_data, but I’m currently running into an internal file-not-found error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

Because of this data retrieval issue, I don’t have the price history needed to generate the indicator readings right now. I can try again automatically, or you can tell me to retry later, or switch to a different date range or ticker.

In parallel, here’s a plan for TSLA analysis once data is accessible. I’ll use 8 complementary indicators (non-redundant) to give a well-rounded view of trend, momentum, volatility, and volume.

Proposed TSLA indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the intermediate trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for spotting ongoing trend direction and potential pullbacks to a known dynamic level.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm broader market regime and detect major trend changes (golden/death cross contexts).
- close_10_ema: 10-period exponential moving average. Provides a more responsive read on short-term momentum and potential entry/exit points. Helps catch quicker shifts when combined with the longer-term averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum indicator showing the difference between two EMAs; useful for identifying trend changes and crossovers.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoother line used to generate MACD cross signals; helps reduce false positives when paired with macd.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold signals and potential divergences; good for spotting reversals when aligned with trend context.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA). Baseline for volatility bands; provides a dynamic reference for normal price movement and potential breakout/reversal zones when used with the bands.
- vwma: VWMA. Volume-weighted moving average to confirm price action with volume; adds a layer of conviction to trend moves and helps filter out volume-driven noise.

Why these are suitable for TSLA now
- TSLA tends to exhibit pronounced momentum and volatility. The 50/200 SMA pair gives a solid trend framework (intermediate vs. long-term) while the 10 EMA adds sensitivity for timely entries/exits.
- MACD and its signal line help identify shifts in momentum, which is key for a stock with frequent volatility bursts.
- RSI provides a straightforward momentum check, which is valuable for spotting overbought/oversold extremes that often coincide with sharp pullbacks or breakouts.
- Bollinger Middle acts as a dynamic price baseline; combined with VWMA, you get a sense of price-action strength relative to volume, which is useful for TSLA’s often heavy-volume days.

Next steps
- I’ll re-run get_YFin_data for TSLA as soon as the data source is available, then fetch the 8 indicators listed above via get_stockstats_indicators_report (curr_date = 2025-09-21, look_back_days = 30) in parallel.
- Once I have the indicator outputs, I’ll deliver a detailed, nuanced report with:
  - Current trend assessment (short, medium, long-term) and potential regime shifts
  - Momentum analysis (MACD lines, RSI levels/divergence)
  - Volatility context (Bollinger baseline and implied volatility cues)
  - Volume-confirmed moves (VWMA insights)
  - Potential trading cues and risk considerations (recommended notes on entries/exits and stop placement)

If you’d like me to proceed with retrying the data fetch now, say “Retry TSLA data,” and I’ll attempt again immediately. Alternatively, I can proceed with a placeholder analysis based on typical TSLA behavior and provide an interpretive framework, and then fill in the exact numbers once data loads.
