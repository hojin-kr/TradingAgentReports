I’m running into a data-access error pulling TSLA fundamentals right now. The tools returned a FileNotFoundError for insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement. I can’t fetch the latest data at the moment.

What I can do next
- Retry fetching the data now or after a short interval (often a transient issue).
- If you have any data extracts (CSV/JSON) you want me to analyze, I can work from those immediately.
- Proceed with a detailed report template using placeholders until the data are available, so you can review the structure and know exactly what will be included.

What the final report will include (once data are accessible)
- Company profile and business overview
- Most recent quarterly/annual financial statements:
  - Income statement: revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, margins
  - Balance sheet: assets, liabilities, shareholder equity, liquidity metrics
  - Cash flow: operating, investing, financing cash flows, free cash flow
- Historical financial history (QoQ and YoY where applicable):
  - Revenue growth, earnings trend, margin evolution, capex intensity
  - Balance sheet growth/decline in liquidity and leverage
  - Cash conversion cycle and cash flow quality
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Net sentiment score, notable shifts, narrative context
- Insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Purchase/sale counts, volumes, notable insiders, potential implications
- Key financial ratios and insights
  - Liquidity: current ratio, quick ratio
  - Leverage: debt/EBITDA, net debt
  - Profitability: gross/net margins, ROE/ROA
  - Cash flow quality: operating cash flow vs net income, capex intensity
- Risk and sentiment context
  - Potential catalysts and headwinds
  - How insiders are positioning and what it may imply for price reaction
- Trader-focused takeaways and scenarios
  - If revenue/margin momentum persists vs if there are cracks
  - Potential surprise risks and optionality
- Appendices
  - Data sources and timestamps
  - Methodology notes
  - Any caveats about data limitations

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry fetching the data now or after a short delay?
- If you prefer, I can run the report using a structured template and fill in the data as soon as the tools return results.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed. If you want me to retry immediately, I’ll initiate another data pull for TSLA and begin compiling the full report as soon as I have the data.
