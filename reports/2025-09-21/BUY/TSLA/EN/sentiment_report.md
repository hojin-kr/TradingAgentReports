Thanks for the prompt. I tried to pull the latest Reddit/stock info for TSLA on 2025-09-21, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data pull now, switch to an alternative data source (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, StockTwits, or a general news digest), or proceed with a structured analysis framework using placeholders until I can fetch the actual data. Here’s how I’ll proceed and what I’ll deliver once the data comes through.

What I can do right now
- Retry the Reddit stock info pull for TSLA on 2025-09-21.
- If the retry fails again, switch to an alternative sentiment/data source (recommended) and build a comprehensive sentiment/news report from that source.
- Deliver a detailed, trader-focused report with:
  - Daily sentiment breakdown for the past 7 days
  - Top themes and narratives driving sentiment
  - Correlation of sentiment with price/volume moves
  - Summary of the most impactful recent Tesla company news
  - Implications for traders (short-term moves, volatility, catalysts, risk)
  - Actionable takeaways and caveats
  - A neatly organized Markdown table at the end

Proposed structure of the final long report (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot (TL;DR)
  - Overall sentiment trend over the past week
  - Key headlines that moved sentiment
  - Any notable divergences between sentiment and price action
- Daily sentiment analysis (Past 7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment score (e.g., net bullish vs bearish)
  - Primary drivers for each day
  - Notable spikes or drops in engagement
- Thematic breakdown (top 5 themes)
  - Autonomy/FSD updates and roadmaps
  - EV demand, production/supply chain, factory updates
  - Financials and guidance
  - Competition and market positioning
  - Energy/storage and vehicle economics
- News digest (past week)
  - Summary of company announcements, regulatory updates, partnerships, earnings clues
  - Market interpretation and potential forward impact
- Price-action context
  - TSLA price, volume, and intraday volatility over the week
  - Any reported correlations between sentiment shifts and price moves
- Trader implications and risk assessment
  - Short-term catalysts to watch (earnings cadence, press events, policy changes)
  - Potential false signals and risk management notes
  - Suggested positioning logic (if applicable)
- Key takeaways and caveats
  - Strengths and weaknesses of the sentiment signal
  - Data limitations and potential biases
- Makrdown table (end of report) to summarize key points

Interim, non-data-driven insights you can expect (to give you value even if data pull is delayed)
- Expect sentiment to be sensitive to:
  - Autonomy/FSD progress updates and regulatory milestones
  - Battery technology breakthroughs and energy storage developments
  - Shanghai/Gigafactory production updates and China-market dynamics
  - Macro factors affecting EV demand (economic indicators, subsidies, interest rates)
- Potential signals traders watch:
  - A rising positive sentiment with stable/accelerating price could indicate a near-term bullish setup
  - Deteriorating sentiment on a day with strong price action might signal a possible pullback
  - High engagement spikes on negative headlines often precede higher intraday volatility

What I need from you
- Do you want me to:
  1) Retry the Reddit stock info pull for TSLA on 2025-09-21 right now, or
  2) Switch to an alternative data source (recommended) and proceed with a full sentiment/news report?

If you’d like me to proceed with option 2, I’ll pull from alternative sources (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, StockTwits, and current financial/news feeds) and deliver the complete, trader-focused report with the final Markdown table appended.

Let me know your preference, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
