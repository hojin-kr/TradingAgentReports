Assessment recap
- The provided plan emphasizes META’s upside from AI licensing, data-enabled monetization, and the AR ecosystem, while recognizing ad-cycle sensitivity, regulatory headwinds, and potential execution risk. A staged entry with risk controls aligns well with the optionality thesis.

Recommendation
- Buy, but with a staged entry and tight risk controls. Start with a partial core position now and add on clear progress or favorable price/volatility conditions. This preserves exposure to multi-year optionality while moderating near-term volatility.

Concrete execution plan
- Initial stance: initiate with a partial long exposure now (roughly 25–50% of your intended full position).
- Incremental buying triggers:
  - Confirmed licensing news with tangible terms (margin uplift, ramp timelines, and customer commitments).
  - Observable AR/AI monetization progress (software/services revenue, developer ecosystem activity, or AR software monetization milestones).
  - Technical pullbacks or favorable price action (e.g., a defined 5–10% retracement from recent highs, or a bullish catalyst on momentum indicators such as MACD or RSI moving back into bullish territory).
- Risk management:
  - Use an ATR-based stop to protect downside; position size should respect your overall portfolio risk limits and avoid over-concentration in one mega-cap name.
  - Consider hedging the core position with near-term puts or a collar if you’re concerned about sharp downside moves around catalysts.
- Monitoring cadence:
  - Track licensing terms and ramp timelines, AR product cadence and user engagement metrics, and ad-demand/regulatory developments.
  - Review quarterly guidance and earnings with a focus on licensing and AR monetization milestones.
- Time horizon: 12–24 months to assess the full impact of licensing and AR monetization against a recovering ad market.

Notes
- The thesis remains sensitive to macro ad demand and regulatory dynamics. If licensing progress stalls or ad-market headwinds intensify, be prepared to adjust exposure or consider selling partial portions to protect capital.
- A fully quantitative layer can be added later when data access resumes (e.g., price action relative to moving averages, momentum, and volatility metrics) to refine entry/exit rails.

Final decision
- Buy with staged exposure and risk controls.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
