Thanks. I attempted to fetch META’s quarterly financials and insider data, but the data retrieval tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError (i.e., the data source isn't accessible right now). Here’s what happened and how we can proceed:

What happened
- Attempted parallel data pull for META (quarterly freq) on 2025-09-21:
  - Simfin balance sheet
  - Simfin income statement
  - Simfin cash flow
  - Finnhub insider sentiment
  - Finnhub insider transactions
- All calls returned FileNotFoundError. This means the current environment couldn’t access the data sources, so I don’t yet have the numbers to include in a fully data-backed fundamental report.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval now (in case the issue is ephemeral).
- If retries fail, switch to alternative sources or proceed with a qualitative, heavily caveated analysis based on recent public information (without numbers) and clearly mark data gaps.
- Once data can be retrieved, I’ll produce a comprehensive, trader-focused fundamental report with granular detail (financials, history, insider signals, and a final summary table).

Proposed structure of the final report (once data is available)
- Company profile
  - Business model and segments (e.g., Family of Apps, Advertising, AI initiatives, any hardware/Reality Labs exposure)
  - Geographic and product mix
  - Competitive landscape and strategic positioning (AI, short-form video, metaverse bets, regulatory considerations)
- Basic financials (latest quarter and year-over-year context)
  - Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EBITDA, margins
  - Earnings per share, return metrics (ROA, ROE), and any non-GAAP adjustments
  - Key efficiency metrics (gross margin stability, opex as a % of revenue, R&D intensity)
- Balance sheet snapshot
  - Cash & equivalents, short/long-term investments, debt levels, net cash position
  - Working capital dynamics, liquidity ratios, capital structure
- Cash flow analysis
  - Operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow
  - Cash conversion cycle and any seasonal patterns
- Financial history and trend analysis
  - Revenue and profitability trends over the past several quarters/years
  - Cost structure evolution (R&D vs SG&A), scale effects, margin compression/expansion
  - Capex intensity and integration of AI initiatives
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions
  - Summary sentiment over the past 15 days (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Notable insider buys/sells and any correlation with price moves
  - Any unusual insider activity signals or red flags
- Key takeaways for traders
  - Catalysts and risks (AI deployments, regulatory scrutiny, ad market cyclicality, competition)
  - Valuation context (directionally—P/E, EV/EBITDA, revenue growth, margin trajectory) if data allows
  - Recommended stance (BUY/HOLD/SELL) only when data is present; otherwise, clearly labeled as “data pending”

Appendix: Markdown table (to be filled with actual data)
- I will append a concise table at the end like this once numbers are in:

- Company: META (Meta Platforms, Inc.)
- Periods covered: Latest quarter vs prior quarter; year-over-year
- Revenue: value, YoY change
- Gross Margin: value
- Operating Margin: value
- Net Income: value
- EPS: value
- Free Cash Flow: value
- Cash & Equivalents: value
- Total Debt: value
- Net Cash: value
- R&D as % of Revenue: value
- SG&A as % of Revenue: value
- Insider Sentiment (last 15 days): Positive/Neutral/Negative
- Notable Insider Transactions: list of names, dates, and action
- Key Risks: bullets
- Key Catalysts: bullets

Request for next step
- Would you like me to retry the data retrieval now to pull the latest quarterly balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and insider data for META? If you prefer, I can also proceed with a qualitative overview based on public context while we retry, clearly marking data gaps, and then substitute the numerical section as soon as the data machinery is available.
