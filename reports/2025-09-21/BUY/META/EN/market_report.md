I attempted to fetch META data and the requested indicators, but the data access layer is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. Specifically:
- get_YFin_data for META (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-21) did not succeed.
- Parallel calls to get_stockstats_indicators_report for the eight indicators also failed due to the same underlying data access issue.

Because of this, I don’t have fresh numeric values to generate a live-trend report right now. I can still proceed in two helpful ways:
- Option A: Retry data retrieval now (or after a short interval) and then generate a detailed, data-backed report.
- Option B: Provide a rigorous, qualitative framework and a pre-selected, complementary set of indicators (with interpretation guidance) that you can use as soon as data is available.

Below I’ll provide the recommended 8 indicators (diverse and non-redundant) and how they would inform META’s current market context, followed by a concise interpretation framework you can apply once the data is retrievable.

Recommended indicators (up to 8, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Confirms overall market direction and helps spot golden/death cross setups with the 50 SMA.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend indicator. Useful for confirming the primary trend and acting as dynamic support/resistance in conjunction with the 200 SMA.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum probe. Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points, especially after pullbacks or breakouts.
- macd: MACD line for momentum and trend-change signals (crossovers can indicate shifts when aligned with price action).
- macds: MACD Signal (the smoother line). Crossovers with MACD add confirmation to momentum-change signals.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and divergence; useful to spot early momentum changes, especially in choppy markets when MACD lines are noisy.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index. Momentum gauge with oversold/overbought signals (e.g., crossing 30/70; watch for divergences against price trend).
- atr: Average True Range. Measures volatility, aiding risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and filtering entries when volatility is rising/falling.

Why these are suitable for META (current market context)
- META often experiences shifts between momentum-driven moves and pullbacks tied to broader tech/regulatory sentiment. The combination of trend (200/50 SMA), momentum (10 EMA, MACD family, RSI), and volatility (ATR) provides a well-rounded view:
  - Trend confirmation: 50 SMA and 200 SMA help distinguish sustained uptrends from downtrends and avoid whipsaws in choppy periods.
  - Early momentum signals: MACD components and the 10 EMA help with timely entries/exits when price is breaking relative to recent moves.
  - Momentum strength and reversals: RSI and MACD histograms/divergence offer early warning of deteriorating or strengthening momentum.
  - Risk management: ATR informs how wide to set stops, how much to size positions, and how to adapt to changing volatility regimes around META’s price moves.

Interpretation framework (apply once data is available)
- If price is above the 200 SMA and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA, look for continued upside potential; confirm with MACD crossing above its signal line and RSI trending higher (but not overbought).
- If MACD lines cross bearish while price struggles near the 50/200 SMA, anticipate possible consolidation or trend correction; corroborate with RSI failing to make new highs/diverging from price.
- If ATR is rising with price breaking above resistance or above the upper Bollinger band (if you view those in conjunction with further signals), expect higher volatility and consider tighter risk controls or waiting for a pullback to a MA support.
- Watch RSI around 50–70 in uptrends: if RSI remains well above 50 and rising, the trend has strength; if RSI approaches overbought levels, look for signs of divergence or MACD histogram fading as potential pullback signals.
- If MACD histogram (macdh) is expanding positively along with price, momentum is accelerating to the upside; if it contracts while price makes new highs, be cautious of a weakening trend.
- In range-bound conditions, favor MA crossovers (10 EMA with 50 or 200) as short-term entry signals only when supported by MACD/macdh and RSI non-extreme readings.

What I can provide next (once data is retrievable)
- A full, data-backed report including:
  - Current price vs. key moving averages (price relative to 50/200 SMA and crossovers).
  - MACD/macd_histogram/macd_signal dynamics with recent crossovers and divergences.
  - RSI trend, overbought/oversold readings, and any divergences.
  - ATR-based volatility assessment and its implications for risk management.
  - A synthesized trend outlook (bullish, bearish, or range) with actionable entry/exit ideas and stop-loss suggestions.
  - A Markdown table summarizing the indicators, trend signals, and suggested actions.

Proposed next steps
- Please confirm if you’d like me to retry fetching the data now (or after a short delay). If you prefer, I can proceed with the qualitative framework immediately (as above) and then attach a fully data-driven report as soon as the data fetch succeeds.
- If you’re okay with a retry, I’ll attempt the data retrieval again and then generate the detailed, indicator-driven report for META based on the latest data.
