I tried to fetch META’s Reddit-stock news for 2025-09-21, but the Reddit tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool error). It looks like the data source backend is temporarily unavailable.

Options to move forward:
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately.
- Proceed without Reddit data: I can deliver a detailed, trader-focused analysis based on other public signals (general sentiment drivers, recent news themes, earnings cues, regulatory factors, etc.) and outline what Reddit sentiment would likely add once the feed is available, plus a clean Markdown table of key points.
- Hybrid: I draft the full report focusing on non-Reddit sources and note where Reddit sentiment would be integrated once the tool is back.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry now, I’ll run the Reddit fetch again and then compile the full long report with a Markdown table at the end.
