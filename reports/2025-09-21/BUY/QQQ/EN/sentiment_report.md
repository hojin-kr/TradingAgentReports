I tried to pull the Reddit-based stock news for QQQ on 2025-09-21, but I’m hitting an internal error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) from the Reddit data tool. I can’t retrieve the Reddit-derived sentiment right now.

Here are options to move forward:
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll attempt again and report back).
- Option B: Proceed with a high-quality qualitative analysis using other sources (public news, general ETF news, and sentiment proxies) while we wait for Reddit data.
- Option C: If you have another data source you want me to pull from, share it and I’ll include it.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option B right away and deliver a comprehensive long-form report on QQQ (the Invesco QQQ ETF) focusing on sentiment, recent news, and implications for traders, with a final Markdown table of key points.

Plan for the long report (if you choose to proceed now):
- Executive snapshot: current state of QQQ, notable macro factors affecting tech-heavy indices, and headline risk.
- Social sentiment overview: qualitative read on what people are saying across major platforms, plus any available proxy signals (volume of posts, general tone).
- Daily sentiment themes (last 7 days): recurring topics (tech exposure, FAANG/MSFT/AAPL influence, rate expectations, liquidity, flows).
- Notable news events (past week): fund flows, rebalancing notes, SEC/stock-specific news, index changes, or ETF-level announcements.
- Market context: macro backdrop (rates, inflation data, tech earnings cadence, geopolitical factors) and how they’re shaping QQQ sentiment.
- Potential catalysts and risks: what could move QQQ next (earnings, policy shifts, sector rotations, macro surprises).
- Trader implications and ideas: how to position around near-term sentiment shifts, risk management notes, and example trade theses.
- Data-driven sentiment metrics (qualitative): suggested metrics to watch if we later pull Reddit/Twitter/News sentiment (e.g., sentiment heatmap, topic clustering, notable posters).
- Final synthesis with actionable insights and caveats.
- Markdown table: concise key takeaways, catalysts, risks, and recommended positioning.

If you prefer Option A (retry now), I’ll run the Reddit data pull again and integrate it into the report, then deliver the full analysis with the updated sentiment view. How would you like to proceed?
