Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the data, but I hit a tool-access error.

What happened
- The parallel tool call (which runs multiple data fetches in parallel) returned FileNotFoundError for all requested data sources.
- Individual calls for insider sentiment (Finnhub) and quarterly SimFin statements also failed with the same error.

What this means for QQQ (the ETF)
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions data are typically available for individual stocks (equities). ETFs like QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust) do not usually have the same style of insider filings, so those data streams may not be applicable or available in the same way.
- The SimFin balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement are designed for companies with formal financial statements; an ETF’s structure is different (it holds a basket of securities rather than a single reported set of company financials). Thus, retrieving quarterly “company-level” financials for QQQ may not be meaningful or available.

Options to move forward
1) Analyze a constituent within QQQ for insider data and fundamental details
- If you want insider sentiment/transactions, I can switch to a top holding (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA) and fetch:
  - Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Insider transaction history (past 15 days)
  - Company financials (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow)
2) Provide a comprehensive ETF-focused fundamental overview of QQQ
- This would cover: fund objective, issuer, inception date, expense ratio, assets under management, liquidity, tracking methodology, top holdings and their weights, sector allocation, geographic exposure, yield, and recent performance context. Note that this would not include insider data (since it’s not typically applicable to an ETF).
3) Hybrid approach
- I can present a robust ETF fundamentals overview and, if you approve, drill into one or two top holdings for deeper internal data (insider sentiment/transactions and company financials).

What would you like me to do?
- Please choose one:
  - A) Analyze a specific constituent (e.g., AAPL) for insider data and fundamentals.
  - B) Produce an ETF-focused fundamentals report for QQQ (no insider data).
  - C) Do both: ETF overview plus a couple of top holdings for detailed internal metrics.

If you pick A), please specify the ticker(s) of the constituent(s). If you pick B) or C), I’ll proceed with the ETF-focused report and, if helpful, add a section on notable holdings and their implications for QQQ’s risk/return profile.
