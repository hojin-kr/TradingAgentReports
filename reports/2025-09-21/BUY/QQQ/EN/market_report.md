I attempted to fetch the data for QQQ but ran into a data retrieval error:

- get_YFin_data returned: FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory
- This looks like a data source/environment issue rather than an input problem.

Given the data fetch issue, I can’t generate the actual indicator values right now. I can, however, propose a robust, complementary indicator setup for QQQ (the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ETF) and outline how I’d interpret them once the data is available. If you’d like, I can retry the data pull as soon as the data source comes back up, or you can provide the CSV/data another way.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators) for QQQ
Rationale: This mix covers trend direction, momentum, breakout potential, and volatility, with minimal redundancy. It’s suitable for a tech-heavy allocation like QQQ and can adapt to varying market regimes (range-bound, trending, high volatility).

1) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells you: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance.
- How to use: If price is above 50SMA, bias is up; price crossing below could signal a shift or consolidation.

2) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells you: Long-term trend benchmark; confirms overall market direction (golden/death cross context).
- How to use: Use to filter signals from faster indicators; prefer long setups when price is above 200SMA in an uptrend.

3) close_10_ema
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells you: Short-term momentum; more responsive than the longer SMAs.
- How to use: Look for crossovers with price or with longer moving averages as quick entry/exit cues. Be mindful of noise in choppy markets.

4) macd
- Category: MACD Related
- What it tells you: Momentum and potential trend changes via MACD line crossovers and divergence.
- How to use: Confirm MACD crossovers with price action and other filters; watch for bullish/bearish divergences with price.

5) macds
- Category: MACD Related
- What it tells you: MACD Signal line; smoothing helps validate MACD-driven signals.
- How to use: Use MACD vs MACD Signal crossovers as trade triggers, especially when MACD is rising/falling from zero.

6) rsi
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- What it tells you: Relative strength momentum; overbought/oversold context; potential reversals or strength continuation.
- How to use: Typical thresholds 70/30; look for divergences with price and confluence with trend direction from price action and moving averages.

7) boll
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it tells you: Bollinger Middle (20-SMA) baseline for price-relative- position and breakout context against a volatility-adjusted benchmark.
- How to use: Use in conjunction with bands to identify breakouts or reversals; price riding the band in a strong trend can indicate continued momentum.

8) atr
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it tells you: Market volatility level; dynamic risk/position sizing input.
- How to use: Use ATR to set volatility-based stop losses and to size positions; rising ATR signals expanding range and potentially larger moves.

Notes on interpretation in QQQ context
- In tech-heavy markets, price can whip around around key levels. The combination of 50SMA/200SMA with 10EMA helps balance lag versus reaction, giving you a sense of when to trend-follow versus when to stay cautious.
- MACD and RSI together provide momentum confirmation and overbought/oversold context to avoid chasing false breakouts.
- Bollinger baseline (boll) plus ATR helps you assess whether a move is price-driven with expanding volatility or a false breakout in a low-volatility regime.
- This setup is designed to produce a well-rounded view: trend (sma/ema), momentum (macd, macds, rsi), and volatility (boll, atr).

Next steps
- Once the data fetch issue is resolved, I will:
  - Retrieve the data for QQQ (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-21 or the latest available).
  - Compute the 8 indicators above using get_stockstats_indicators_report (curr_date set to 2025-09-21 or latest; look_back_days chosen to reflect recent context, e.g., 60 days).
  - Generate a detailed, nuanced report describing how the signals align or diverge, with actionable implications and potential entry/exit considerations.
  - Append a Markdown table with the key points (as I’ll finalize after data is in).

Would you like me to retry data retrieval now, or would you prefer to provide data (CSV) or a different data source so I can proceed with the indicator computations and a detailed report? If you’d like, I can also proceed with a hypothetical, non-data-driven interpretation framework using these indicators, but I’d rather base it on actual data when available.
