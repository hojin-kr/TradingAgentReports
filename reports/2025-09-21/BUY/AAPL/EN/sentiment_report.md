Thanks for the nudge. I hit a tool hiccup pulling Reddit-based stock news for AAPL on 2025-09-21:

- The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like a backend issue rather than user input—the data source isn’t accessible at the moment.

How you’d like to proceed
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit/news fetch again immediately and continue with the full, data-backed report as soon as the tool returns data.
- Use an alternative path: If you’d prefer not to wait, I can assemble a high-quality qualitative overview of AAPL sentiment and recent news from other accessible sources (general press coverage, earnings context, product cycle rumors, regulatory environment, etc.) and clearly mark what is data-driven versus inferred.
- Hybrid approach: I can draft the report structure now with a placeholder section for Reddit sentiment, then fill it in right away once the tool is back.

What I can deliver once the data path is open
- A comprehensive long-form report analyzing social media posts, sentiment, and public news about AAPL over the past week.
- Daily sentiment breakdown (positive/neutral/negative) with context from key threads and notable posts.
- Thematic synthesis (e.g., product cycle chatter, services growth, supply chain/news catalysts, leadership commentary, regulatory/regulatory risk).
- Trader-oriented implications: how sentiment shifts could translate into price action, volatility, and potential risk/ reward scenarios.
- A clear "What to watch next" section with actionable signals for trading decisions.
- A final Makrdown table organizing key points for quick reference.

Draft report structure (what you’ll see once data is in)
1) Executive snapshot
- Quick read on sentiment trend, notable catalysts, and immediate implications.
2) Daily sentiment pull (past 7 days)
- Day | Positive | Neutral | Negative | Notable themes
3) Top themes and catalysts
- Theme 1: Product/news cycle
- Theme 2: Services and ecosystem
- Theme 3: Mac/IoT/AI ecosystem and supplier chatter
- Theme 4: Regulatory/policy and macro backdrop
4) Notable posts and discourse highlights
- Reddit threads, influencer/shareholder commentary, and mainstream coverage snapshots
5) News deltas and interpretation
- What drove sentiment on each day; alignment/miss with actual news
6) Trader takeaways and risk flags
- Scenarios, implied volatility considerations, and tactical ideas
7) Conclusion and optional stance (short/neutral/long)
8) Makrdown table: Key points at a glance (see end of report)

Makrdown table (to be appended at the end)
- The table will summarize: Day, Sentiment, Primary Themes, Key News/Catalysts, Potential Trader Implications, Confidence
- Columns can be expanded as needed for clarity

Next steps
- Please tell me which option you prefer:
  1) Retry now and proceed with the full, data-backed report as soon as the Reddit tool returns data.
  2) Proceed with a best-effort qualitative overview using other sources (clearly labeled as such) while we wait for the Reddit tool.
  3) Wait until the Reddit tool is back, then I’ll deliver the complete, data-driven report.

If you want me to proceed right away with option 2 (other sources), I can start outlining the report now and prepare the Makrdown table structure right away. If you’d rather wait, I’ll re-run the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available and deliver the full analysis immediately afterward.
