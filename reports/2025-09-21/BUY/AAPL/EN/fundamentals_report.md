Sorry—there was an issue fetching the data from the tools (FileNotFoundError across the requests). I can retry fetching insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the SimFin balance sheet/cashflow/income statement for AAPL, but I’ll need your go-ahead to retry now or after a short wait.

What would you like to do?
- Retry data retrieval now
- Wait and retry automatically after a short delay
- Proceed with a best-effort report based on available public information (without live tool data)

In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the comprehensive report once data is retrieved:

What the report will include
- Company profile
  - Overview of Apple Inc. (AAPL): business segments (iPhone, Mac, iPad, Wearables, Services), geographic revenue mix, key competitive positioning, and strategic themes (hardware/software ecosystem, services growth, capital return program).
- Basic company financials (latest period)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, cash flow from operations, capital expenditures, and free cash flow.
  - Key balance sheet items: cash & equivalents, marketable securities, total debt, net debt, and liquidity metrics.
  - Capital structure and leverage indicators (debt/EBITDA, interest coverage).
- Financial history (trend analysis)
  - Quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year trends for revenue, gross margin, operating income, and net income.
  - Cash flow evolution: operating cash flow vs. capex, free cash flow trajectory.
  - Dividend and share repurchase activity as part of the capital return program.
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Summary sentiment, notable shifts, and any potential interpretive signals about management confidence or risk factors.
- Insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Notable insider buys/sells, amounts, and possible implications for signaling insider views.
- Trader-focused insights
  - Catalysts and risks (product cycle timing, services growth trajectory, margin dynamics, supply chain and macro risks).
  - Valuation context (how P/E, EV/EBITDA, and cash flow multiples compare to peers and historical norms).
  - Important caveats (one-time items, FX, macro effects, capex intensity).
- Executive summary and actionable takeaways
  - Concise bullets on whether the fundamental backdrop supports a bullish, cautious, or neutral stance for traders observing near-term movements.
- Appendix: Key points at a glance
  - A Markdown table organizing the most important data points and findings for quick reference.

Markdown table (to be appended at the end)
- The table will include columns like: Topic, Key Figures/Points, Potential Implications, and Confidence Level (based on data quality and recency).

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the best-effort report based on the latest available public context (without live insider data)? If you want a retry, I’ll run it again as soon as you confirm.
