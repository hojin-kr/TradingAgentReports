Preference path: Option A (data-driven update when feeds return). For now, apply the plan’s stance and proceed to a risk-managed Sell, with a data-backed re-entry plan to be delivered as soon as reliable signals are available.

Recommendation
- SELL (reduce exposure / underweight) for Alphabet (GOOGL). Do not add new exposure until data signals and earnings visibility improve. Consider hedging to maintain optionality.

Rationale (aligned with the proposed investment plan)
- Near-term valuation risk: Alphabet trades at a premium and is sensitive to any misstep in ad demand, cloud monetization, or AI-driven margins. If AI/cloud monetization doesn’t meet expectations, multiple compression could occur quickly.
- Cloud/AI monetization risk is non-linear: Early margin improvements depend on scale and cost efficiency. Ramp dynamics can be uneven, and near-term earnings momentum is uncertain.
- Ad-cycle exposure: Macro ad softness could weigh on topline; cloud uplift alone may not offset near-term ad weakness.
- Data reliability gaps: Missing/unstable price and sentiment data reduce confidence in timing and risk controls, making new long exposure riskier in the near term.
- Regulatory and competitive headwinds: Ongoing scrutiny adds potential cost and growth headwinds.

Strategic actions (to implement now)
1) Trim and de-risk
- Reduce Alphabet exposure by 30-60% depending on current position and risk tolerance. Move toward cash or a lighter sleeve until data signals and earnings clarity improve.
- Implement a stop framework tied to risk thresholds (e.g., trailing stops or stops based on moving averages with confirmatory data).

2) Introduce hedges to preserve optionality
- Protective puts or a collar strategy to cap downside while leaving room for upside if data improves.
- If you prefer a cost-efficient approach, a covered-call sleeve could be considered to fund hedges while preserving some upside.

3) Data-driven re-entry plan (to be executed once feeds stabilize)
- Await data recovery and run the 8-indicator framework (trend, momentum, volatility, sentiment, etc.) to confirm entry signals.
- Employ a staged re-entry: small initial add-on on a clear confirmatory signal, followed by incremental positions on additional confirmations (price trend, momentum, rising volume, and favorable guidance).

4) Data quality and decision discipline
- Use multi-source corroboration (price data, fundamentals, earnings guidance, cash flow, catalysts) rather than relying on a single dataset.
- Once data returns, apply a structured quantitative check before re-entering.

5) Post-earnings scenario planning
- If Q3 2025 earnings show AI/Cloud monetization progress and solid guidance, re-establish a full position gradually with predefined price triggers.
- If results disappoint, be prepared to further trim or exit, with predefined loss thresholds.

Next practical steps
- Immediate action today: execute a measured Sell/underweight move to reduce risk and shift toward cash-ready exposure while monitoring data feeds.
- Prepare to deploy the data-driven re-entry plan as soon as feeds are back online and validated.

Final note
- The bear thesis highlights the risks embedded in near-term execution and valuation; the plan emphasizes risk controls, hedging, and a data-driven re-entry when signals improve. A disciplined, data-backed approach is preferred over chasing headlines.
