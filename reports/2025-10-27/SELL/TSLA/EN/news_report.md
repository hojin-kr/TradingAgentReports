I attempted to fetch fresh TSLA news from Finnhub and EODHD as requested, but the tool calls encountered errors on this run. I’ll proceed with a comprehensive, trader-focused briefing for TSLA using current macro context and Tesla-specific fundamentals, and I’ll outline the data points you’d typically want to extract from Finnhub/EODHD so you can attach the exact figures when data retrieval is working again.

Executive snapshot
- The global EV backdrop remains constructive but highly competitive. Tesla faces pressure from price-competitive peers in China and Europe, while benefiting from battery price declines and continued demand for high-margin energy products.
- Tesla's growth thesis hinges on volume ramp in existing factories (US, China, Germany), continued gross margin discipline, and the monetization of advanced driver-assistance (FSD) features. Any deviations in demand, regulatory hurdles, or battery costs can swing margins meaningfully.
- Near-term catalysts include quarterly deliveries/production prints, updates on gross margin trajectory, any updates on FSD deployment/regulatory approvals, and progress on new factories or line expansions. The tone of commentary from Elon-era communications and management commentary around capex intensity will matter.

Macro backdrop (relevant to TSLA trading and macroeconomics)
- Interest rates and inflation: Global rate expectations influence EV affordability and consumer credit. Any signs of inflation re-acceleration or a shift in rate-hike/cut cycles can impact EV demand sensitivity to price and financing terms.
- Energy/commodities: Lithium and battery materials remain a key driver of production costs. The trajectory of battery prices (and Tesla’s sourcing strategy, including 4680s, LFP vs NMC mixes) affects gross margins and capex plans.
- China/EU demand: China remains a critical volume driver; regulatory signals or subsidies in China affect unit economics. EU demand benefits from subsidies/credit schemes; exchange-rate movements (USD vs CNY/EUR) can affect international margins.
- Competition: BYD, NIO, XPeng, and legacy automakers expanding EV lineups keep competition intense, especially on price and charging network interoperability. Tesla’s differentiators remain supercharger network scale, software stack, and brand loyalty.

Tesla-specific dynamic (what to monitor in the next 1–4 quarters)
- Deliveries and production trajectory: Compare quarterly production vs deliveries, by region if available. Track progression toward annualized run-rate targets and any bottlenecks at Shanghai/Texas/Germany lines.
- Gross margin and operating margin: Margin discipline is sensitive to product mix (Model 3/Y vs higher-end S/X), material costs, and energy/recurring costs. Watch for any signs of margin compression from price cuts or higher freight costs, and any improvement from cost controls or scale.
- Pricing and incentives: Tesla’s pricing strategy (temporary price cuts, standard vs premium configurations, and regional incentives) materially affects demand and margins. Pay attention to any model-year refreshes or feature bundling that could reaccelerate demand.
- FSD and software revenue: FSD adoption, regulatory approvals, and the monetization of software (subscription vs upfront) remain key optionality. Regulatory milestones in major markets (US/Europe/China) will shape revenue visibility and risk.
- Battery strategy and supply chain: Battery supplier mix, local sourcing (e.g., China vs US vs Europe), 4680 cell ramp, and the use of LFP in lower-cost variants all influence cost structure and capacity.
- Capital expenditure and capex intensity: Any announced expansions (new lines, giga-factories, battery plants) vs efficiency improvements affect long-run output and depreciation profiles.

Risks and scenarios
- Downside risks: Slower-than-expected demand in key regions, higher-than-anticipated battery/material costs, or policy/regulatory headwinds in China/EU. A rapid decline in EV subsidies or a shift in credit eligibility could tighten demand.
- Upside risks: Faster-than-expected software monetization from FSD, better-than-expected cost reductions via scale and vertical integration, or a favorable regulatory stance on autonomous features that unlock software revenue streams.
- Regulatory and geopolitics: Export controls or local content rules could affect margins and capex plans, especially for China-bound shipments or complex supply chains.

Data points to pull from Finnhub and EODHD (for a precise, up-to-date view)
- Deliveries and production by quarter (TTM and YoY changes)
- Gross margin, operating margin, and free cash flow by quarter
- Capex intensity and break-out by major program (vehicle manufacturing vs energy/storage)
- FSD regulatory status, software revenue (subscription uptake, if disclosed)
- Regional sales mix and pricing moves
- Any major supplier or logistics bottlenecks reported

Trading ideas and risk management notes
- If deliveries grow steadily with improving gross margin, TSLA can sustain multiple expansion in a market that rewards high software/content-driven growth.
- If price cuts accumulate or demand weakens, expect multiple compression and potential upside if FSD/software monetization accelerates or margins stabilize through cost reductions.
- Supply chain resilience and regionalization (US/China/Europe) will be a critical swing factor for cost structure and profitability.

Key data to capture (when you re-run the data fetch)
- Quarterly deliveries (units) and production (units) by region
- Gross margin and operating margin by quarter, and year-over-year trend
- Capex by segment (vehicle vs energy/storage)
- FSD revenue and user adoption metrics (if disclosed)
- Latest commentary on battery sourcing, 4680 production, and supply chain updates

Markdown table: Key points to monitor for TSLA (organized for quick reference)

| Theme | Key data points to watch | Implications for TSLA | Signals to watch for (data-driven) |
|-------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Demand and volume | Quarterly deliveries and regional mix; gap to guidance | Drives top-line growth, informs pricing strategy | Delivery beat/miss vs consensus; regional demand shifts (US/China/Europe) |
| Gross/operating margins | Gross margin, COGS, opex, margin by region | Profitability trajectory; impact of battery costs and scale | Margin expansion on cost controls vs compression from price cuts |
| Pricing strategy | Regional pricing, incentives, model mix | Affects demand elasticity and ASPs | Margin stability despite price moves; demand response to pricing |
| FSD/software monetization | Software revenue, takedowns/registrations, regulatory updates | New revenue streams with optionality | Uptake of subscriptions; regulatory milestones enabling monetization |
| Battery and capex | Battery supplier mix, 4680 ramp, LFP/NMC mix, capex cadence | Impacts unit cost, capacity, and long-run margin | Battery cost trends; capacity expansions; unit costs trend |
| Regulatory/geopolitics | China policy, US/EU subsidies, export controls | Affects regional profitability and capex plans | Policy shifts that favor or restrict EV programs; subsidy changes |
| Energy/storage business | Storage deployments, profitability, cyclical demand | Diversifies revenue and improves mix | Storage project wins; capex alignment with vehicle margins |
| Supply chain resilience | Lead times, logistics, supplier reliability | Margin and production continuity risk | Reduced lead times; fewer supply shocks; inventory turns improving |

Notes
- The above synthesis centers on typical macro drivers and Tesla-specific variables that traders monitor. Once the Finnhub and EODHD data fetch succeeds, you can plug in exact numbers (deliveries, margins, capex, FSD revenue, etc.) to quantify the insights and refine the trading stance.
- If you’d like, I can retry data fetches and present a data-driven version with exact figures and updated trend lines as soon as the tool access is functioning again.

Would you like me to attempt another data pull now and then update the report with precise figures? If you have any specific aspects you want emphasized (e.g., FSD monetization, China exposure, or energy storage metrics), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis.
