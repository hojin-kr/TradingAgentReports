I attempted to fetch TSLA data and the requested indicator analyses, but the data retrieval tool returned errors (FileNotFoundError) for all TSLA data calls. I can retry fetching the data now or later—please tell me if you’d like me to try again immediately. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan with the most relevant indicators (8 in total) that provide complementary insights for TSLA, plus how I would interpret them and actions you might consider once data is available.

Selected indicators (8, complementary mix)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale for the chosen indicators
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm whether intermediate moves align with the broader trend.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming the overarching market regime (bullish vs bearish) and for watching for golden/death cross signals when combined with shorter averages.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum gauge. Captures quick shifts in price action and can highlight early entry/exit points when used with longer-term averages.
- macd: Core momentum indicator. MACD line crossovers and the histogram provide signals about momentum shifts and potential trend changes.
- macds: MACD signal line. The cross of MACD vs MACD Signal adds a smoothing-confirmation layer to MACD signals, reducing false positives when used with other filters.
- rsi: Momentum/overbought-oversold gauge. Helps assess potential reversals or continuations, especially when there is a divergence with price or trend signals.
- atr: Volatility measure. Sets expectations for stop-placement and position sizing and informs risk management in TSLA’s typical volatility regime.
- vwma: Volume-confirmed trend. Combines price action with volume, helping confirm genuine moves vs. price moves driven by low liquidity or spikes.

How I would interpret the indicators for TSLA (once data is available)
- Trend context
  - Price above 200SMA and 50SMA: Generally constructive for longs; the larger trend would be considered bullish if supported by VWMA and MACD bullish signals.
  - Golden cross signal (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) would strengthen a bullish thesis; a death cross would call for caution or hedging.
- Momentum signals
  - Price crossing above 10EMA: Short-term momentum turning higher; look for confluence with MACD bullish cross and RSI rising from mid-range.
  - MACD crossing above MACD Signal with positive histogram: Confirms bullish momentum; prefer entries when price is above major moving averages and VWMA is rising.
  - RSI rising into or above 50–70 zone: Indicates strengthening momentum; check for divergences (price making new highs as RSI fails to, or RSI diverging from price) to anticipate reversals in strong uptrends.
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising: Higher volatility; adjust stop distances and position sizing accordingly; be prepared for wider price swings on earnings or news events.
- Volume confirmation
  - Price above VWMA and VWMA trending up: Confirms that price advances are supported by higher/positive volume, increasing the likelihood of sustained moves.
  - Price below VWMA or VWMA flattening/sliding: Signals weaker conviction behind moves; risk of reversals increases without other confirmations.
- Trade construction notes (entry/exit)
  - Look for multi-indicator confluence: e.g., price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD bullish, RSI climbing from mid-range, and VWMA confirming with rising volume. That combination provides a higher-probability long setup.
  - For shorts or exits, watch for price failing to clear key levels (200SMA or VWMA) with MACD turning negative and RSI moving toward overbought territory if the trend shows signs of exhaustion.

Caveats and TSLA-specific considerations
- TSLA is historically highly volatile and sensitive to news (production updates, demand signals, regulatory developments). Treat signals with higher weight on confirmation from multiple indicators and timeframes.
- Always account for events (earnings, guidance, policy news) that can abruptly change momentum; use ATR to manage risk around such events.

Proposed analysis workflow (once data is available)
1) Confirm trend with price relative to 200SMA and 50SMA; verify golden/death cross states.
2) Check short-term momentum via price vs. 10EMA and MACD line vs. MACD Signal, including histogram direction.
3) Validate momentum with RSI and look for divergences vs price.
4) Assess volatility with ATR to set risk controls (stops/position sizes).
5) Confirm with volume via VWMA signal and price relation to VWMA.
6) Synthesize signals to decide on entries, exits, or avoidance (e.g., prefer entries on pullbacks that align with long-term trend and positive volume).

Markdown table: quick reference of the 8 indicators and their roles
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for TSLA | Typical action if signal confirms |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Mid-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests moderate-term uptrend; price below indicates weakness | Consider long on pullbacks with confirmatory signals; use with other filters |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA signals bullish regime; below signals bearish regime | Favor trend-following bias; golden cross strengthens bulls; death cross warns risk |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above 10EMA shows near-term strength; crossing below indicates momentum fade | Look for quick entries on momentum re-acceleration; watch for reversals near major MAs |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD line cross above MACD Signal with positive histogram = bullish momentum; reverse for bearish | Enter on alignment with price trend and VWMA; exit on bearish cross/divergence |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Signal line cross confirms MACD-driven momentum signals | Use as confirmatory filter for MACD entries/exits |
| rsi | Momentum/overbought-oversold | RSI rising toward 70 signals strong momentum; >70 may indicate overbought risk; <30 oversold | Watch for divergences and use with trend context; avoid blindly chasing extreme readings |
| atr | Volatility | Rising ATR indicates higher volatility; lower ATR suggests quieter price action | Adjust stop distances and sizing; be cautious around earnings/news days |
| vwma | Volume-weighted trend | Price above rising VWMA confirms volume-supported uptrend | Prefer entries with VWMA confirmation; weakness below VWMA suggests risk-off conditions |
