Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch the Reddit stock info for TSLA on 2025-10-27, but I’m hitting a tool error (FileNotFoundError) from the Reddit data fetch. I’m unable to retrieve the latest posts and sentiment data at the moment due to that issue.

What I can do now
- I can retry the Reddit data pull (same date) in a moment to see if it was a transient glitch.
- If the retry fails again, I’ll switch to a fallback approach using the most recent available data and clearly mark the limits, then proceed with the broader analysis (social sentiment trend, recent news highlights, potential implications for traders).

What I’ll deliver once data is accessible
- A comprehensive long-form report analyzing TSLA on the current week, focusing on:
  - Social media sentiment: daily sentiment trends from Reddit posts (and any notable topics, threads, memes, or narratives driving chatter).
  - Public sentiment nuances: bulls vs bears, levels of optimism/pessimism, risk-on/risk-off signals in the posts.
  - Recent company news: earnings updates, product announcements, leadership commentary, regulatory developments, and macro factors affecting TSLA.
  - Implications for traders: short-term swing ideas, potential catalysts, risk factors, and how the sentiment and news interplay could affect price action.
  - Fine-grained insights: identify specific subtopics (e.g., vehicle demand, FSD progress, energy products, competition) that are driving sentiment, and potential inflection points.
  - A clear, easy-to-scan conclusion with actionable takeaways.

Appendix: Markdown table
- I will append at the end a Markdown table organizing key points, including sentiment delta, notable topics, recent news highlights, and trading implications.

Next action options
1) I retry the Reddit data fetch for TSLA on 2025-10-27 now. If successful, I’ll proceed with the full report.
2) If you prefer, I can retry with a nearby date (e.g., 2025-10-26 or 2025-10-28) to get the latest available data, then adjust the analysis accordingly.
3) If you want a stopgap now, I can deliver a structured outline and an interim, data-light analysis focused on what’s publicly known about TSLA in the past week, with the plan to fill in sentiment specifics once the Reddit data comes through.

Please tell me which option you’d like, or say “Retry now” and I’ll attempt the data pull again immediately.
