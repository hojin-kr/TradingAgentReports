# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD is a major AI compute player. Near-term revenue visibility is uncertain and margins may face headwinds. Hold with risk controls; re-evaluate only if durable backlog conversion, margin momentum, and ROCm traction prove themselves.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence: Medium.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term visibility is uncertain: AI demand is long-term, but backlog visibility and timing of revenue are not reliable.
- Valuation looks stretched without durable margin expansion or backlog-to-revenue conversion.
- ROCm software moat offers optional upside, but has not yet translated into steady earnings power.
- A milestone-driven path could justify higher exposure, but requires multi-quarter progress rather than a single catalyst.
- Risk controls are advisable: patience with a staged re-entry if clear progress appears.

## Risks To Watch
- Backlog-to-revenue conversion is bumpy and timing can be unpredictable.
- Margin pressure from macro headwinds and AI compute mix.
- ROCm traction remains uncertain; earnings impact depends on broad enterprise/cloud adoption.
- Valuation could compress if durable earnings power does not materialize.
- Execution and supply-chain constraints could delay expected progress.
