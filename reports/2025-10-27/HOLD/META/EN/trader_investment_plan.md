Decision: Hold META right now.

Rationale aligned with the proposed plan:
- Near-term uncertainty dominates: AI ROI timing, ongoing EU regulatory costs, and ad-market cyclicality present meaningful headwinds to a clear near-term margin uplift. The bear case is plausible if ROI lags or regulatory costs rise faster than expected.
- Long-run thesis remains intact: AI-enabled monetization, a durable moat, and expanding AI adjacencies imply upside over a multi-quarter horizon if catalysts prove durable.
- Valuation risks: The market factors in a strong AI/margin uplift, so a sharp surprise on ROI or regulation could compress multiple and cap upside in the near term.

Key catalysts to watch (watch for a re-rating toward Buy):
- Q3 earnings (late Oct 2025): explicit AI ROI progress, capex cadence, and margin trajectory.
- EU regulatory updates: any softening in costs or clear compliance wins that reduce risk premium.
- December AI-targeted ads rollout: early advertiser response and incremental monetization signals.

Risks and imbalances to monitor (avoid surprises):
- AI capex timing and efficiency: if ROI proves slower, margins may face pressure.
- Ad-demand sensitivity: macro softness or cyclicality could dampen pricing power in the near term.
- Reality Labs/other bets: capital allocation risk if ROI doesn’t materialize.

Actionable plan (risk-managed, whether you’re long or on the sideline):
- If you’re already long, keep a small core exposure (risk-controlled) and employ hedges around catalysts (earnings window, regulatory news). Use defined-risk strategies (e.g., collars, calendar spreads) to protect downside while preserving upside if AI ROI accelerates.
- If you’re on the sidelines, wait for clearer near-term catalysts before adding meaningfully; a disciplined entry only when 1–2 independent catalysts confirm durable ROI progress and manageable regulatory costs.

Re-evaluation framework:
- Revisit after Q3 results and EU updates. If AI ROI progress is tangible and margins stabilize or expand despite regulatory costs, consider stepping toward a Buy. If ROI delays persist or regulatory costs rise meaningfully, prepare to trim or reduce exposure. If macro ad demand deteriorates sharply, reassess quickly.

Final takeaway: Hold now with a disciplined, hedged plan around key catalysts. If future data confirms durable AI-driven margin uplift and regulatory risk remains contained, I would reassess toward a Buy. If the opposite unfolds, risk controls should tilt toward reducing exposure or exiting.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
