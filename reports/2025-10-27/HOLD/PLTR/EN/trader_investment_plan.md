Recommendation: Hold PLTR for now.

Rationale (concise):
- The bull case for long-run growth remains credible (Foundry/Gotham expansion, cross-sell potential, governance moat). 
- However, near-term risk is meaningful: profitability timing, potential margin compression from AI/module upfront investments, government-cycle volatility, and competitive pressure could weigh on multiple expansion before ARR accelerates.
- In a high-valuation software context, misalignment between growth and profitability timelines provides downside risk if catalysts do not materialize promptly.

Actionable trader’s plan:
- If you’re already long: modestly trim exposure to reduce downside sensitivity. Tighten risk controls (smaller position size, tighter stops). Do not chase headlines or pilots.
- If you’re not in: avoid large new allocations. Consider a very small starter only if price revisits a defined support with improving volume and a credible near-term ARR/CRM signal.

Catalysts and monitoring (watch closely):
- ARR growth by segment (commercial vs government), net revenue retention, and attach rates from Foundry add-ons and AI modules.
- Gross margin trajectory and free cash flow progress; look for mix shift toward higher-margin offerings.
- Lumen collaboration: concrete bookings, multi-year commitments, realized ARR lift, and impact on sales cycle.
- Regulatory headlines and policy shifts impacting government backlog; have predefined risk triggers.

Risk controls and hedges:
- Use lightweight hedges around key risk dates if appropriate for your mandate (options or protective puts where available).
- Maintain diversification to avoid PLTR being the sole risk driver; reallocate toward names with clearer near-term profitability signals if volatility spikes.

Decision framework and time horizon:
- Horizon: 12–24 months to clarity on ARR acceleration and margin improvement.
- Reassessment triggers: 
  - Upgrade to Buy if sustained mid-to-high single-digit ARR growth with clear margin expansion and positive FCF trajectory, plus credible commercial wins and Lumen bookings.
  - Downgrade to Sell if ARR growth undershoots consistently and margins stagnate or worsen after meaningful time has passed.

Lessons applied:
- Focus on evidence of scale and durable profitability rather than pilots or hype.
- Prioritize margin and cash flow signals alongside top-line growth.
- Use predefined triggers to avoid reactive trading around headlines.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
