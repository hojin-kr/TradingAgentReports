Thanks for the nudge. Quick note: my attempt to fetch the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t pull live Reddit sentiment data right this moment. I can still deliver a strong, detailed PLTR (Palantir) analysis by outlining a comprehensive framework and providing a draft long-form report structure now, and I’ll fill in the day-by-day sentiment and news specifics as soon as the data tool is available again.

Here are two ways we can proceed, pick one:
- Option A: I proceed with a high-signal qualitative/report-style analysis now, clearly marking where live sentiment data would be inserted and what to watch for. Then I’ll slot in exact figures and day-by-day sentiment once the data tool is back.
- Option B: I draft a fully structured long report with placeholders for sentiment and news data, so you can review the methodology and the insights framework immediately and we can drop in the real data later.

If you’d like, I can start with Option A right away. Below is a robust long-form report draft for PLTR, focusing on social sentiment themes, recent company news signals, and implications for traders, followed by a Markdown table of key points. I’ll tag where live data would populate.

Comprehensive PLTR (Palantir) Long-Form Analysis – Draft Outline

Executive snapshot
- Company focus: Palantir builds data analytics platforms (Foundry for commercial/government clients; Gotham for defense/intelligence) with a growing emphasis on AI-driven analytics and enterprise-scale deployment.
- Market context: Enterprise data infrastructure remains a core, high-visibility space but faces macro headwinds (budget cycles,Capex prioritization) and competition from cloud-native data platforms and AI tooling.
- Sentiment posture (placeholder for live data): The narrative around PLTR typically oscillates between optimism about AI-enabled data insight capabilities and caution around profitability/valuation, government contract dependence, and long sales cycles. The current week’s signal will hinge on contract outlook, product wins, and any earnings commentary on efficiency and cash flow.

Social media sentiment overview (qualitative framework)
- Thematic buckets you’ll likely see in posts when sentiment is constructive:
  - Adoption momentum: Posts praising Foundry/Gotham deployment success, customer case studies, and ROI signals.
  - AI narrative: Posts linking Palantir to practical AI-enabled data workflows, model governance, and trust in data outputs.
  - Valuation/stock narrative: Debates about growth versus multiple expansion, comparisons to peers (AI/data infra players), and portfolio positioning.
- Thematic buckets you’ll likely see when sentiment is cautious:
  - Commercial win rates: Skepticism if large commercial deals lag or if press releases focus on pilots without scale.
  - Government exposure: Concerns about government budget cycles, export controls, or procurement hurdles.
  - Profitability and cash flow: Questions about margins, operating leverage, and free cash flow generation trajectory.
- Daily sentiment signals (how to interpret once data is in):
  - Net sentiment score: Positive/neutral/negative skew per day.
  - Engagement intensity: Likes/retweets/replies per PLTR post as a proxy for conviction or crowd churn.
  - Topic clustering: Frequency of posts around “Foundry” vs “Gotham” vs “AI integration” vs “valuation concerns.”

Recent company/news signals (framework for the past 7–14 days)
- Product/technology: Any updates to Foundry, Gotham, or new AI-enabled modules; notable product wins or high-visibility pilots.
- Customer/industry wins: New enterprise or government contracts, expansions with existing customers, or renewals that imply expansion potential.
- Financial/corporate: Quarterly earnings commentary, guidance tweaks, cost optimization measures, capital allocation decisions, share repurchase activity.
- Regulatory/compliance: Any regulatory developments impacting data governance, security standards, or export controls relevant to Palantir’s business.
- Competitive landscape: Headlines about competitors’ AI/analytics offerings affecting Palantir’s addressable market or pricing power.

Implications for traders and investors
- Catalysts to watch:
  - Concrete contract wins or renewals with government or enterprise customers, especially if accompanied by expansions into Foundry’s footprint or higher-value modules.
  - Positive commentary on unit economics, operating leverage, or free cash flow generation from the latest quarterly results or investor day.
  - Early-stage AI product integrations that translate into measurable customer ROI and faster deployment cycles.
- Risks to monitor:
  - Delays in large enterprise or government deployments that push revenue recognition out.
  - Margin compression from competitive pricing or higher SG&A costs as Palantir scales.
  - Shifts in political or budgetary environments that could impact defense/GovTalk segments.
- Trading posture and strategy (contextual guidance; not a recommendation):
  - If sentiment shows rising conviction alongside visible contract momentum and improving margins, consider a staged accumulation approach near support levels, with a price target range anchored to earnings trajectory and cash flow metrics.
  - If sentiment deteriorates without meaningful contract wins, or if guidance signals stress on profitability, risk management strategies (e.g., trailing stops, hedges) become prudent.
  - If Foundry’s enterprise adoption accelerates with higher net retention and expanding add-on modules, it could justify multiple expansion versus peers.

Key data points to collect (to be filled after tool data returns)
- Daily sentiment index for PLTR (date-by-date) with categories: bullish, bearish, neutral.
- Daily post volume and average engagement for PLTR-related posts.
- Top themes and the share of posts by theme (Foundry, Gotham, AI, margins/valuation, government).
- Notable news events in the last 7–14 days (contract wins, product updates, earnings commentary).
- Updated price action context (intraday moves, volume spikes, notable option activity).

Markdown table: Key points for quick reference

Next steps
- If you’d like Option A (live-data-focused analysis), I can proceed with drafting the fully fleshed report as soon as the Reddit sentiment tool is available again and I can pull the latest 7–14 days of data. I will then replace all [placeholder] items with actual figures and day-by-day sentiment.
- If you prefer a quick, data-light summary now, I can deliver a condensed version focusing on qualitative factors, notable narratives, and a framework for interpretation without day-by-day sentiment data.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry fetching live sentiment data as soon as the tool is available (I will auto-insert it into the report and update the Markdown table), or
2) Proceed with a fully qualitative, data-agnostic deep-dive using the structure above (with placeholders for exact numbers), or
3) Provide a hybrid draft that includes the qualitative analysis now and a plan to drop in live data once tooling is restored?

I’m ready to move in whichever direction you prefer.
