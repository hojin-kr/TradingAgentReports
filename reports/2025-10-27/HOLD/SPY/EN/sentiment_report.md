I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock data for SPY across the requested dates, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the get_reddit_stock_info tool is currently failing to access the data source. I can’t pull the daily Reddit sentiment data right now.

Here are the options to proceed:

Option A – Retry Reddit data pull now
- I can retry the parallel fetch (or individual date fetch) in a moment to see if the tool comes back online.
- If successful, I’ll compile a detailed week-long sentiment analysis from Reddit posts (by day), identify dominant themes, notable posts, and any sharp sentiment shifts correlating with price moves or news.

Option B – Proceed with an alternative analysis now
- I can deliver a comprehensive SPY sentiment and news analysis using non-Reddit sources (e.g., major news outlets, market data, Twitter/X, StockTwits, ETF flows) for the past week, plus macro catalysts and options activity insights.
- I will clearly label the data sources and provide a robust interpretation for traders, including potential implications and possible trading considerations.

Option C – Hybrid approach
- I can provide a partial initial report focusing on non-Reddit sources and a plan to fill in Reddit-specific sentiment as soon as the tool is available again. I’ll note the exact data gaps and next steps.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option B right away and start building a long-form report (with daily sentiment proxies, notable news items, and implications for traders) while I attempt a retry of the Reddit data fetch in the background.

To tailor the output, please confirm:
- Do you want the priority to be Reddit-specific sentiment (Option A) once the tool is back, or a broader sentiment/news analysis right now (Option B)?
- Any specific focus areas you want emphasized (e.g., macro catalysts, ETF-flow signals, options activity, volatility signals)?

While you decide, here’s how I’ll structure the final long report once data is in:

- Executive snapshot: current sentiment stance, overarching themes, and key driver risks for SPY.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: by date, with a sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative), top themes, and notable posts or headlines.
- Notable news and macro events: summary of what moved markets in the week (Fed comments, inflation data, geopolitical news, earnings proxy if relevant).
- Sentiment-to-movement analysis: correlation between sentiment shifts and SPY price/actions (and IV, volume metrics where available).
- Trader-oriented insights: implications for risk tolerance, short-term versus swing trading cues, potential setups (breakouts, pullbacks, hedges).
- Risks and caveats: data limitations, possible biases from social sources, and scenario analysis.
- Appendices: data sources, methodology, and a Markdown table of key points.

If you’re ready for me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, say “Retry now,” and I’ll run the parallel call again and report back with the results.
