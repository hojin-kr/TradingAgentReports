# Investment Report: NFLX
## Executive Summary
Near-term tax headwinds and uneven ad demand create GAAP uncertainty for Netflix. Long-term upside from an ad-supported tier, stronger international ARPU, and potential gaming monetization remains appealing. Hold now; upgrade to Buy only after durable events that could move the stock confirm.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- What Netflix does: Netflix provides on-demand streaming of TV shows and movies and is testing an ad-supported tier to reach more viewers.
- Near-term headwinds: Tax effects affecting GAAP profits, a choppy ad market, and uncertainty around the ROI of gaming initiatives.
- Long-term upside: An ad-supported tier could lift revenue, international ARPU may grow, and gaming could add monetizable revenue.
- Risk-managed approach: A staged entry plan tied to durable signals helps avoid paying for optimism before it is proven.

## Risks To Watch
- Tax and currency: Ongoing tax effects on GAAP results and currency fluctuations.
- Ad market and gaming ROI: Ad demand may stay uneven; ROI from gaming could take longer to show.
- Price momentum: Waiting for a clear, sustained uptrend could cause missing the initial move.
- Catalyst dependence: If durable events that could move the stock do not materialize, the outlook could weaken.
