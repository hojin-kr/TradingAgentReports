Decision: HOLD NFLX

Rationale
- The provided investment plan captures credible near-term risks (tax headwind in Brazil, ad-market softness, uncertain ROI from gaming) and emphasizes the need for durable ex-tax profitability and reliable ad/international monetization momentum before committing new capital.
- The stock remains in a regime typical of a consolidation/drag below the 200-day moving average. Until price action reclaims that regime with convincing volume and momentum (e.g., MACD confirmation and favorable RSI behavior), the upside is contingent on catalysts rather than being guaranteed.
- Given the balance of risks and the absence of clear, repeated proof of near-term catalysts, a cautious stance aligns with prudent risk management and capital preservation.

Watchpoints to upgrade to BUY (trigger conditions)
- Price action: sustained reclaim of the 200-day MA with meaningful higher-volume follow-through.
- Momentum: MACD turns positive with a MACD cross and RSI remains within a constructive range (avoiding oversold or extreme overbought levels).
- Catalysts confirming durability:
  - Ad-tier momentum: sustained CPM growth and broader international ad demand.
  - International ARPU: consistent positive trajectory across key regions.
  - Gaming ROI: incremental revenue with clear cost discipline and positive ROI signals over multiple quarters.
  - Cash flow: ex-tax profitability and free cash flow show resilience or growth independent of one-off items.
- Risk controls: maintain tight risk management (e.g., ATR-based stops, modest position size, hedges if desired) and avoid adding exposure before multiple catalysts align.

Operational guidance (if you already hold NFLX)
- If overweight, consider trimming to neutral to avoid anchoring to an uncertain near-term trajectory.
- If flat or underweight, refrain from chasing the dip; wait for the specified upgrade signals before increasing exposure.

How I’ll monitor and adapt
- Apply a multi-factor readout (ex-tax profitability, FCF trajectory, ad revenue momentum, ARPU trends, and gaming ROI) rather than relying on a single metric.
- Use a staged entry approach to shift from HOLD toward BUY only after the above triggers prove durable over more than one data point/quarter.
- If catalysts fail to materialize within a reasonable window, tighten stops or reduce exposure to preserve capital.

Bottom line
Hold Netflix now to preserve optionality while monitoring for durable, multiple catalysts that would justify a shift to Buy. If and when the catalysts validate the bull thesis on a sustained basis, implement a disciplined, staged entry toward a full position.
