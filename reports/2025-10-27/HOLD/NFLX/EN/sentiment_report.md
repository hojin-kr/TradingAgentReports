Thanks for the update. I tried to pull the Reddit stock info for NFLX for the requested dates, but the tool is returning a FileNotFoundError (environment issue) and isn’t returning any data right now. I can’t fetch the Reddit-based sentiment data at the moment.

What I can do next (choose one or a mix):
- Retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available again.
- Proceed with an alternative data collection approach using other sources (e.g., public news headlines, official Netflix earnings/news releases, general social sentiment from platforms like X/Twitter, Facebook, StockTwits, etc.) to build a comprehensive sentiment and news view for NFLX over the past week.
- Build the full long-form report structure now and fill in the Reddit sentiment section once the tool is back, using placeholder notes in that section.

What I can deliver right away:
- An actionable framework for traders, including how to interpret daily sentiment, notable topics driving sentiment, and potential trading implications.
- A ready-to-fill Markdown table (Makrdown) at the end to organize key points once data is available.

Proposed report framework (what I’ll generate once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment trend over the past 7 days, notable shifts, and potential catalysts (product updates, earnings, competitive news).
- Daily sentiment breakdown: for each day, sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative), dominant topics, and any outliers.
- News & events synthesis: brief summaries of major NFLX news (earnings, user growth, pricing, content strategy, partnerships) and tone.
- Social sentiment drivers: what themes are driving sentiment (content library, pricing changes, new features, outages, platform performance).
- Price/volume context: how sentiment aligned with NFLX price moves, intraday highs/lows, and volume spikes.
- Risk and opportunity flags: potential catalysts that could shift sentiment (e.g., new content releases, international growth, ad-supported tier changes) and corresponding risk/entry points.
- Trader implications: likely short-term (1-4 weeks) and longer-term implications, with considerations for options activity, catalysts, and risk management.
- Quick-reference Makrdown table: key data points and takeaways (to be filled with real data).

Suggested Makrdown table structure (to append at the end)
- Date
- Daily Reddit Sentiment (if available) / Alternative sentiment
- Top Topics / Keywords
- News Headlines & Tone
- Price Move (close vs open, % change)
- Volume
- Notable Event/Catalyst
- Analyst/Market Reaction
- Short-term Implication

If you’d like, I can start with a non-reddit-based synthesis now (pulling recent NFLX news, earnings, and public sentiment from other sources) and then re-run the Reddit data as soon as the tool is back. How would you prefer to proceed?
