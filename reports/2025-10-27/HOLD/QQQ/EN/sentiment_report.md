Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull Reddit sentiment data for QQQ across the dates you specified, but the get_reddit_stock_info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can still deliver a thorough, trader-oriented analysis by outlining the methodology, what to watch, and a structured long-form report. When the tool becomes available again (or you provide the data), I can plug in the day-by-day sentiment specifics and update the visuals. Here’s a solid, actionable draft you can use now, followed by a Markdown table of key points.

Overview and current capability
- What I can do now: Provide a comprehensive sentiment-and-news oriented report for QQQ (the Nasdaq-100 ETF), focusing on social-media signals in general terms, the framework to interpret them, and trading implications. I will clearly note where data would be plugged in once available.
- What I cannot do right now: Deliver exact day-by-day Reddit sentiment scores, post counts, or topic distributions for 2025-10-27 through 2025-10-21 because the data tool is unavailable in this session.

Proposed structure of the full report (ready to be populated with day-by-day data once the Reddit tool is back)
1) Executive snapshot
- QQQ is a tech-heavy ETF tracking the Nasdaq-100, with large weights in mega-cap technology and growth names (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL/GOOG, etc.).
- Trading implications of social sentiment: Positive shifts in tech-oriented social chatter often coincide with rallies in QQQ, especially when there is constructive news around AI adoption, software/services earnings beats, or macro risk-on appetite. Negative sentiment tends to precede pullbacks or increased volatility, particularly if macro pessimism overlaps with tech-sector headwinds.

2) Sentiment methodology (how to measure and interpret)
- Data sources (recommended): Reddit, X/Twitter, StockTwits, and other tech-forward forums. Also consider aggregating macro/earnings talk from major financial news comments for triangulation.
- Metrics to capture (per day):
  - Sentiment score: net positive vs. negative posts, normalized to daily post volume.
  - Post volume: total mentions of QQQ and major theme keywords (AI, earnings, regulation, rates, etc.).
  - Top themes/topics: topic modeling outputs (e.g., AI deployment, chip demand, FAANG-leaning earnings, regulatory risk).
  - Momentum indicators: rate of change of sentiment, anomalies around earnings dates or macro data releases.
- Interpretation framework:
  - Positive sentiment spike + rising volume near big tech earnings or AI buzz often supports short-term upside in QQQ.
  - Negative sentiment spikes during rate-hike talk, regulatory fears, or macro shocks can precede drawdowns or elevated volatility.
  - Divergences between sentiment and price (e.g., rising sentiment while price stalls) warrant caution and could imply a setup for mean reversion or a trend continuation depending on corroborating news.

3) Recent news and catalysts to watch (as of late Oct 2025)
- While I don’t have the exact on-site Reddit data plugged in here, the typical catalysts for QQQ around this period include:
  - Tech earnings season outcomes for large-cap constituents (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, etc.) and guidance.
  - AI and cloud-computing demand trends affecting software/hardware suppliers.
  - Macro risk appetite shifts driven by central-bank commentary, inflation data, and geopolitical developments.
  - Regulatory or antitrust news impacting big tech and its growth trajectory.
- Trading takeaway: If news improves around earnings and AI demand, expect positive sentiment momentum to support QQQ; if macro fears or regulatory concerns pick up, sentiment may deteriorate even if earnings are broadly in-line.

4) Daily sentiment interpretation framework (to fill with actual data)
- For each day in the window:
  - Report sentiment score, volume, and key topical drivers.
  - Note any major earnings or macro events that could have driven the sentiment shift.
  - Provide a binary or scaled read on implied short-term momentum for QQQ (e.g., constructive, mixed, or caution).

5) Trader implications and actionable signals
- Short-term trading ideas:
  - Positive sentiment with robust earnings beats and favorable AI/tech news: consider bullish tilt or call-style strategies, with tight risk management (e.g., stop losses based on intraday volatility).
  - Negative sentiment spikes around macro concerns or regulatory fears: consider hedges (e.g., long put hedges on QQQ or protective option positions) or cautious stance until sentiment and news stabilize.
- Medium-term considerations:
  - Look for sentiment-supported breakouts in QQQ if cross-asset risk appetite improves and major tech names report strong guidance.
  - Watch for divergences: when sentiment improves but price fails to confirm, or vice versa, signaling potential reversals or consolidation.
- Risk factors to monitor:
  - A heavy technology tilt means QQQ is sensitive to regime changes in rates, tech earnings surprises/ misses, and AI spend cycles.
  - Broad market shifts (e.g., cyclical sectors outperforming) can dampen tech-heavy flows even with positive sentiment on AI headlines.

6) Data caveats and quality checks
- Reddit sentiment data can be noisy and biased by meme stocks, influencer amplification, or extreme posts.
- Normalize by post volume to avoid misinterpreting sentiment spikes that are simply due to higher engagement on a single news event.
- Use cross-source validation (e.g., compare Reddit sentiment with X and StockTwits sentiment) to reduce source-specific biases.

7) Appendices and data notes
- Include definitions for sentiment score (e.g., -1 to +1 scale), post volume normalization, and the list of keywords used for topic modeling.
- Document any data restrictions or latency considerations.

8) Markdown summary table (key points)
- I’m including a table structure you can fill in once the Reddit data comes back. It will help you quickly scan the drivers, sentiment signals, and actionable implications.

Markdown table: Key points to track (fill after data retrieval)
- Columns: Date, Day’s Sentiment Score, Daily Post Volume, Top Themes, News Drivers, Price Action Context, Implied Short-Term Signal, Suggested Action, Risk Notes
- Example rows (placeholders until data is available):
  - Date: 2025-10-27 | Sentiment Score: [to be filled] | Volume: [to be filled] | Top Themes: [AI, earnings, regulation] | News Drivers: [earnings/takes etc.] | Price Action: [up/down/flat] | Signal: [bullish/mixed/bearish] | Action: [buy/hold/sell/hedge] | Risks: [macro, rate, regulatory]
  - Date: 2025-10-26 | Sentiment Score: [to be filled] | Volume: [to be filled] | Top Themes: [AI buzz, cloud demand] | News Drivers: [earnings preview/implications] | Price Action: [up/down/flat] | Signal: [bullish/mixed/bearish] | Action: [buy/hold/sell/hedge] | Risks: [macro, rate, regulatory]
  - Date: 2025-10-25 | ...

What I can deliver next (once the data tool is back)
- A full, day-by-day narrative for 2025-10-27 through 2025-10-21 with:
  - Daily Reddit sentiment scores and volumes
  - Top themes per day
  - Associated market price action in QQQ
  - An integrated interpretation and actionable trade ideas
- A final Markdown table with the filled-in data and trading implications.

Would you like me to proceed with:
A) A detailed, data-agnostic long report now (as above) with placeholders for day-by-day sentiment to be filled later, plus a fully populated action-oriented summary table? Or
B) A best-effort, data-informed narrative focusing on typical drivers and potential scenarios (without day-by-day sentiment scores), suitable for immediate use while we wait for the Reddit data tool to come back?

If you prefer option A, I’ll deliver the completed report now with the table structure ready to be filled as soon as the data returns. If you want option B, I’ll tailor the narrative toward specific risk scenarios and trading theses for QQQ based on known tech-market dynamics and typical social sentiment patterns around tech earnings and AI headlines.
