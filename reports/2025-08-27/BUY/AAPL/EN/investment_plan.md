# Research Team Decision

Here’s how I see it: both analysts make valid points, but on balance the bull case carries more weight for a long‐term investor who can tolerate some volatility. Palantir’s 48 percent revenue growth, high margins, positive free cash flow and entrenched government contracts argue for a Buy. The bear concerns—sharp recent swings, lofty valuation ratios and insider sales—are real, but largely reflect near‐term sentiment and a tough macro backdrop that should normalize over time. 

So I recommend Buy. 

Rationale  
• Growth still accelerating. U.S. revenue up 93 percent year-on-year, overall up 48 percent, shows genuine traction for Gotham and Foundry.  
• Healthy margins and cash flow. Nearly 19 percent net margin, ROE north of 15 percent and $150 million of free cash flow mean Palantir can fund R&D and weather a downturn.  
• Government footprint plus expanding commercial base. The government business provides a floor, while new corporate clients diversify the mix.  
• Valuation premia fit a high-growth software name. Yes, the P/E is above 45, but at this pace of growth it’s within reason.  

Strategic Actions  
1. Position size and dollar‐cost average. Start with 1.5 percent of core equity—scale in with equal tranches over the next six weeks to mitigate the risk of short‐term swings.  
2. Set a protective trailing stop. A 15 percent trailing stop below your average cost will cap losses if volatility spikes again.  
3. Monitor catalysts. Watch for any formal announcement of the Tesla partnership and quarterly earnings. Strong beats could justify adding; clear misses would prompt a reassessment.  
4. Revisit valuation discipline. If the P/E drifts above 60 without corresponding revenue acceleration, lock in partial profits.  
5. Review macro headwinds. Keep an eye on Fed communications and U.S.-India trade news; adjust exposure if policy risk intensifies.  

Learning from past mistakes, I’m not going to let short-term sentiment distract me. I’ll stick to fundamentals, size positions carefully, and use rules to manage risk. Over time, that disciplined approach should capture Palantir’s upside while protecting the downside.
