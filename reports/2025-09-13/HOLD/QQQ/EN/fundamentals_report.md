I attempted to pull the necessary data for QQQ, but the data tools returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financials for QQQ at the moment. I can’t complete the full fundamental report until those data sources are accessible again.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now or after a short interval to see if the data services come back online.
- Switch to analyzing a specific underlying constituent company (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL) to provide a detailed, data-backed fundamental report.
- Produce an ETF-focused report for QQQ using fund-level metrics (fund profile, top holdings and their weights, sector exposure, expense ratio, AUM, tracking error, dividend yield, liquidity, and recent performance) and then supplement with any available hold-level updates when data tools are restored.

Notes on ETF vs. company data:
- QQQ is an ETF that tracks the NASDAQ-100. It does not have “insider sentiment” or “insider transactions” in the same sense as a single company. The most relevant ETF-level data would be fund holdings, weightings (and how they changed lately), expense ratio, AUM, dividend yield, performance versus the index and peers, liquidity, and tracking error.
- If you prefer, I can still proceed with a structured report focusing on QQQ’s fund-level fundamentals and provide a plan for incorporating underlying constituent data once the tools are available.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry pulling data now, 
2) Analyze a specific constituent company (please specify ticker), or 
3) Produce an ETF-focused QQQ report (fund-level) now and fill in the holdings/data once the tools are functioning again?

If you want me to proceed with option 3 now, I can draft the full ETF-focused report outline and a Markdown table ready to populate, so you can easily fill in the details as data becomes available. Here is a ready-to-fill table structure I would append at the end of the report:

| Section | Key Points / Metrics | Data Availability / Notes | Potential Traders Insight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fund Profile | Fund name, issuer, inception date, AUM, expense ratio | | |
| Holdings Snapshot | Top 10 holdings and weights; concentration risk | | |
| Holdings Trend (last week) | Changes in top weights; new entrants or removals | | |
| Sector Exposure | Industrials, Tech, Communications, etc. | | |
| Dividend and Yield | Dividend yield, distribution history | | |
| Performance | YTD, 1Y, 3Y vs. NASDAQ-100 index | | |
| Tracking Error | Absolute/relative tracking error vs. index | | |
| Liquidity | Average daily volume, bid-ask spread | | |
| Valuation / Risk | Concentration risk, sector/regional biases | | |
| Macro Context | Relevant macro factors affecting tech-heavy index | | |
| Data Sources | Source names (e.g., fund prospectus, index provider, FINRA, etc.) | | |

Please tell me which path you’d like to take, and I’ll proceed accordingly as soon as the data service is available again.
