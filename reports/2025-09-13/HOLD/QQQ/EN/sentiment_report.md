I hit an error trying to fetch Reddit stock info for QQQ on 2025-09-13: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). The tool backend seems unavailable right now.

I can proceed in a couple of ways. Please tell me which you prefer:
- Retry now: I’ll attempt the Reddit data fetch again and report back with a detailed sentiment and news analysis.
- Use a fallback approach: I’ll compile a comprehensive long-form report using other publicly available sources (latest headlines, macro sentiment, ETF fundamentals, and general investor mood around tech/QQQ) and include a structured summary at the end.
- Narrow scope: I’ll focus on a high-level macro view (tech sector drivers, interest rate expectations, earnings trends) and notable headlines from the past week that would impact QQQ, without relying on Reddit data.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with option 2 (fallback), I’ll start assembling a thorough report based on general sentiment drivers and recent news, and I’ll include a Markdown table at the end to organize key takeaways. Just confirm which path you prefer.
