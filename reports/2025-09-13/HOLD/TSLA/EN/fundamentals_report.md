I attempted to fetch the TSLA fundamental data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) for 2025-09-13, but all tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data environment or file sources needed by the tools are currently unavailable or misconfigured.

What this means and potential causes
- The data files or APIs required by the tools are not accessible in the current session.
- There may be a missing configuration (e.g., data directory, API keys, or endpoints) that prevents the tools from returning results.
- The current curr_date or ticker might not be recognized by the data layer, though TSLA is a standard ticker.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval now to see if the issue is transient.
- If you authorize, switch to an alternative data source or provide credentials/keys to restore access for these tools.
- Proceed with a high-level, non-data-dependent fundamental analysis based on public filings and known context (with explicit caveats about data recency).
- Prepare a ready-to-fill report skeleton and a Markdown table template so we can drop in the data as soon as the tools come back online.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry now (I’ll attempt the data fetch again immediately).
- Use an alternative data source (please specify which one or allow me to proceed with a qualitative overview).
- Produce a partial, qualitative fundamental overview (no exact numbers, with caveats) while we wait for data access.
- Get me to generate the full report once the data tools are available again.

In the meantime, here is a ready-to-fill Markdown table skeleton you can drop data into once the data is accessible. It’s organized to capture key points across the requested dimensions.

If you’d like, I can also draft a more detailed outline for the final report sections (each with the exact data fields we’ll populate once the data is back) to expedite the process once access is restored.
