Sorry — I hit a tool error pulling Reddit stock info for TSLA. The get_reddit_stock_info calls returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the day-by-day Reddit sentiment data for 2025-09-07 through 2025-09-13 right now.

What I can do next
- Retry fetching the Reddit data now (single date calls or in parallel) to recover the week-long sentiment dataset.
- If the tool continues to fail, switch to a fallback workflow (documented below) and still deliver a thorough, trader-focused analysis using available signals and a clear methodology.

Recommended fallback approach (if tool remains unavailable)
- Build a week-long sentiment/orientation framework using:
  - Daily Reddit sentiment signal (positive/neutral/negative) from top TSLA threads on r/EV or r/tesla, plus engagement signals (comments, upvotes).
  - Key topics driving chatter (e.g., FSD, Model updates, Tesla Energy, battery tech, supply chain, price cuts).
  - Cross-check with contemporaneous public news headlines and Tesla press releases to identify whether sentiment is news-driven or purely social.
  - Note notable events (quiet weeks vs. product/earnings/AI-related catalysts) that could shift sentiment.
- Deliver a comprehensive narrative with:
  - Daily sentiment trends and anchors
  - Thematic drivers, with example post themes
  - The relationship between social sentiment and news events
  - Implications for traders: momentum, reversals, risk factors, and potential catalysts
  - Shortlist of tactical ideas (entry/exit ideas) grounded in sentiment shifts and news

What I can output right now (structure you’ll get once data is in)
- A long-form analysis report detailing:
  - Summary: overall week sentiment, notable shifts, and potential implications
  - Day-by-day sentiment breakdown (positive/neutral/negative) with key topics per day
  - News/events alignment: what happened on or around those dates and how it influenced sentiment
  - Sentiment catalysts: product previews, regulatory developments, earnings hints, or macro factors affecting Tesla
  - Risk assessment: sentiment fragility, potential for whipsaw around new announcements
  - Trader-oriented takeaways: likely next moves, watchpoints, and risk controls
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference

Proposed Markdown table (template, no data filled yet)
- Date | Daily Sentiment (P/N/Neg) | Top Topics | Notable Posts/Volume | News Highlights | Trend Implications | Trading Takeaways

Would you like me to:
1) Retry pulling the Reddit data now, and proceed with the full long report as soon as I have the data, or
2) Proceed immediately with the fallback, delivering the structured analysis and a filled template table based on a best-effort synthesis from non-Reddit signals?

If you prefer, I can also try a narrower retry (e.g., just 2025-09-07 and 2025-09-08) to verify the tool is functioning, then expand to the full week once confirmed.
