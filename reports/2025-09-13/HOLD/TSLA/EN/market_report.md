I’m seeing a data retrieval issue on the backend right now. The get_YFin_data call (and parallel stockstats calls) are returning FileNotFoundError, which prevents me from pulling TSLA’s recent price data and computing the indicators live. I can still outline a solid plan and provide a structured, scenario-based interpretation once data is available, or proceed with a scenario-based wash using typical TSLA patterns. Here’s what I propose now:

Selected indicators (8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- vwma

Rationale for this set
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Establish mid-term and long-term trend context. The 50SMA above the 200SMA suggests an uptrend (often with support levels); a cross of 50SMA over 200SMA (golden cross) is a classic bullish cue, while the opposite (death cross) is bearish.
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum gauge. Helps identify quicker shifts in price direction and potential entry points when used with the longer SMAs.
- macd and macdh: Provide momentum direction and strength. MACD line crossovers with the signal line (macds) are useful, and macdh shows momentum magnitude; together they reduce noise when confirming trend changes.
- rsi: Momentum/overbought-oversold gauge. Useful for spotting potential reversals and for divergence analysis, especially in trending markets where price can stay extended longer.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA) acts as a volatility-adjusted reference. Price flirting with or breaking above/below the middle line helps gauge breakout potential or consolidation.
- vwma: Volume-confirmed trend. Price action aligned with rising VWMA strengthens conviction, while divergences between price and VWMA can warn of weakening momentum.

What to watch for TSLA (scenario-based framework)
- Bullish setup (if data supports it):
  - Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA; 50SMA above 200SMA (positive trend posture).
  - 10EMA trending above price or crossing upward, signaling bullish momentum.
  - MACD line above its signal line, with a positive MACD histogram (macdh rising).
  - RSI above 50 and ideally trending upward, but not necessarily overbought (watch for RSI hovering near 70 as a caution sign).
  - Price riding near or above the Boll middle, with occasional touches to the upper band, indicating ongoing volatility with upside potential.
  - VWMA rising in tandem with price, confirming volume participation behind the move.
- Bearish setup (if data supports it):
  - Price below 50SMA and 200SMA, with 50SMA below 200SMA (downtrend posture).
  - 10EMA slipping toward or below price; potential cross-down in the short term.
  - MACD line crossing below the signal line, with a negative/macdh turning down.
  - RSI trending down toward 40-50, with risk of breaking toward 30 if momentum accelerates to the downside.
  - Price testing or closing near the lower Boll band, with the middle band acting as resistance on any bounce.
  - VWMA flattening or declining while price remains weak, signaling waning volume-backed momentum.
- Neutral/range scenario:
  - Prices oscillating around the 50SMA with 200SMA still above/below but no strong crossovers.
  - MACD histogram small and shrinking; RSI hovering in a mid-range (45-60).
  - Boll bands contracting; price moving within a tight range around the Boll middle.
  - VWMA flatlining, indicating subdued volume participation.

Next steps
- I can re-run the data fetch and compute the eight indicators as soon as the backend data access is restored. If you’d like, I can keep the indicator set fixed and provide a fully data-driven, TSLA-specific trend and signal readout once the data is available.
- Alternatively, I can provide a scenario-based interpretation using representative patterns (without live numbers) to guide entry/exit ideas now, and then replace with exact readings once data loads.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry data retrieval now and deliver a full data-driven TSLA analysis as soon as the CSVs are available, or
2) Proceed with a scenario-based, pattern-driven TSLA briefing using these eight indicators (without live numbers) until data retrieval succeeds?

Markdown table: key indicators and their roles
| Indicator | Role | What to watch for in TSLA context |
|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Trend filter / mid-term trend | Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend; cross above/below can signal trend changes; use with 200SMA for cross-trend confirmation. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA indicates bullish long-term context; a 50SMA crossing above/below 200SMA adds confidence to bullish/bearish stance (golden/death cross). |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; look for 10EMA crossing price or crossing above/below longer SMAs for timely entries/exits. |
| macd | Momentum direction | MACD line crossing above/below its signal line indicates momentum shifts; positive/negative MACD histogram reinforces timing when used with price trend. |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Magnitude of momentum; rising macdh supports bullish moves, falling macdh supports bearish moves. Use as a confirmation alongside MACD. |
| rsi | Momentum / overbought-oversold | RSI rising toward 70 suggests momentum strength but risk of overbought; RSI dropping toward 30 can signal oversold conditions; watch for divergences. |
| boll | Volatility anchor (middle band) | Price relative to Boll middle helps gauge breakouts vs. consolidation; sustained moves near/through the upper band imply strength, lower band implies weakness. |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend | Price action aligned with rising VWMA reinforces sustainable moves; divergence between price and VWMA can warn of waning participation. |

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll adapt as soon as I can fetch TSLA’s data. If you want, I can also attempt a lightweight, non-datum-dependent qualitative read tied to these indicators once you confirm.
