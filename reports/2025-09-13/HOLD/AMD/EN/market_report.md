I attempted to fetch AMD data (AMD) from Yahoo Finance to generate the indicators, but the data retrieval tool is returning a FileNotFoundError (no such file or directory). I’ve retried several times with no success. This looks like a service issue on the data provider side rather than a user error. I can proceed in one of two ways:

- Retry now (or after you confirm a time) to see if the data service comes back online.
- Proceed with a purely indicator-based framework and trading guidelines for AMD using the chosen indicator set, if you’d like to review the plan while we wait for data access to be restored.

In the meantime, here is a concise, well-rounded indicator suite tailored for AMD (to use once data is available). I’ve chosen 8 indicators to provide complementary insight without redundancy.

Selected indicators (8 total) and rationale for AMD
1) close_50_sma
- What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why for AMD: AMD often moves with a discernible mid-term trend influenced by product cycles, data-center demand, and AI/compute cycles. The 50 SMA helps confirm trend direction and filter noise from shorter moves.

2) close_200_sma
- What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify golden/death cross setups.
- Why for AMD: Useful for assessing strategic trend context (bullish long-term trend vs. potential regime shifts due to earnings or capex cycles). Helps avoid choppy entries in a volatile stock.

3) close_10_ema
- What it measures: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action.
- Why for AMD: Provides timely signals to catch faster moves around earnings, AI-related catalysts, or product launches. Best used with longer-term filters to reduce whipsaws.

4) macd
- What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; signals trend changes.
- Why for AMD: MACD crossovers can highlight shifts in momentum around catalysts (e.g., data-center demand inflections, new product announcements).

5) macds
- What it measures: MACD signal line (smoothing) for crossover confirmation.
- Why for AMD: Helps reduce false entries by requiring MACD to cross the signal line before acting, especially in sideways or low-volatility periods.

6) macdh
- What it measures: MACD histogram (momentum strength and divergence).
- Why for AMD: Divergences between price and MACD histogram can pre-empt momentum changes, useful around earnings or guidance updates.

7) rsi
- What it measures: Relative momentum; overbought/oversold conditions.
- Why for AMD: In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated; use along with trend filters (50/200 SMA) to avoid overtrading. In a down cycle, RSI can help identify potential reversals or continuations when corroborated by MACD.

8) vwma
- What it measures: Volume-weighted moving average to confirm price with volume.
- Why for AMD: Volume spikes around catalysts (earnings, product launches, AI demand) can validate price moves. VWMA helps differentiate genuine momentum from price moves driven by speculative volume.

Notes on how to use these together (high-level guidance)
- Trend confirmation: Look for price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA to bias long; price below them to bias short. Use 10 EMA for entries within the trend.
- Momentum confirmation: Use MACD, MACD signal, and MACD histogram in conjunction with RSI to confirm strength and potential reversals.
- Volume context: Confirm breakout moves or trend changes with VWMA to ensure volume supports the move.
- Risk management: Given AMD’s volatility around earnings and AI cycles, use ATR (if you expand beyond 8 indicators) for dynamic stops and position sizing when data is available.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now and then generate a full indicator report (with current AMD data) and a detailed trend analysis based on the eight indicators above.
- Alternatively, I can provide a more scenario-based, rule-of-thumb trading framework for AMD using these indicators (e.g., entry/exit criteria) that you can apply immediately once data is accessible.

Proposed quick rules of thumb for AMD (without generating real-time signals)
- Bullish setup: Price above 200 SMA and 50 SMA with 10 EMA crossing above, MACD line above the signal, RSI rising but not overbought (e.g., < 70), and price confirming on VWMA with rising volume.
- Bearish setup: Price below 200 SMA and 50 SMA with 10 EMA crossing below, MACD line below the signal, RSI falling toward/through 30, and VWMA confirming a price move with rising volume on downside days.

Would you like me to retry the data retrieval now (or at a specific time), or would you prefer I proceed with a purely rule-based AMD framework using these indicators and provide a structured table of signals and interpretation once data becomes available?

Appendix: quick reference table for the eight indicators (roles at-a-glance)
- close_50_sma: Trend direction, dynamic support/resistance (medium term)
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; trend regime context
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum; quick entry/exit signals
- macd: Momentum/change of trend; crossovers as signals
- macds: Signal line crossovers for MACD confirmation
- macdh: Momentum strength/divergence via histogram
- rsi: Momentum/overbought-oversold context
- vwma: Volume-confirmed price action; validates move strength

Markdown table (summary)
- Indicator -> Purpose -> Use case for AMD
- close_50_sma -> Trend direction/support -> Confirm mid-term trend; filter entries
- close_200_sma -> Long-term trend -> Assess strategic bias; avoid counter-trend trades
- close_10_ema -> Short-term momentum -> Timely entries around catalysts
- macd -> Momentum/trend changes -> Entry/exit confirmations with MACD line
- macds -> MACD signal confirmation -> Reduces false positives
- macdh -> Momentum strength/divergence -> Early warning of momentum shifts
- rsi -> Momentum level (overbought/oversold) -> Divergence checks with trend context
- vwma -> Volume-backed moves -> Validate breakout/move strength

If you want, I can proceed with data fetching as soon as the retrieval issue is resolved, and then I’ll generate a full, detailed AMD report using these indicators, including a practical set of entry/exit examples and a concise table of observations.
