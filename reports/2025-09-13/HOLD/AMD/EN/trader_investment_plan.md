Assessment aligned to the AMD plan you shared: the balance of risks and optionality still favors patience. I am maintaining a Hold stance until clearer signs of margin inflection and broader ecosystem adoption emerge.

Decision: Hold

Rationale (why this stance is justified now)
- Near-term margins: The transition to higher-margin MI accelerators and any corresponding manufacturing/R&D costs keep gross and operating margins vulnerable in the near term.
- Competitive moat: Nvidia remains a strong competitive benchmark in GPUs, and macro/cloud headwinds can delay AMD’s refresh cycles or limit ASP upside.
- Bull thesis not yet proven: While MI roadmap and ecosystem wins offer long-term upside, adoption beyond anchor customers and sustained margin leverage are not guaranteed in the near term.
- Clear upside optionality exists: If margins stabilize and MI ramp translates into broader AI workloads and cloud wins, a Buy thesis could materialize.

Key catalysts and triggers to upgrade to Buy (watch for evidence within the next 4–8 quarters)
- Margin inflection: Sustained improvement in gross and operating margins with clear leverage from MI mix.
- MI ramp with breadth: Higher ASPs and utilization from MI450/MI355X extending beyond initial anchors into broader cloud/enterprise deployments.
- Diversified revenue base: More cloud vendors and verticals signing sizable, durable AI workloads, reducing concentration risk.
- Platform adoption: Broad, multi-party AI workloads and software ecosystem traction beyond a couple of anchor customers.

Risk controls and exit plan
- Establish explicit stop/hedge levels to cap downside if GM or growth accelerates falter.
- Use hedges (puts or collars) to preserve upside while limiting downside risk.
- Reassess quarterly with objective data; shift to Buy only when catalysts align and risk controls remain intact.

Monitoring cadence
- Short term (1–3 quarters): track margin signals, MI ramp indicators, and new cloud/enterprise deals.
- Medium term (6–12 months): assess whether the broader platform trajectory translates into durable profitability and diversified demand.
- Long term (12+ months): if AI compute cycle proves durable with sustained profitability expansion, reevaluate toward a Buy with conviction.

Learnings applied
- Avoid overreliance on a single catalyst; require a multi-lever validation (margin, mix, and diversified demand).
- Margin trajectory remains a cornerstone; profitability progression enables multiple expansion.
- Maintain guardrails for macro and competitive headwinds with defined risk management.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
