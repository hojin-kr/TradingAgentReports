# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD makes computer chips for AI and data centers. Near-term margins could be pressured by competition and macro challenges, so the stock should be held until margins improve and MI adoption broadens.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold. Confidence: Medium.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term margin pressure: Potential mix shifts toward MI accelerators and higher R&D/manufacturing costs could weigh on margins in the near term.
- Competitive landscape: Nvidia’s strong position in GPUs remains a meaningful hurdle for AMD’s share gains.
- Macro and cloud demand: Cloud spending and broader economic headwinds can delay AI refresh cycles.
- Long-term upside exists: Durable AI compute tailwinds and MI-driven demand could lift profits over time, but near-term proof is not yet solid.
- Patience preserves upside: Waiting for clear, multi-quarter proof of margin strength and broader MI adoption minimizes risk.

## Risks To Watch
- No near-term margin improvement: If margins stay flat or worsen, the thesis weakens.
- MI adoption limited: If MI gains stay concentrated with few customers, pricing power and margin upside may be limited.
- Competitive pressure persists: Ongoing competition from Nvidia could keep ASPs under pressure.
- External headwinds: Macro/cloud weakness or security-related delays in refresh cycles could slow demand.
- Execution risk: If AI workloads do not materialize broadly across multiple clouds and verticals, upside may be limited.

## Simple Action Plan
- Monitor margins: Track gross and operating margins each quarter and link changes to MI mix where possible.
- Track MI breadth: Look for more deployments of MI accelerators across multiple cloud and enterprise customers, with visible pricing and utilization progress.
- Diversified AI workloads: Observe traction across a wider set of vendors and industry verticals, not just a single big deal.
- Risk controls: Maintain a moderate position size; set price-based stops to limit downside and consider straightforward hedges if available.
- Upgrade triggers: Move to Buy only if, over two or more quarters, margins improve in a sustained way, MI adoption broadens beyond anchor customers, and there is clear progress in a diversified AI workload base with no meaningful new headwinds.
- Cadence: Reassess in the next 1–3 quarters; conduct a fuller review within 6–12 months.
- Practical execution: Use a simple upgrade checklist and document data-driven evidence before changing stance.
