Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch AMD’s Reddit stock-info for 2025-09-13, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like an internal tool issue rather than a user input problem. I can proceed in a few ways:

Options
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now (same parameters). 
2) Switch to a broader sentiment and news analysis using available sources and provide a robust framework with educated inferences until the tool comes back up.
3) Wait for the tool to be fixed and then run the full, data-backed analysis.

Which would you prefer?

In the meantime, here’s a ready-to-use structure and a starter table I’ll fill in with live data once the Reddit tool (or an alternative data source) is operational. This will help you see the full report flow and what to expect.

Long-form AMD sentiment & news analysis structure (to be completed with live data)
- Executive snapshot
  - Quick read on current sentiment, notable themes, and key catalysts from the past week.
  - Snapshot of how sentiment aligns with any recent AMD news or events.
- Daily sentiment trends (past 7 days)
  - For each day: Positive, Neutral, Negative counts; notable spike days; likely drivers (product launches, earnings hints, supply chain notes, etc.).
- Top Reddit threads and themes
  - Most-referenced topics (AI/GPUs/ datacenter, Ryzen/consumer CPUs, supply chain, pricing, competition with Nvidia/Intel, crypto/mining chatter, etc.)
  - Representative sentiment quotes (summarized) and their potential impact on perception and trading behavior.
- News roundup (last 7 days)
  - Key company announcements, product launches, partnerships, earnings hints, policy/regulatory notes, or macro-driven headlines affecting AMD.
  - Short assessment of how the news could shift sentiment or price in the short term.
- Sentiment vs. price context
  - Overlay of sentiment signals with price/move context (intraday volatility, gaps, put/call activity if available, volume spikes).
  - Short-term risk signals (e.g., rising negative sentiment around a major catalyst).
- Thematic insights and implications
  - Core drivers: AI demand for AMD’s data-center GPUs/MI accelerators, Ryzen/APU consumer momentum, gaming segment trends, and acceptance of next-gen product lines.
  - Competitive dynamics: Nvidia, Intel, and other peers; supply chain resilience; pricing tactics; OEM demand.
  - Macro considerations: AI capex cycle, semis demand environment, geopolitical or trade considerations.
- Trader-focused takeaways
  - Short-term (days to weeks): sentiment-driven volatility, potential pullbacks on negative threads, upside on bullish narratives around AI adoption.
  - Mid-to-long term: product roadmap execution, data center win rates, gross margin trajectory, and capital allocation signals.
  - Potential trade ideas (with caveats): directionally aligned with sentiment shifts, options activity hints if available, or risk-reducing strategies around event risks.
- Risks and caveats
  - Data quality concerns, survivorship bias in social chatter, and the lag between sentiment signals and price moves.
  - Key risk factors to monitor (earnings cadence, supplier news, AI market competition, regulatory or geopolitical shifts).

Provisional Makrdown table (structure only; fill with live data when available)
- This table will be appended at the end of the full report, organizing key points for quick consumption.

| Aspect | Key Observation | Sentiment Tilt (Positive/Neutral/Negative) | Potential Trading Implication | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reddit sentiment overall | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Daily sentiment highs/lows | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Top themes (AI GPUs, datacenter, gaming) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Major news events (past 7 days) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Price action context (if data available) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Market cues (volatility, volume) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Key risk factors | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

Next steps
- Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want, I can retry the Reddit data fetch immediately and then proceed to assemble the full report with live data.
- If you’d rather proceed without the Reddit data right now, I can deliver the complete structured report with placeholders and a more detailed narrative based on recent AMD news and general market context, and then plug in the live sentiment once the tool is back.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit fetch now, or should I proceed with the data-backed outline and placeholders?
