Thanks for asking to continue. I attempted to pull the latest fundamental data for AMD (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) using the available tools, but I hit a system error (FileNotFoundError) on all tool calls. Because of that, I can’t currently fetch the latest figures to populate a fully data-driven report.

What I can do now:
- Provide a thorough, trader-focused framework for AMD’s fundamentals, including the specific data points you’d want to capture once the tools are available.
- Offer a detailed qualitative snapshot of AMD’s business and the kinds of signals those data points typically reveal for traders.
- Share a ready-to-fill Markdown table template you can paste into your notes and populate with the actual figures once the tool issue is resolved.

If you’d like, I can also proceed with a best-effort qualitative overview based on publicly known context up to 2024 and explain exactly what to look for in the data once the fetch works again.

Proposed comprehensive AMD fundamentals report structure (what I will include once data can be pulled)
1) Company profile and business model
- Core products: CPUs (Ryzen for consumer, EPYC for servers), GPUs (Radeon/AMD AI accelerators), semi-custom (gaming consoles), other accelerators.
- Manufacturing model: fabless design; relies on TSMC for foundry capacity; impact of node improvements and yields on margins.
- End markets and customers: PC gaming, data center, enterprise, embedded, and OEMs; exposure to hyperscalers vs consumer demand.
- Competitive landscape: Nvidia (GPUs/AI accelerators), Intel (CPUs, data center), others; role of AI/ML workloads and GPU/accelerator demand.

2) Recent financials (summary once data is retrieved)
- Income statement highlights: revenue trends by segment, YoY growth, gross margin, operating margin, R&D intensity, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, net income.
- Balance sheet snapshot: liquidity (cash and equivalents, short-term investments), debt levels (short- and long-term), capitalization, working capital dynamics.
- Cash flow: cash from operations, capex (R&D vs. tangible asset investments), free cash flow evolution, dividend/share repurchase activity.
- Key profitability and efficiency metrics: ROIC, gross margin trend, operating margin, cash conversion cycle, inventory turns.

3) Balance sheet deep-dive (latest quarter/annual)
- Asset quality and liquidity: current ratio, quick ratio, debt maturity profile.
- Intangible/intangible-like assets and goodwill.
- Contingent liabilities and off-balance-sheet considerations (as disclosed).

4) Cash flow dynamics
- Operating cash flow drivers (recurring revenue, working capital changes).
- Capital allocation: R&D cadence, capex intensity, acquisitions or strategic investments.
- Free cash flow vs. dividend/repurchase policy and its sustainability.

5) Income statement trend analysis
- Revenue by product line and geography, margin contribution by segment.
- Price/mix effects, ASP changes, and supply/demand dynamics.
- R&D and capital intensity drivers.

6) Insider sentiment and insider transactions
- Overview of sentiment from public filings (positive/neutral/negative signals).
- Recent insider buys/sells and potential implications for management confidence or signaling.
- Any notable patterns around product cycles, capital allocation, or strategic pivots.

7) Risk factors and catalysts
- Macro demand risk in PCs vs data centers, AI cycle timing, supply chain constraints, foundry risk.
- Competitive threats, technology transitions (e.g., new node introductions, next-gen accelerators).
- Potential catalysts: data center AI deployment ramps, gaming GPU refresh cycles, product introductions, strategic partnerships.

8) Valuation context and scenarios
- How AMD historically trades relative to peers; sensitivity to data center growth, GPU demand, and ASPs.
- Base vs bull/bear scenario notes based on top-line growth, margin trajectory, and FCF yield.

9) Trader-oriented takeaways
- What data points would most influence momentum and risk (e.g., quarterly revenue surprises, margin expansion, cash flow stability, insider signal changes).
- Key red flags to watch (e.g., deteriorating balance sheet, cash burn, rising debt, or a negative change in insider sentiment).

10) Appendices (data table)
- A concise table listing the most relevant metrics, their latest figures, YoY changes, and qualitative implications for trading.

Proposed Markdown table to organize key points (ready to fill after data is retrieved)
- Columns: Area, Metric / Data Point, Latest Actual, YoY or QoQ Change, Interpretation for Traders, Potential Catalysts/Risks

- Example rows (placeholders until data is populated):
  - Company profile: Products by segment; Notes on diversification and exposure.
  - Revenue: Total revenue; by segment; YoY change; margin implications.
  - Gross margin: Latest margin; trend; drivers (mix, pricing, cost controls).
  - Operating margin: Latest; trend; major drivers.
  - Net income: Reported figure; YoY change; earnings quality notes.
  - Cash from operations: Amount; trend; quality of earnings.
  - Free cash flow: Amount; payout policy; sustainability.
  - Balance sheet: Cash and equivalents; debt levels; liquidity ratios.
  - Insider sentiment: Summary signal; notable changes.
  - Insider transactions: Recent buys/sells; potential implications.
  - Risks: Summary of top risks identified from data.
  - Catalysts: Upcoming events or expected drivers.

Current status and options
- Status: Tool calls to fetch AMD’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the three SimFin statements are failing due to a FileNotFoundError on the backend.
- What I can do now:
  - Provide the above structured qualitative AMD fundamentals overview and the ready-to-fill template so you can proceed immediately with a draft while we wait for the data tools to come back online.
  - Or, if you prefer, I can retry fetching data as soon as the tooling environment is functioning again and then deliver a data-backed report in the same structure.

Would you like me to proceed with:
A) The qualitative AMD fundamentals overview and the fill-in-ready report template (no live numbers yet), or
B) Wait for the tools to be fixed and deliver a full, data-driven report as soon as the data can be retrieved?

If you want, I can also tailor the qualitative overview more toward a specific angle (e.g., data-center AI accelerators, gaming GPU cycle timing, or AMD’s balance sheet risk) to align with your trading focus.
