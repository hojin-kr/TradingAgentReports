I attempted to fetch the data and the indicator reports for AAPL, but the data backend returned a FileNotFoundError. That means I couldn’t load the latest price history or compute the indicators right now. I can retry immediately or proceed with a structured framework based on the chosen indicators and typical interpretations for AAPL in a market context like today. Let me first propose a robust 8-indicator setup and then lay out how to interpret them once data is available.

Selected indicators (8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale for the selection
- The 50 SMA and 200 SMA give you a clear view of mid- and long-term trends (trend confirmation, support/resistance dynamics, and potential golden/death cross signals).
- The 10 EMA provides a responsive view of short-term momentum to help identify quicker entry/exit hints in a trending context.
- MACD and MACD Signal (macd and macds) deliver momentum signals and crossovers. Together they help confirm trend changes when aligned with price action.
- RSI adds momentum strength and potential reversal signals via overbought/oversold levels and divergence checks.
- ATR measures volatility to inform risk management, position sizing, and dynamic stop placement.
- VWMA confirms price moves with volume, helping distinguish genuine moves from price noise by validating with traded volume.

Nuanced, data-driven interpretation framework (once data is available)
- Trend backbone (price vs moving averages)
  - If price sits above both the 50 SMA and the 200 SMA, and the 50 SMA sits above the 200 SMA, the prevailing view is bullish with a higher probability of continuation.
  - If price trades below both averages, or if the 50 SMA crosses down below the 200 SMA (death cross), the downside bias strengthens.
  - The position of the 10 EMA relative to price helps gauge short-term momentum within the broader trend. A bounce of price off the 10 EMA can be a near-term entry for a continuation move in a strong trend; a drop below the 10 EMA in a choppy market may signal consolidation or a reversal risk.
- Momentum signals (macd, macds)
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal line is a bullish momentum cue; crossing below is bearish.
  - When MACD is positive and rising while price is above the moving averages, the trend is likely strengthening.
  - In a low-volatility environment, rely on concordance with RSI and price action to avoid false positives.
- Relative Strength (RSI)
  - RSI above 70 indicates overbought conditions; RSI below 30 indicates oversold conditions. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for longer, so look for bullish/bearish divergences with price to anticipate reversals.
  - Watch for RSI divergence with new price highs/lows as a potential warning of trend exhaustion.
- Volatility and risk management (ATR)
  - Higher ATR implies wider price ranges; adjust stops and position sizes accordingly to avoid premature stopouts.
  - A contracting ATR can precede a breakout; paired with VWMA confirmation, you can spot low-risk breakout opportunities.
- Volume confirmation (VWMA)
  - When price moves are supported by rising VWMA, it strengthens the conviction of the move (volume-backed trend).
  - Divergences between price and VWMA (e.g., price rising but VWMA failing to rise) can warn of a weakening move or a potential reversal.

Trade decision considerations (framework for entries/exits)
- Buy signals (bullish setup)
  - Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA with 50 SMA above 200 SMA, and price resting above the 10 EMA.
  - MACD crosses above its signal line while price is above moving averages; RSI not yet in overbought extreme and rising.
  - VWMA agrees with price action (volume-supported move); ATR shows manageable to moderate volatility.
- Sell/exit signals (bearish setup)
  - Price below 50 SMA and 200 SMA with 50 SMA crossing below 200 SMA.
  - MACD crosses below its signal line while price remains below major moving averages.
  - RSI failing to advance in an uptrend or forming bearish divergence; VWMA weakens as price declines; ATR spikes indicating higher risk and potential stop-placement adjustment.
- Risk management notes
  - Use ATR-based stop distances to avoid premature exits in volatile periods.
  - Consider position sizing adjustments when ATR is elevated to preserve capital during swings.

Next steps
- I can re-run the data fetch and compute the eight indicators as soon as the data backend is available again. If you’d like, I can retry immediately and then provide a data-driven, point-by-point analysis with current readings, crossovers, and actionable signals.
- If you prefer proceeding now regardless of live data, I can deliver a more concrete, scenario-based plan (with hypothetical threshold readings) to guide entries/exits once you confirm you want to act on a given setup.

Appendix: key indicators to monitor (for quick reference)
- close_50_sma: mid-term trend; dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: long-term trend baseline; golden/death cross context.
- close_10_ema: short-term momentum signal.
- macd: momentum trend indicator.
- macds: MACD signal line for crossovers.
- rsi: momentum strength and potential reversals.
- atr: volatility and risk management metric.
- vwma: volume-confirmed price action.

Markdown table: key points at a glance
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret (high-level) | How it informs decisions for AAPL |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | 50-period simple moving average | Trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Bullish when price above and 50SMA above 200SMA; look for pullbacks to 50SMA as potential entries in uptrends |
| close_200_sma | 200-period simple moving average | Long-term trend baseline | Bullish trend if price stays above 200SMA; watch for golden cross with 50SMA as a trend-confirmation signal |
| close_10_ema | 10-period exponential moving average | Short-term momentum | Quick entries on price rejections/off the 10 EMA; beware in choppy markets |
| macd | MACD line reflecting momentum | Positive slope/cross above zero is bullish | Use crossovers with price above moving averages to cue entries; confirm with RSI and VWMA |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smooths MACD for entry/exit timing | Cross above/below is a timing filter when used with MACD and price position |
| rsi | Relative Strength Index | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold signals | RSI >70 may warn near-term pullback in uptrends; RSI <30 may signal potential bounce or reversal, check trend context |
| atr | Average True Range | Market volatility | Guides stop placement and position sizing; rising ATR suggests wider stops |
| vwma | Volume-weighted moving average | Volume-confirmed price action | Confirm moves with increasing VWMA; divergence between price and VWMA can warn of weakness |

Note: I’m ready to retry data retrieval and provide a fully data-backed, point-by-point analysis as soon as the data backend is available. Would you like me to attempt the fetch again now? If you prefer, I can also proceed with a scenario-based, data-agnostic assessment tailored to current market conditions for AAPL.
