Sorry—I’m hitting a tool error with the Reddit sentiment fetch. The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t pull the daily Reddit posts for AAPL dates. I can’t fabricate sentiment data, but I can still move the analysis forward in a few helpful ways.

What I can do now
- Provide a robust framework for the full report and a clear plan for filling in sentiment once the tool is functioning again.
- Start a sentiment-agnostic, fundamentals/news-based analysis you can combine with social sentiment later.
- Prepare a structured Markdown table (Makrdown) to organize key points so you can drop in Reddit sentiment data as soon as the tool is available.

Recommended next steps
- I can retry the Reddit data fetch shortly if you’d like me to attempt again, or you can specify an alternative data source if you have one.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative analysis based on known catalysts around AAPL in early-to-mid September 2025 (e.g., product announcements, earnings cadence, service segment developments, supply chain, macro tech sentiment) and clearly label all assertions as non-sentiment-specific until the Reddit data is in.

Proposed structure for the long report (to fill in after sentiment data is available)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment tone, notable positives/negatives from social channels, and how that aligns with recent company news.
- Daily sentiment dive (past 7-8 days): quantify sentiment mood (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and highlight top themes per day (e.g., product speculation, supply chain updates, service growth, AI features, regulatory concerns).
- Core drivers analysis: what’s driving sentiment (new product rumors, pricing, services revenue, iPhone cycle timing, AI integration, privacy headlines, etc.).
- News & events synthesis: correlate sentiment with actual news events (launches, earnings, guidance changes, partnerships, regulatory items).
- Risk/opportunity mapping for traders:
  - Short-term catalysts and sentiment inflection points.
  - Potential reversals or confirmatory signals.
  - How sentiment interacts with price action (e.g., overreaction, capitulation, whipsaw risk).
- Quantitative inputs (where possible): sentiment score ranges, volume indicators, cross-referenced with any available price action signals (if you have data).
- Conclusions & actionable takeaways for traders/investors.

Draft Makrdown table (to append once data arrives)
- Date
- Source (Reddit subreddit or thread title)
- Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative)
- Key Themes/Topics
- Post Volume (approximate)
- Implied Market Impact (Short-term / Long-term)
- Notable Mentions (e.g., "iPhone 16 rumors," "services growth," "AI features," "price cuts," etc.)
- Data Quality/Notes (any caveats about data sampling)

If you’d like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, I can do that immediately. Otherwise, tell me which path you prefer:
- Retry Reddit sentiment tool now
- Proceed with a sentiment-agnostic analysis plus the upcoming structured sentiment table
- Provide any alternative data sources you want me to incorporate

Your call.
