I tried to fetch the latest data for AAPL (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financials) as of 2025-09-13, but the internal data tools returned a FileNotFoundError for all requests. Specifically, attempts to call:
- get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment
- get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions
- get_simfin_balance_sheet
- get_simfin_cashflow
- get_simfin_income_stmt

failed with the same file-not-found error. I don’t have valid results to report from those sources at this moment.

What you can do next
- Retry now or shortly: The issue may be temporary. If you’d like, I can attempt the tool calls again to fetch the data in real time.
- Try a different data source: If you have alternative data feeds or can paste in the latest figures, I can integrate them into the report immediately.
- Proceed with a placeholder-fueled draft: I can produce a comprehensive report framework with detailed analysis guidance and clearly labeled placeholders. Once the data tools return data, we can plug in the numbers and finalize the report.

In the meantime, here is a comprehensive report framework you can review. It’s designed to be filled in with the actual figures once the data sources are functioning again. It includes sections you would typically expect for a fundamental analysis and is tailored for traders who want granular, actionable insights.

Draft report framework (to be filled with actual data)
1) Company profile
- Ticker: AAPL
- Sector/Industry: Technology hardware and services
- Business model: iPhone hardware sales + ecosystem services (App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, etc.), wearables, and peripherals
- Competitive positioning: Strong brand, integrated hardware-software ecosystem, significant cash generation, sizable R&D and capital allocation

2) Basic company financials (quarterly)
- Revenue by segment (e.g., iPhone, Services, Wearables, Mac, iPad)
- Gross margin and operating margin trends
- Net income, earnings per share, and any notable one-time items
- Cash and equivalents, total debt, and liquidity indicators
- Free cash flow generation vs. CapEx

3) Income statement (quarterly) – what to look for
- Revenue growth rate vs. prior quarter and year-ago quarter
- Gross profit and gross margin trajectory
- Operating expenses as a percent of revenue; R&D and SG&A discipline
- Operating income and margin
- Net income and earnings per share (diluted)

4) Balance sheet highlights (quarterly)
- Total assets vs. total liabilities
- Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments
- Debt levels (short-term and long-term), interest coverage
- Shareholders’ equity movements (share buybacks, issuances)

5) Cash flow statement (quarterly)
- Operating cash flow trend
- Free cash flow (FCF) calculations and FCF margin
- Cash used in investing activities (CapEx, acquisitions)
- Cash provided by financing activities (debt issuance/repayment, dividends, buybacks)

6) Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
- Summary of net sentiment (buy vs. sell signals)
- Key insiders with notable activity
- Short-term implications for price action and consensus shifts

7) Insider transactions (past 15 days)
- List of insiders with purchases/sales
- Context: size of trades, relative to insider holdings
- Potential implications for confidence in the business and capital allocation strategy

8) Historical financial history (context)
- Revenue and earnings trend over the last 4–8 quarters
- Margin stability and any unusual volatility
- Cash flow consistency and balance sheet strength

9) Profitability and efficiency metrics
- Return on equity, return on invested capital, gross/operating margins
- Asset turnover and cash conversion cycle (if relevant)

10) Liquidity and financial health
- Current ratio, quick ratio
- Interest coverage and debt maturity profile
- Share repurchase activity and dividend policy

11) Insider sentiment and transactions interpretation for traders
- If insider sentiment is bullish and insider purchases are increasing, consider it supportive of the longer-term view, especially if the fundamentals remain solid.
- If insider sells dominate or sentiment is neutral without accompanying business progress, treat as a caution signal; look for corroboration from revenue/FCF trends.
- Evaluate the data in the context of iPhone cycle timing, Services growth, and macro demand conditions.

12) Risk factors and caveats
- Product cycle risk (dependence on flagship hardware)
- Regulatory and antitrust considerations
- Supply chain and macroeconomic sensitivity
- Currency exposure in global operations

13) Signals and takeaways for traders
- Short-term indicators to watch (volume spikes, earnings timing, guidance changes)
- Long-term investment thesis supported by cash generation and capital allocation
- Potential buy/hold/sell considerations contingent on data once available

Proposed Markdown table (to be populated with actual data once retrieved)
| Topic | Key data points to fetch | How to interpret | Trader takeaway | Data status / Gaps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Insider sentiment (15d) | Net buy/sell, notable insiders | Bullish if sustained buying among top executives | Aligns with positive fundamentals, confirm with revenue/FCF | Pending data |

| Cash flow (quarterly) | Operating cash flow, free cash flow, CapEx | FCF driver of value and returns | Supports dividend/buyback capacity; assess FCF margin | Pending data |
| Revenue by segment | iPhone, Services, Wearables, others | Services growth + hardware mix shift | Services acceleration can offset hardware cyclicality | Pending data |
| Key profitability metrics | ROE, ROIC, gross/operating margins | Margin stability and efficiency trends | Sustainable profitability supports higher multiple | Pending data |
| Risks and catalysts | Product cycle timing, regulatory, macro | Identify which catalysts drive upside/downside | Align trading stance with risk/reward profile | None yet |

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry the data fetches now to populate the report with actual figures.
- Alternatively, provide any numbers you have from your own data sources, and I’ll integrate them into the above framework and complete the analysis.

Would you prefer me to retry the data retrieval now, or would you rather provide alternative data sources or numbers so I can finalize the report structure with concrete figures?
