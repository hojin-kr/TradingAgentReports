Sorry about that — I hit an error fetching Reddit data for SPY on 2025-09-13: FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source backing the get_reddit_stock_info tool isn’t accessible right now.

What I can do next:
- Retry fetching the Reddit data immediately to see if the issue is temporary.
- If you prefer, switch to a different data source or method for sentiment (e.g., other social platforms or news wires) if you grant access.
- Or proceed with a robust report skeleton now, and I’ll fill in the Reddit sentiment once the data tool is available again.

Options for moving forward:
1) Retry now: I’ll attempt the Reddit data fetch again for SPY on 2025-09-13 and then produce the full long-form report with a Makrdown table at the end.
2) Proceed with a comprehensive analysis plan and structure (without the Reddit data yet), so you can review the approach and I’ll populate with exact figures as soon as the data tool works.
3) You specify alternative data sources (e.g., a different social platform or news feed) and I’ll use those for sentiment, if accessible.

If you’d like me to proceed with the latter two options, here’s the structure I’ll deliver (and I’ll fill in specifics once data is available):

- Executive summary
- Day-by-day sentiment overview (past week) with key drivers
- Top themes in social posts about SPY (risk, inflation, Fed expectations, market breadth, volatility)
- Public/news highlights this week affecting SPY (macro data, earnings hints, geopolitical events)
- Sentiment vs. price action correlation (SPY ETF)
- Implications for traders and investors (short/medium/long-term)
- Risk factors and counterpoints
- Makrdown table: Key points, data sources, date range, and actionable insights

Please tell me which path you want (retry, alternate data source, or proceed with the plan). If you want me to retry now, I’ll do that and report back with the updated findings as soon as they’re available.
