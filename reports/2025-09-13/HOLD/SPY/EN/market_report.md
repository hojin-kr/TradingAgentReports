I tried to fetch SPY data to generate the indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError in the environment. This looks like a tool-side issue rather than a SPY-specific problem. I can retry the data fetch now, or proceed with a plan and a qualitative framework while we resolve the data access. Let me know your preference. In the meantime, here is a carefully designed indicator set and a plan tailored for SPY (the broad U.S. equity market ETF), plus a structured table of key points.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance; helps filter trades in choppy markets.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark; identifies golden/death cross setups and strategic trend confirmation.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Responsive short-term momentum; captures quick shifts and potential entry points; useful for timing when used with longer averages.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Role: Momentum changes via EMA differences; crossovers signal potential trend changes; good for confirming with other filters in quiet markets.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Role: MACD signal smoothing; crossovers with MACD line can trigger trades; helps reduce false positives when used with other indicators.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Role: Momentum strength and potential reversals; overbought/oversold signals with divergence considerations; works well with trend context.
- boll
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Role: Middle Bollinger Band as a dynamic center; baseline for price movement; combined with bands to spot breakouts or reversals.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Role: Measures true range volatility; informs risk management, stop placement, and position sizing; complements trend/momentum signals.

Rationale for SPY context
- SPY reflects the broad market, so combining a trend backbone (50/200 SMA) with short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD, RSI) gives a balanced view of both the macro trend and near-term twists.
- Bollinger-based volatility (boll) plus ATR (atr) helps gauge breakout risk and adjust risk controls as volatility shifts, which is especially important in periods of regime change (e.g., rate moves, earnings-related volatility).
- Including both MACD and its signal (macd, macds) provides a robust view of momentum changes, while RSI provides a complementary momentum perspective that can flag divergences with price trends.
- Using VWMA could add volume-confirmation, but the chosen set already provides diversity across trend, momentum, and volatility without redundancy.

Nuanced plan for interpretation (when data is available)
- Trend confirmation: Monitor where price sits relative to 50 SMA and 200 SMA. A sustained price above both with 50SMA crossing above 200SMA (golden cross) strengthens a bullish bias; a cross below (death cross) strengthens a bearish bias. Use 10 EMA to time potential entries on pullbacks toward support.
- Momentum checks: Look for MACD line crossing above MACD signal as a bullish momentum signal; look for RSI moving out of oversold/overbought zones in the direction of the trend, with attention to potential divergences (e.g., price making new highs while RSI fails to).
- Volatility and risk management: Use boll to gauge breakout potential when price moves beyond bands with accompanying volume (when VWMA is used later). Use ATR to set stops and sizing relative to current volatility—higher ATR implies wider stops and smaller position sizing to maintain risk targets.
- Confluence filters: Favor setups where multiple indicators align (e.g., price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD bullish crossover, RSI > 50 but not extreme, and Bollinger bands indicating a breakout or swing continuation). In choppy markets, rely more on ATR-based stops and the trend confirmation from longer SMAs to avoid false signals.

What I can deliver once data is retrieved
- A detailed, timestamped trading narrative describing the latest readings for each indicator.
- A nuanced assessment of the current SPY regime (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) with context about recent volatility, momentum, and trend strength.
- A specific set of trade signals (up to 8 indicators) with entry/exit/threshold criteria aligned to your preferred risk tolerance.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key insights, indicators, and interpretation notes.

Markdown table: Key indicators, roles, and interpretation (plan-only)
- Indicator | Category | Role | How to interpret for SPY
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests mid-term uptrend; price below suggests potential weakness; use cross with long-term trend (200SMA)
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above 200SMA signals longer-term bullish context; below indicates bearish context; cross with 50SMA for signals
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum timing | Quick momentum shifts; use with longer averages to filter noise; pullbacks toward 10EMA as potential entries
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum shift signal | MACD line crossing above MACD signal is bullish; crossing below is bearish; confirm with price trend
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal smoothing | Supports robustness of MACD-based signals; use for filtering false crossovers
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength and reversals | RSI crossing above/below 50 is a basic gauge; overbought/oversold levels (70/30) provide additional context; watch for divergences
- boll | Volatility Indicators | Centerline and breakout context | Price interaction with Boll middle band as baseline; moves toward/through bands suggest breakout/reversal potential
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility-based risk management | Higher ATR implies wider stops and adjusted position sizes; use to size positions and set risk controls

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now and, if successful, generate the full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators above and a detailed, nuanced trend analysis for SPY as of 2025-09-13.
- Please tell me:
  1) Should I retry the data fetch immediately? (Yes/No)
  2) Do you want me to adjust the date range or look-back window if the fetch succeeds (e.g., last 180 days, YTD, or a specific date)?
  3) Any specific risk tolerance or preferred signal thresholds you want me to honor (e.g., only take signals with MACD and RSI alignment)?

If you’d like, I can proceed with another data fetch attempt right away and then deliver a full, data-backed report once the data is retrieved.
