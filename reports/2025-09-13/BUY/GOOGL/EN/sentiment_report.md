Thanks, I tried to fetch the Reddit-based stock news for GOOGL on 2025-09-13, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (environment issue). I retried multiple times and it’s still failing. I don’t want to stall your analysis, so here’s what I can do right now and how we can proceed to deliver a thorough long-form report.

What I can do now
- Provide a detailed, trader-focused framework for the Alphabet (GOOGL) social sentiment and news analysis that will be ready to fill with Reddit data as soon as the tool is available.
- Compile a rigorous methodology, daily sentiment interpretation, and implications for different trading horizons (intraday, swing, longer-term).
- Prepare a robust Makrdown-compliant report structure with a filled template table at the end, so you can drop in the Reddit data as soon as the tool is fixed.

Proposed plan to move forward (choose one)
Option A: Wait for Reddit tool to come back online and then deliver the full long report
- I’ll pull Reddit data for GOOGL for the past week (and specifically 2025-09-13 if available) and synthesize:
  - Daily sentiment scores and topic drivers
  - Key threads/themes (AI/ML, cloud, ad market, regulatory risk, earnings expectations, leadership/company announcements)
  - Relative sentiment vs. broader market and peers
  - Any notable sentiment-shifts around news events
- Then I’ll deliver the complete long report with a final Makrdown table of key points.

Option B: Proceed using non-Reddit sources for a near-term deliverable
- If you’d like, I can proceed with what I can reliably access right now from non-Reddit sources (e.g., news headlines, public statements, major press releases, and general social chatter that’s not Reddit-based) to produce an initial version of the report today. I’ll clearly label data sources and note any gaps due to the Reddit tool error.
- I’ll still include a detailed Makrdown table at the end.

Option C: Provide a high-signal draft now with a placeholder for Reddit data
- I can deliver a near-final report focusing on overall sentiment and news themes with placeholders where Reddit data will go. Once Reddit data is available, I’ll plug it in and deliver a revised, final version.

What I can deliver in the meantime (structure and initial content)
- Executive snapshot
  - Current sentiment posture (qualitative)
  - Key risk and opportunity levers for GOOGL (short, medium, long-term)
- Sentiment framework
  - How to interpret Reddit-derived sentiment (e.g., average sentiment, volatility around news, topic drift)
  - Daily sentiment scoring approach and thresholds to trigger trades
- News and sentiment themes (past week)
  - AI/cloud/advertising demand signals
  - Earnings cadence expectations (if any announcements occurred in the last week)
  - Regulatory and antitrust context (typical signals to watch)
  - Any notable corporate actions (product launches, partnerships, leadership notes)
- Trading implications
  - Short-term catalysts and blockers
  - Risk factors and hedging considerations
  - Suggested positioning ranges (e.g., neutral-to-long bias on longer-term AI/cloud strength vs. near-term volatility around headline risk)
- Data quality notes
  - Data coverage gaps due to Reddit tool outage
  - Confidence bands and interpretation caveats

Draft Makrdown table (to be filled with Reddit data)
- I’ll append a final table like this at the end of the full report, with a row per day and a summary of sentiment and drivers:
  - Date
  - Source (Reddit, News, X/Twitter, etc.)
  - Sentiment score (e.g., -1 to +1)
  - Top themes/topics
  - Notable headlines or events
  - Implication for trade ( bullish/bearish/neutral )
  - Confidence level
  - Notes

Next step
- Please tell me which option you’d prefer (A, B, or C). If you’re happy to proceed with Option B (non-Reddit sources now), I’ll start assembling the near-term report immediately and clearly label data limitations, then I’ll plug Reddit data as soon as the tool comes back online. If you want to wait for Reddit data, I’ll proceed with Option A as soon as the tool is healthy again and deliver the full, Reddit-integrated long report.

If you want me to proceed now with Option B (non-Reddit sources), I can start drafting the full report in this session and deliver a complete document with the table template ready for Reddit data insertion.
