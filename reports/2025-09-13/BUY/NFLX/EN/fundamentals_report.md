I attempted to fetch the NFLX fundamentals using the available data tools, but I hit a system error:

- The parallel pull and subsequent individual calls returned FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory for all data sources (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cashflow, income statement).

What I can do now

Option A: Retry now
- I can attempt the data retrieval again immediately to see if the issue was temporary. If it fails again, I’ll report the error and propose alternative approaches.

Option B: Proceed with a qualitative framework
- If you’d prefer, I can deliver a comprehensive, tactics-focused report on Netflix (NFLX) based on a solid fundamentals framework, clearly labeling any data gaps and what we would need to fill in once data is accessible. This would cover:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Recent revenue drivers (adoption of streaming, content spend, licensing)
  - Profitability (gross margin, operating margin, EBITDA quality) and cash flow health
  - Balance sheet posture (debt, liquidity, working capital)
  - Cash flow statement interpretation (free cash flow quality, capex intensity)
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions (qualitative interpretation framework, what to watch if data becomes available)
  - Competitive landscape and secular trends impacting NFLX (growth of ad-supported tiers, international penetration, price competition)
  - Week-over-week decision angles for traders (what data points would most move the stock, what to watch in the upcoming earnings cadence)
  - A structured, fillable Markdown table at the end with key takeaways and data gaps

What I recommend you choose

- Do you want me to retry data retrieval now (Option A)?
- Or would you prefer I deliver the Qualitative Framework (Option B) right away, with placeholders and a plan to populate the numbers as soon as data sources are accessible?

If you choose Option B, I’ll proceed with a detailed NFLX fundamentals report, clearly noting any data gaps and the implications for trading decisions. I can also prepare a Markdown table at the end that organizes key points, insights, and gaps for quick reference.
