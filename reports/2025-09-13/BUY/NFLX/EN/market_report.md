I’m hitting a tool error right now fetching NFLX data from Yahoo Finance (FileNotFoundError). I’m not able to generate the live indicator readings until that data retrieval succeeds. I can proceed in one of these ways if you’d like:

- Retry the data fetch now and run the full 8-indicator analysis as soon as the data is available.
- Use a cached/historical window or a shorter date range to at least outline the current regime (with the caveat it won’t reflect the full year).
- If you can provide a CSV of NFLX price data, I can run the indicators immediately against it.

In the meantime, here is the plan I would execute once the data fetch succeeds, plus the exact indicators I’ll include and why they’re suitable for NFLX at this time.

Selected indicators (8 total, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for NFLX to gauge the intermediate trend as the stock moves through earnings cycles.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark. Will help validate whether the stock is in a longer-term uptrend or downtrend and whether any pullbacks are within a bullish/bearish context.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. A responsive short-term momentum gauge. Good for spotting quick shifts in NFLX’s momentum around catalysts (earnings, content releases, guidance changes).
- macd: MACD line. Momentum detector; crossovers signal potential trend changes. Helpful to confirm trend direction with price action in a volatile stock like NFLX.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Shows momentum divergence/strength relative to the MACD line. Complements the MACD cross signals to avoid false entries in choppy markets.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator highlighting overbought/oversold extremes and potential divergences. Useful for spotting pullbacks in uptrends or breakdowns in downtrends, especially around earnings or guidance surprises.
- atr: ATR. Volatility gauge that informs risk management (position sizing and stop placement). Important for NFLX where volatility can spike on earnings or large news cycles.
- vwma: VWMA. Volume-weighted trend confirmator. Combines price action with volume to validate breakouts or trend changes, helping distinguish genuine moves from noise.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A nuanced narrative of NFLX’s current regime across trend, momentum, volatility, and volume.
- A cross-checked interpretation of each indicator’s read on the price action, including any divergences or confirmations.
- Trade-context ideas (entry/exit ideas) aligned with the combined read of the eight indicators, plus practical risk management considerations (e.g., stop placement using ATR, position-sizing cues from volatility).

Provisional decision framework (when data is live)
- Trend view: If price trades above both 50SMA and 200SMA, with 50SMA above 200SMA (golden-cross context) and VWMA confirming via higher volume on rallies, consider long-leaning bias.
- Momentum corroboration: MACD rising or positive with a bullish MACD histogram (macdh positive and increasing) supports entries; RSI above 50 but not in extreme overbought territory strengthens the case.
- Short-term timing: A price crossing above the 10EMA adds a potential near-term entry point, particularly if MACD/macdh confirm and VWMA is rising with volume.
- Volatility/risk: Use ATR to set stop-loss bands; higher ATR suggests wider stops and potentially larger position sizing adjustments.
- Risk controls: If RSI is overbought with price failing to sustain above 50SMA/200SMA and MACD shows fading momentum, consider caution or a partial exit; look for a bullish confirmation on a pullback rather than a continued push in that scenario.

Proposed 8-indicator summary (for quick reference)
- Trend: close_50_sma, close_200_sma
- Momentum: macd, macdh, rsi
- Short-term timing: close_10_ema (used in conjunction with MACD/macdh + VWMA)
- Volatility/Position sizing: atr
- Volume-confirmation: vwma

Appendix: Key points table (structure you’ll see in the final report)
- Indicator: The indicator name
- Purpose: What it helps determine (trend, momentum, volatility, etc.)
- What to look for (bullish/bearish signals, crossovers, divergences)
- NFLX context notes: Any stock-specific considerations (earnings cadence, catalysts, volatility profile)

Markdown table (to organize key points)
- Indicator | Purpose | Signal Interpretation | NFLX Context Notes
- close_50_sma | Trend direction & dynamic support/resistance | Price above = bullish tilt; price below = bearish tilt | Watch around earnings for pullbacks toward this level
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend/bias | Price above = long-term uptrend; below = downtrend | Golden/death cross signals on cross with 50SMA
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above = positive near-term momentum; crossovers signal entries | Sensitive to catalysts; use with longer-term filters
- macd | Momentum trend changes | MACD line > signal line = bullish; crossovers signal entries | Validate with price action and VWMA
- macdh | Momentum strength/divergence | Increasing histogram = strengthening momentum; decreasing = weakening | Divergence with price can precede reversals
- rsi | Momentum / overbought-oversold | RSI > 70 = overbought; < 30 = oversold; divergences matter | In strong trends, overbought can persist; use with trend filters
- atr | Volatility/risk management | Higher ATR = wider stops; lower ATR = tighter risk controls | Adjust sizing to volatility regime
- vwma | Volume-confirmed trend | Price moves with rising VWMA and volume = stronger breakout/trend | Important around earnings and content release cycles

What I need from you to proceed
- Please retry the data fetch for NFLX (start date and end date) or provide a CSV of NFLX price data if you have one.
- If you want, I can also proceed with a narrower date window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to give you a near-term sense of the regime while we resolve the data fetch.

I’ll execute the full 8-indicator analysis and the detailed trend report as soon as the data retrieval issue is resolved. If you’d like me to proceed with the fallback options (shorter window or a provided CSV), tell me and I’ll move forward immediately.
