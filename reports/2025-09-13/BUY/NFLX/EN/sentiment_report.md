Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock news for NFLX on 2025-09-13, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. That appears to be a tooling/environment issue rather than a user input issue. I can try again, but I don’t want to stall you if you’d like to move forward with a draft now.

Here are two paths we can take:

Option A — Retry data pull and deliver a full, data-driven report
- I’ll re-run the Reddit stock-info fetch (and, if possible, parallelly pull any other available social/news feeds you allow).
- I’ll then assemble a comprehensive long report detailing:
  - Daily and week-by-week sentiment trends on NFLX from Reddit and other sources (if available).
  - Key talking points driving sentiment (e.g., subscriber data, pricing changes, content strategy, platform initiatives).
  - A concise news snapshot from the past week (earnings, product updates, regulatory or competitive developments).
  - Implications for traders: potential catalysts, risk factors, and sentiment-driven trading cues (entry/exit points, options patterns, etc.).
- I’ll end with a Markdown table organizing the key points for easy reference.

Option B — Interim qualitative analysis (no data pull right now)
- If you’d prefer to proceed immediately, I can deliver a thorough qualitative framework and an outline for the final report, plus a ready-to-fill table. I’ll clearly note where data is pending and what I’ll fill in as soon as the data tool is functioning again.
- This keeps you moving while I resolve the data feed issue.

If you’d like me to retry now, say “Retry,” and I’ll attempt to fetch NFLX Reddit data for 2025-09-13 again and proceed with Option A. Otherwise, I can start with Option B and provide a detailed structure and placeholders you can review.

Draft structure I’ll deliver (once data is in):
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment stance, major sentiment drivers, and headline news highlights.
- Social sentiment analysis: daily sentiment deltas, notable spikes, top threads/themes, and affected subreddits.
- News synthesis: notable events in the past week and their potential impact on NFLX fundamentals and perception.
- Sentiment-to-price implications: how the mood translates into potential moves (short-term catalysts, risk factors, and scenario analysis).
- Trader-oriented takeaways: specific actionable ideas (entry/exit levels, options ideas, risk controls).
- Data notes: sources, time windows, and any caveats.

Proposed Markdown table (structure, to fill with actual data):
- A table with columns: Aspect, Time Window, Sentiment Direction, Key Signals, News Catalysts, Implications for Traders, Confidence.
- Rows could include: Overall Sentiment, Reddit Top Themes, Daily Change, Recent News Highlights, Subscriber/Content Signals, Competitive/Macro Context, Market-Implied Signals.

Please tell me which option you prefer (Retry or Option B). If you choose Retry, I’ll kick off the data pull immediately and proceed with the full report as soon as I have the data.
