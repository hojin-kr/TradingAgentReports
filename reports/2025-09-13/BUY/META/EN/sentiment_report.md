I tried to fetch META Reddit stock data for 2025-09-13 using the provided tool, but I’m hitting an internal tool error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data pull, or proceed with a qualitative, source-agnostic analysis in the meantime and fill in Reddit-specific signals once the tool is functioning again.

How would you like to proceed?
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then deliver a full, data-backed report (sentiment by day, top themes, and Reddit-driven insights).
- Option B: I proceed with a qualitative, multi-source analysis (public sentiment and recent news) using available methods, clearly marking where Reddit data would be integrated once the tool works again.
- Option C: A mix: I start with a structured framework and placeholders, then retry in a follow-up message.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option B (qualitative now), here is a ready-to-fill report framework I’ll complete once I have data, plus a Makrdown table at the end to organize key points. I’ll explicitly note where Reddit data would be inserted.

Proposed report framework (to be filled with data when available)
- Executive snapshot
  - Quick read on the current sentiment backdrop and news tone for META as of 2025-09-13.
  - Top-line implications for traders (short-term catalysts/risks).

- Data sources and methodology (summary)
  - Social sentiment: Reddit, X/Twitter, StockTwits, other forums (to be quantified once data is available).
  - News: recent company press releases, earnings-related coverage, regulatory updates, major product announcements.
  - Timeframe: past 7–10 days (as available).

- Daily sentiment scaffold (qualitative)
  - Day-by-day sentiment directional impulse (positive/neutral/negative) with brief note on drivers.
  - Key polarized themes driving swings (e.g., ad revenue trajectory, AI initiatives, privacy/regulatory risk, user growth on Threads, monetization updates).

- Top themes from social discussions
  - Product and platform: performance of Meta platforms, ads ecosystem, privacy changes, AI features.
  - Financial: revenue trends, profitability, guidance, capital allocation.
  - Regulation and macro: antitrust/regulatory scrutiny, data privacy, geopolitical considerations.

  - Medium-term considerations (6–12 weeks) tied to monetization, AI roadmap, and platform strategy.
  - Sentiment-driven vs. fundamentals-driven drivers.

- Risk factors and considerations
  - Regulatory exposure, ad market cyclicality, competition (e.g., short-video/social platforms), supply-side risks (AI costs, hardware for reality labs).

- Signals and potential trades framework
  - How sentiment and news might translate into price action.
  - Suggested risk-managed approaches (e.g., options strategies around catalysts, or hedge ideas).

- Stakeholder notes
  - What different market participants might be watching (growth-focused vs. value, risk-averse vs. risk-tolerant).

- Makrdown table: Key points at-a-glance
  - A structured table with rows for: Sentiment Trend, Primary Drivers, Recent News Signals, Market Implications, Risks, and Next Steps.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry the Reddit data pull now), I’ll reattempt the META Reddit data fetch for 2025-09-13 and then deliver the full, data-backed report with:

- Daily sentiment breakdown by day
- Top Reddit threads/themes
- The most impactful sentiment shifts and their potential market impact
- A concise synthesis for traders with clear risk/reward implications

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’re leaning toward a quick qualitative pass now, I’ll proceed with Option B and clearly flag where Reddit data will be added once the tool is available again.
