I attempted to fetch META data with get_YFin_data, but the data source returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like a backend data availability issue right now, so I can’t generate the actual indicator values or a live trend report at the moment. I can proceed in two ways:
- Wait for the data fetch to succeed and then produce a detailed, data-driven analysis with the 8 selected indicators.
- Or proceed with a structured plan and a qualitative framework using the chosen indicators, so you can review the approach while we resolve the data issue.

Here’s the plan I’ll execute as soon as the data retrieval works, along with the chosen indicator set and a detailed framework for META.

Selected indicators (8), chosen for complementary insights without significant redundancy
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for META (given a typical large-cap tech/advertising environment)
- 50 SMA and 200 SMA: These provide a clear view of the medium- and long-term trend regime. META often moves with broader tech/tad macro cycles, so having both helps distinguish secular trend direction (bullish/bearish) from shorter-term noise. A price trading above both could indicate a strong uptrend; sustained price action below them may signal a downtrend or consolidation.
- 10 EMA: A responsive short-term momentum gauge to catch quick shifts around the broader trend signaled by the SMAs. Useful for identifying potential entry/exit windows when the stock is transitioning.
- MACD, MACD Signal (macds), MACD Histogram (macdh): This trio provides a cohesive view of momentum and its momentum change, including crossovers (trend changes), convergence/divergence, and the strength of moves. They are particularly useful in volatile tech stocks where momentum can flip quickly.
- RSI: A momentum oscillator that helps flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals, with the caveat that strong trends can push RSI for extended periods. It’s valuable when used in conjunction with trend indicators (SMA/EMA) to avoid false reversals.
- ATR: A volatility gauge that informs risk management—position sizing and stop-placement should reflect current volatility. In META’s often dynamic environment (ad markets, product cycles, regulatory/macro news), ATR helps tailor risk to market conditions.

How I’ll interpret and use these indicators (framework you can reference once data is available)
- Trend direction and strength
  - Price position relative to close_50_sma and close_200_sma: bullish if price is above both and the SMAs are aligned (50 above 200). Bearish if price is below both with a bearish SMA alignment.
  - MACD crossovers and histogram (macd and macdh): bullish when MACD line crosses above the MACD Signal and histogram widens in the positive direction; bearish when the opposite occurs.
- Momentum timing
  - close_10_ema: crossovers of price with the 10 EMA can signal near-term momentum shifts; use in conjunction with the MACD signals to filter entries.
  - RSI: look for momentum confirmation around trend signals (e.g., RSI rising toward 60–70 with price breaking above a resistance level; watch for overbought readings near 70 in uptrends as a caution).
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR: use to adjust stop distances and position sizing. A rising ATR suggests wider stops, while a falling ATR implies tighter stop placement may be appropriate.
- Countercheck and confirmation
  - Use RSI in conjunction with MACD (e.g., MACD uptrend with RSI not yet overbought) to avoid buying into an overextended rally.
  - If price is above the 50/200 SMAs but RSI is overbought and MACD histogram is peaking, be cautious of a pullback; await a pullback and MACD confirmation before new entries.

Next steps (once data fetch is resolved)
- Run the 8 selected indicators on META for the desired date range.
- Generate a detailed trend report that includes:
  - Current trend regime (bullish/bearish/neutral) per SMA alignment.
  - Momentum signals from MACD lines and histogram, plus EMA crossovers.
  - Momentum strength and possible reversals from RSI.
  - Volatility context from ATR to adjust risk management.
- Provide a concise set of actionable signals (potential long/short entries, risk controls) and a brief rationale for each.

Appendix: key points table (ready to populate with live data)
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret (quick guide) | What to watch in META |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction | Price above = uptrend bias; price below = downtrend bias | Confirm trend with 200 SMA; look for crossovers |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend direction | Price above = long-term uptrend; price below = long-term downtrend | Use for regime filtering; watch for golden/death cross with other signals |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price/market action around 10 EMA signals quick shifts | Use with MACD for timely entries/exits |
| macd | Momentum trend changes | MACD line crossing MACD signal; positive/negative momentum | Look for crossovers, align with price breaks |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Cross of MACD with MACDS strengthens rejection/confirmation | Use to time entries when MACD also supports direction |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Histogram rising = strengthening momentum; falling = weakening momentum | Watch for divergences with price |
| rsi | Relative momentum | RSI > 70 overbought; RSI < 30 oversold; watch for divergences | Use with trend context to avoid premature exits/entries |
| atr | Volatility / risk context | Higher ATR means higher volatility; adjust stops/position size accordingly | Essential for risk management in volatile periods |

Important note: I can proceed with generating this analysis as soon as the data retrieval (get_YFin_data) is available again. If you’d like, I can also try an alternative approach (e.g., using a different data source or waiting for the backend to restore)—just tell me how you’d prefer to proceed.

Would you like me to retry data retrieval now or proceed with the qualitative plan and indicators as outlined above until the data tool becomes available again?
