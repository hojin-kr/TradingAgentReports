Recommendation: HOLD Palantir (PLTR)

Rationale
- The plan’s core assessment remains valid: the bull case (AI-enabled data platform, governance moat, government stability, commercial upside) is credible in parts, but near-term fundamentals raise meaningful questions (lumpy government bookings, uncertain commercial ramp, margin/cash-flow pressures, high valuation).
- The bear case is still material: reliance on government revenue cadence, potential delays in cross-sell, and EBITDA/FCF trajectory uncertainties argue for caution.
- Valuation remains premium for a story with unclear near-term path to durable profitability. Until ARR growth, gross margins, and free cash flow show credible, sustained improvement, the upside is potentially vulnerable to multiple compression on any hiccups.
- Data gaps and macro/AI-spend uncertainties amplify risk, supporting a disciplined Hold rather than a Buy today.

Risk controls and portfolio posture
- Limit exposure to a modest sleeve (e.g., 2–5% of equity capital) due to high beta and mixed signal reliability.
- Implement a structured risk framework: trailing stop on price moves and a hard drawdown stop (e.g., 15–20% from entry, adjustable for risk tolerance).
- Consider a modest hedge (put or collar) to protect downside while preserving optionality for upside.

Key signals to monitor (4–8 quarters)
- ARR growth by segment (government vs. commercial) and cross-sell velocity.
- Commercial deal cadence: pilots converting to multi-year contracts, CAC/VA trajectory, renewal rates, and gross margin progression on deployments.
- Margin trajectory: gross margin improvement, operating leverage, and any movement toward positive or expanding FCF.
- Backlog and visibility: contract duration mix, renewal probability, and revenue clarity.
- Dependency and risk signals: marquee customer concentration, contract delays, or renegotiations.
- Competitive/regulatory headlines affecting governance moat.

Catalysts and timing
- Earnings/guidance: treat misses skeptically; require visible improvement in commercial ARR growth and margin trajectory to justify higher exposure.
- Government/news cycle: favorable announcements can lift sentiment but should be corroborated by recurring revenue momentum.
- AI spend environment: sustained enterprise AI spend with clear ROI signals could justify a bigger emphasis on PLTR; reassess exposure if such signals strengthen.

What would trigger a shift toward Buy or Sell
- Move toward Buy: sustained, credible ARR acceleration in commercial segments, meaningful gross margin improvement, and a clear free cash flow path within 4–8 quarters, with reacceleration in government bookings not just episodic.
- Move toward Sell: persistent ARR stagnation, worsening margins/FCF, or renewed volatility/downgrade risk from regulatory/government exposure or competitive encroachment without evidence of offsetting progress.

Bottom line
- Hold with disciplined risk controls and a clear re-evaluation plan. If fundamentals prove durable and provide credible margin and FCF improvement alongside ARR expansion, consider increasing exposure toward Buy. If bear risks intensify or data signals weaken, be prepared to trim further or pivot to Sell if justified by deteriorating fundamentals.
