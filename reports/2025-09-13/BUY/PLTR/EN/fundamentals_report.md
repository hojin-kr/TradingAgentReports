I’m running into an internal error pulling the data right now (FileNotFoundError from the data tools). I can’t fetch the SimFin income statement/balance sheet/cash flow or the Finnhub insider sentiment/transactions at the moment. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

Options for moving forward
- Retry now: I can attempt to fetch all data again in a moment and then generate the full, data-backed fundamental report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Hybrid approach: I can provide a detailed qualitative framework and analysis for PLTR based on general fundamentals and publicly known context up to 2024/2025, and then fill in the precise figures as soon as the data tools are available.
- Alternative data source: If you have access to another data feed you’d like me to use (or you want me to pull from a public source you specify), I can incorporate that.

What I will deliver once data is available
- Company profile and business model overview (PLTR’s main revenue streams, customers, and go-to-market).
- Financial snapshots (quarterly, where available) from:
  - Income statement: revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS, margins, key expense lines.
  - Balance sheet: cash and equivalents, debt, equity, liquidity ratios, working capital position.
  - Cash flow: operating cash flow, investing activities, financing activities, free cash flow.
- Financial history and trend analysis:
  - Revenue growth trajectory by segment (government vs commercial if disclosed), gross margin evolution, operating leverage, R&D and SG&A trends.
  - Profitability dynamics (GAAP vs non-GAAP if applicable), expense structure, and cash generation quality.
- Insider data (past 15-day window as requested):
  - Insider sentiment snapshot and notable insider transactions (net buying/selling, frequent participants, size of trades).
- Risk assessment and potential catalysts:
  - Key risks (customer concentration, government exposure, competitive landscape, operating cash burn vs FCF, stock-based compensation impact).
  - Potential catalysts (commercial adoption ramp, software platform expansions, AI/ML productization, government contract milestones).
- Quick-reference table (Markdown) summarizing:
  - Key metrics (revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, cash & equivalents, debt, FCF), recent trend, and notable insider activity.

Would you like me to retry the data retrieval now, or proceed with a qualitative PLTR fundamentals write-up (with the intention to insert precise figures as soon as the data tools succeed)? If you prefer the qualitative route, I can start right away and clearly mark where numerical data will be inserted once available.
