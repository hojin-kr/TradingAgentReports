I attempted to fetch PLTR data and run the indicator analyses, but the data retrieval backend returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I don’t have live numbers to generate the trend report right now. I can retry the data fetch immediately if you’d like, or try a shorter date window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to get a quick snapshot. In the meantime, here is a robust, complementary indicator setup I would use for PLTR and why, plus how I’d interpret signals once the data is available.

Selected indicators (8, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Rationale for PLTR context
- Moving Averages (close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema)
  - 50 SMA provides a mid-term trend perspective and acts as dynamic support/resistance.
  - 200 SMA anchors the long-term trend and helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death-style cross concepts).
  - 10 EMA gives a responsive read on near-term momentum, useful for early entries in a volatile stock like PLTR.
  - Together, these three offer a layered view of trend, with the 10 EMA giving fast cues and the 50/200 SMAs confirming longer-term direction.

- MACD family (macd, macds, macdh)
  - macd (MACD line) signals momentum direction and crossovers.
  - macds (MACD Signal) provides smoother crossovers to filter noise.
  - macdh (MACD Histogram) shows momentum strength and potential divergences.
  - Using all three helps confirm momentum shifts and reduces false entries in choppy markets.

- RSI (rsi)
  - Measures momentum acceleration and potential overbought/oversold regions.
  - In PLTR’s context, RSI can help identify exhaustion in run-ups or bottoming conditions, especially when looked at in conjunction with trend/wave signals from MA and MACD.

- ATR (atr)
  - Captures current volatility level, informing position sizing and stop placement.
  - PLTR has shown periods of sizeable volatility; ATR helps tailor risk management to recent price dynamics.

How signals would be interpreted (when data is available)
- Trend confirmation
  - Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA generally supports an uptrend narrative; a sustained move above 50 SMA with 200 SMA also trending higher strengthens the bullish context.
  - A cross of price above 10 EMA in conjunction with MACD bullish signals (MACD line above MACD Signal, positive MACD Histogram) reinforces momentum.

- Momentum checks
  - MACD crossovers (macd crossing above macds) validate upward momentum; bearish crossovers reinforce caution if other signals align.
  - RSI rising toward the 70 level can indicate strong upside momentum but watch for overbought conditions; a divergence between RSI and price (e.g., price making new highs while RSI fails to) could foreshadow a pullback.

- Volatility and risk controls
  - ATR rising signals expanding volatility; consider widening stops or reducing position size accordingly.
  - If ATR compresses and price tightens near a key MA, look for a breakout/pullback setup with confluence from MACD and RSI.

- Combined interpretation example (conceptual, no numbers)
  - Scenario A (bullish setup): Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA, price above 10 EMA, MACD line above MACD Signal with positive MACD Histogram, RSI trending up but not overbought, ATR increasing modestly. Interpretation: Favor long entry on a pullback toward the 10 EMA or 50 SMA with a stop below the recent swing low; target could be governed by prior resistance and/or a test of the 200 SMA.
  - Scenario B (caution): Price tests the 50 SMA from above while MACD shows weakening momentum (MACD Histogram shrinking, MACD line approaching MACD Signal) and RSI fails to advance or shows divergence. Interpretation: Consider reducing size or waiting for a clearer bullish confirmation before entering.
  - Scenario C (risk-off/volatility spike): ATR spikes while price breaks below 50 SMA and MACD turns negative; RSI rolls over from overbought. Interpretation: Potential exit or hedging; avoid new long entries until a fresh bullish setup appears.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now to produce a fully fleshed trend report with the 8 indicators above, followed by a concise narrative of the current trend, momentum, volatility, and risk signals for PLTR.
- If you prefer, I can adjust the window (e.g., last 6 months, last 1 year) or switch to a different ticker/date range.

Proposed quick-action plan if data comes back healthy
- Run the 8 selected indicators for PLTR.
- Generate a detailed trend narrative (trend direction, momentum, volatility, and risk signals).
- Append a Markdown table summarizing key takeaways and suggested actions.

Markdown table: Key indicators and interpretation (planned)
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for PLTR | Suggested actions (trading context) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above indicates uptrend; price below suggests weakness | Look for pullbacks to 50 SMA as potential entry in uptrends; use as support for stop placement |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above confirms long-term uptrend; below signals bearish regime | Use for strategic trend confirmation; golden/death-like cross cues as longer-term signals |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above/near 10 EMA indicates near-term bullish momentum; cross below signals momentum fade | Use for early entries or trimming if price crosses below with weak volume |
| macd | Momentum direction | MACD line vs MACD Signal cross indicates momentum shifts; positive histogram supports up moves | Look for bullish cross with price above key SMAs; confirm with RSI and ATR |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Smoother confirmation of momentum changes | Use with macd for cross-based entries/exits to reduce false signals |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength; divergences can foreshadow reversals | Watch for growing histogram in uptrends; negative divergences warn of potential pullbacks |
| rsi | Momentum strength / overbought-oversold | Rising RSI supports uptrend; overbought readings require caution; divergences matter | Use with trend; avoid overreliance when in strong uptrends; look for reversals with RSI divergence |
| atr | Volatility level | Higher ATR means higher volatility and wider price swings; helps sizing/stop placement | Adjust position sizing and stops; use ATR-based stops to align with current volatility |

If you want me to proceed, tell me to retry data retrieval now and I’ll run the indicators again and deliver the full, data-backed trend report with the requested table. If you’d prefer a different ticker or date window in the meantime, I can adapt.
