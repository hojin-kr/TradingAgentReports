# Fundamentals Report

I’m ready to continue, but I still need a few clarifications to fetch the exact data you want. If you’d like, I can also proceed with sensible defaults to move quickly.

Please confirm (or feel free to accept defaults I propose below):

- Period (date window)
  - Confirm: July 1, 2025 through August 28, 2025 (inclusive), or specify a different start/end date.

- Source platform
  - Confirm: Fundamentally “Fundamental” platform/site (the one you referenced), or provide a URL if you have a different source in mind.

- Output format and level of detail
  - Per-post table: one row per post with fields such as:
    - post date, post title, author (optional), short excerpt
    - fundamental metrics as of the post date: P/E, P/S, P/B, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, Revenue, Net Income, EV/EBITDA, possibly Market Cap and Debt/Equity
  - Aggregated summary: one row per day or per week (or a single period summary) with the latest post’s metrics in that window or averaged metrics if you prefer
  - Output: readable table in chat and a downloadable CSV/Excel (if you want)

- Metrics to include (please select)
  - Core set (default I propose): P/E (forward if available, else TTM), P/S, P/B, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, Revenue, Net Income, EV/EBITDA, Market Cap, Debt/Equity
  - If a metric isn’t present on a post, mark as N/A
  - Optional additions (you can add): FCF per Share, P/CF, Net Margin, EBITDA

- Post handling
  - Include all posts in the window, or limit to the first N posts (e.g., first 50 posts) to avoid overload?
  - Duplicate/reposts: include unique posts only (ignore exact duplicates posted multiple times)

- Output deliverables
  - I’ll return a table in chat (readable) plus a Markdown-ready table at the end, with sources/citations per post
  - If you want, I can also return a CSV/Excel file download

If you’d like me to proceed without waiting for clarifications, I’ll use these defaults:
- Period: 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-28
- Source: Fundamental platform (as-is)
- Per-post: date, title, excerpt, metrics (P/E, P/S, P/B, OCF, FCF, Revenue, Net Income, EV/EBITDA)
- Aggregation: per-post table (one row per post)
- Post limit: first 50 posts
- Metrics: core set listed above, N/A where unavailable
- Output: chat table + downloadable CSV

Please confirm which path you’d like, or tell me your exact preferences.
