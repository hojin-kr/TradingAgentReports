# Fundamentals Report

Sorry about that — I attempted to fetch AMZN fundamentals, but the tool returned an internal error (AttributeError related to the web search response). I can try again, or we can proceed with a structured manual overview now and fill in the specifics once the data fetch works.

How would you like to proceed?
- Option 1: Retry fetching AMZN fundamentals now. I’ll run the data pull again and deliver a comprehensive, trader-focused report with a Markdown table of key points at the end.
- Option 2: I provide a detailed, best-effort fundamentals framework for AMZN based on the latest publicly available information I can synthesize without the live data pull (note: this will not be fully up-to-date with the past week unless you approve another fetch).

If you prefer, I can also outline the exact sections I’ll cover (company profile, financials, history, liquidity, segment performance, earnings, capital allocation, insider sentiment/transactions, catalysts, and risks) and then fill them in once the data pull succeeds.
