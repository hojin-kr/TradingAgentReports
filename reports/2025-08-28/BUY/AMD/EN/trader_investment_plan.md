# Trader Investment Plan

Assessment:
- The provided plan for AMD emphasizes a breakout-driven buy: a reclaim of the 10-day EMA with positive momentum signals (MACD turning toward MACD_Signal and RSI above ~55), followed by a measured entry and tight risk controls. This aligns with a durable, multi-year AI/data-center tailwind, while acknowledging near-term momentum risks and macro/competitive pressures.
- The breakout-confirmation requirement is prudent to avoid chases on weaker momentum days. The suggested stops around the 50SMA (~158) or lower Bollinger Band help cap downside if momentum fades.

Decision:
- Proceed with a disciplined Buy-on-Confirmation strategy. Initiate a starter position only on a clear daily close above the 10 EMA with MACD moving toward a cross and RSI > 55. If price fails to confirm on a close above the trigger, stay on the sidelines or wait for a more convincing setup.

Execution plan (as a concise recap):
- Entry trigger: Daily close above the 10 EMA (roughly 168.3 today) with MACD turning toward MACD_Signal and RSI > 55. If intraday breach occurs but fails to close above, wait for daily close confirmation.
- Position sizing: Start with 1.5–2.5% of the portfolio, with a plan to add on confirmed breakout. Total AMD exposure kept within your normal risk budget (2–4% of portfolio max for this name, depending on risk tolerance).
- Stop loss: Place hard stop just below the 50SMA (~158) or below the lower Bollinger Band, whichever is more conservative in your chart read.
- Scaling in: If the initial trigger confirms, add on a move above the first major resistance (around 171) or on a pullback that holds above 168–169 with MACD turning decisively positive.
- Targets and exits:
  - Target 1: ~171 (Bollinger middle). Move stop to breakeven or minimal profit cushion at/near this level.
  - Target 2: ~180–190 if momentum remains positive and MACD stays supportive.
  - If momentum fails (close back below 10 EMA after breakout, or MACD loses footing for an extended period), reduce exposure or exit.
- Time horizon: 2–6 weeks for breakout expression; monitor AI-cycle news, data-center revenue signals, and margin commentary as supplementary proof points.
- Risk controls after entry: Use a trailing stop beyond initial targets to protect upside; reassess quickly if macro risk worsens or AMD guidance softens.

Lessons applied:
- Avoid chasing headlines; rely on confirmed breakout signals.
- Confirm trend across indicators and timeframes before scaling in.
- Define precise stops and keep risk within a disciplined budget.
- Use a staged entry to balance risk and reward, not an all-in move on a single moment.
- Keep a diversified approach and monitor data-center ASP/margins and competitive dynamics.

Final stance:
- Buy on breakout confirmation with tight risk controls as outlined above.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
