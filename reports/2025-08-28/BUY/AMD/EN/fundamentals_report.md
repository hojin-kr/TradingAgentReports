# Fundamentals Report

I hit an internal error fetching the AMD fundamentals data for the requested window. I can retry the fetch now, or we can switch to a fallback approach. Here are two clear options:

Option A — Retry with defaults (fastest path if you want to proceed now)
- Platform: Fundamentals (assumed default platform; please specify if you have a preferred URL)
- Date range: July 1, 2025 to August 28, 2025 (inclusive)
- Frequency: End-of-month snapshots (two rows: 2025-07-31 and 2025-08-28)
- Metrics: Trailing P/E, Trailing P/S, Price/Book (if available), Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, Revenue, Net Income, ROE, Debt/Equity, Market Cap
- Output: Markdown table in chat (one row per date with a possible summary row)

Option B — Fallback approach (no date-bound fetch, but still useful for traders)
- Use the latest publicly reported fundamentals up to 2025-08 (TTM where applicable)
- Provide a single, consolidated view with commonly used metrics (TTM P/E, P/S, P/B, Revenue, Net Income, OCF, FCF, ROE, Debt/Equity, EV/EBITDA, Market Cap)
- Output: Markdown table plus a short interpretation

What I need from you to proceed:
- Do you want me to retry immediately (Option A)? If yes, I’ll attempt the two-date fetch again (2025-07-31 and 2025-08-28) and return a table with the requested metrics.
- Or would you prefer Option B (latest available fundamentals, not strictly bound to those two dates) or a different set of metrics?

If you have a specific platform URL for “Fundamental” (or a different data source you want me to use), please share it and I’ll use that instead.
