# Sentiment Report

Thanks for the nudge. Quick status update and plan:

What happened
- I attempted to pull META stock-news data for the past week via the stock-news tool, but I’m hitting an internal error: AttributeError: "'ResponseFunctionWebSearch' object has no attribute 'content'". That means the current stock-news retrieval endpoint is temporarily not returning usable data.

What I can do right now
- I can still prepare a comprehensive, trader-focused long report describing META’s latest sentiment and news themes once we can fetch data again. In the meantime, I’ll outline exactly what I’ll deliver and provide a ready-to-fill structure so we can drop in the data as soon as the tool is back.

What I propose to do next (once the tool is functioning again)
- Pull daily social sentiment signals and notable headlines for META from 2025-08-22 to 2025-08-28 (or your preferred window) across major platforms (X/Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, LinkedIn).
- Synthesize sentiment trajectories, identify the main drivers (earnings context, product/news items, regulatory or competitive news), and map them to potential trading implications.
- Provide a granular, day-by-day breakdown with platform sources, post excerpts (where available), and links.
- Deliver a detailed implications section tailored for traders (volatility drivers, observed sentiment vs. price action, catalysts, risk factors).
- Include a concise risk/uncertainty section and 1–2 concrete trading ideas (long/short ideas or hedges) if sentiment aligns with actionable signals.

What you can approve now (to speed things once the tool is back)
- Default scope (recommended): 
  - Platforms: X/Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, LinkedIn
  - Terms: mentions of "META" or "Meta" (case-insensitive), including official Meta accounts and mentions of Meta Platforms, Inc. as a brand
  - Language: all languages (with English-dominant summaries)
  - Window: 2025-08-22 to 2025-08-28 (inclusive)
  - Output: a structured digest with platform, author, date, excerpt, and source link; plus a daily sentiment score and a final synthesis
  - Volume: top 100–150 posts (or all if you’d prefer; I’ll default to a balanced cap)
- If you’d like a different scope (e.g., exclude official Meta accounts, limit to English, or a tighter window), tell me and I’ll adapt.

In the meantime, I’ll prepare a thorough report skeleton you can review and approve so we can drop in the data as soon as the tool is fixed.

Draft report structure (what you’ll get)
- Executive Summary
- Daily Sentiment Overview (Aug 22–28)
  - Net sentiment score per day
  - Top platforms driving sentiment
  - Notable themes driving sentiment each day (AI, ads, privacy, VR/AR, monetization, Threads adoption, etc.)
- Notable Posts & Signals
  - 6–12 representative posts (platform, author, date, snippet, link)
  - Brief qualitative take on why each post matters for sentiment and potential price impact
- News Headlines Recap (from the stock-news feed once available)
  - Key headlines by day
  - Market interpretation notes (contrast with sentiment)
- Platform-Specific Signals
  - X/Twitter, Reddit, Facebook/Instagram, Threads, LinkedIn
  - Snapshot of sentiment distribution and any platform-specific themes
- Implications for Traders
  - Likelihood of near-term volatility
  - Potential catalysts and timing signals
  - Risk considerations (regulatory, competitive, privacy)
- Trading Ideas (if applicable)
  - Short-term view (1–2 weeks)
  - Longer-term view (if sentiment suggests a structural shift)
- Risks and Limitations
  - Data gaps, noise vs. signal, potential biases
- Appendices
  - Full list of sources with dates and links
- Makrdown table (key points recap)

Makrdown table (ready to fill with data)
- You’ll see a compact table at the end of the final report with columns like:
  - Date, Platform, Source/Author, Snippet, Sentiment (Pos/Neg/Neutral), Key Theme, Potential Impact
  - This helps traders quickly scan the core signals

Next steps
- Please confirm you’re okay with the default scope (all platforms, META/META mentions, all languages, 2025-08-22 to 2025-08-28) or tell me your preferred adjustments.
- I’ll rerun the data pull as soon as the stock-news tool issue is resolved and deliver the full, structured long report with the Makrmarkdown table appended.

If you want me to proceed immediately with a best-guess qualitative synthesis (without live data) in the meantime, I can provide a provisional narrative focused on likely themes around META in late August 2025 (AI strategy, ad market dynamics, Threads momentum, and VR/AR push) with clearly labeled caveats. Would you like me to do that?
