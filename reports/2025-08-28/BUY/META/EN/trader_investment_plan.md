# Trader Investment Plan

Recommendation: Buy META, but only through a disciplined, momentum-confirmed, staged entry with strict risk controls.

Rationale
- Bull case alignment: META shows a durable uptrend potential and AI-driven monetization optionality that can support higher long-run returns.
- Bear risks acknowledged: near-term momentum may be weak and macro/regulatory factors could cap a quick move, so entry should be conditional on momentum signals, not chase-driven.

Entry and risk framework (summary)
- Two-path entry:
  - Conservative path (preferred): Enter on a daily close above 10 EMA (~754) with price above 50SMA, MACD crossing above signal, histogram turning positive, and RSI rising toward the mid-60s.
  - Secondary path: Start a smaller starter near 50SMA (~734) if momentum stabilizes (MACD near zero, histogram flat to positive, RSI turning up); add on confirmation.
- Price levels to watch: 50SMA around 734; 10 EMA around 754; current price ~747.
- Risk controls:
  - Risk per trade: 0.5%–1.0% of total capital.
  - Stop: ATR-based, roughly 1.5x ATR below the most recent swing low; with ATR ~16.8, target about 25 points below the swing low (adjust to exact swing low).
  - Position sizing: scale size with confirmations; smaller initial size on the conservative path, larger on additional confirmations.
- Initial targets:
  - Short-term: 764–770 after momentum re-acceleration.
  - If momentum persists: 780–800 as an intermediate to long target.

Monitoring and exit rules
- Confirmations to keep positions:
  - MACD stays above zero with histogram positive; RSI trending 60–65; price remains above 50SMA.
- Exit signals:
  - If MACD fails to hold above zero or histogram turns negative and RSI falters, trim or exit.
  - If price breaks below 50SMA (734) with weak momentum, reduce exposure quickly.
  - If momentum reverses (MACD crosses below, histogram negative, RSI drops toward 50–55), reassess and potentially exit.
- Review cadence: daily momentum checks around levels (MACD, histogram, RSI) and a weekly macro/regulatory context assessment.

Bottom line
- The strong, longer-term bull case supports a Buy, but only with a disciplined, momentum-confirmed, staged entry and robust risk controls. Do not chase current momentum; wait for the confirmatory signals and deploy in increments as conditions validate.
