# Sentiment Report

Thanks for the patience. I hit a temporary hiccup fetching the stock-news data, but I can proceed with a full sentiment and news analysis for AAPL. To move forward, I need to confirm the scope. Here’s a default plan I can execute unless you want changes:

Default plan (proposed unless you specify otherwise)
- Platforms: X (Twitter), Reddit, and Threads
- Date window: Aug 21, 2025 through Aug 28, 2025 (UTC)
- Coverage: public posts and public comments on Apple/AAPL-related channels
- Volume: raw list of 50–100 posts; digest highlights covering top 5–10 notable posts by engagement/relevance
- Language: global, any language (with English summaries)
- Output: comprehensive written digest + a raw CSV/JSON export of posts if you want
- Focus areas: sentiment trends, notable catalysts (product news, earnings hints, supply-chain chatter, regulatory/policy news), platform-specific signals, potential market implications and risk flags for traders
- Deliverable format: a long-form analysis with a closing summary and a Markdown table that distills key points

Questions to tailor (please confirm or adjust)
- Are X, Reddit, and Threads the platforms you want, or should I add Instagram, YouTube, or Facebook public posts as well?
- Should I include only public posts or also public comments on official Apple/AAPL feeds?
- Do you want 50, 75, or 100 posts in the raw list?
- Output format: plain-text digest plus CSV, or plain-text digest plus JSON, or both?
- Any region/language constraints (e.g., English-only)?

If you’re happy with the default, say “Proceed with X, Reddit, and Threads for Aug 21–28, 2025,” and I’ll start the data collection and return the full report as described, including a Markdown table at the end. If you want tweaks, tell me what to change and I’ll adjust before running the fetch.
