# Trader Investment Plan

Decision: Hold PLTR for now.

Rationale (concise)
- Near-term dynamics: momentum appears pausing and volatility elevated, as suggested by MACD/momentum readings and higher ATR. This argues against adding meaningful new long exposure today.
- Longer-term thesis intact: government demand plus commercial expansion, platform moat (Ontology), and improving profitability still support upside if catalysts fire.
- Data caveats: some mixed price/indicator signals and insider activity warrant caution; holding preserves optionality without overcommitting.

Actionable plan for current position
- If you are already long: trim to reduce near-term risk while maintaining a core position to participate in potential re-acceleration.
- If you are flat or lightly exposed: wait for a clearer confirmatory signal before building a new long position.
- Risk controls:
  - Use ATR-based stops: ~1.5x–2x the current ATR from entry or the most recent swing low.
  - Position sizing: keep added exposure small until momentum proves itself.
- Confirmatory signal for potential upside (entry trigger only if observed):
  - Price reclaiming VWMA around 163 with volume above baseline.
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal and RSI rising above 50.
  - If triggered, scale in with a tight stop below the most recent swing low or a robust ATR-based level; target at least a 2:1 reward-to-risk, aiming toward recent highs or VWMA/50SMA confluence.
- Risk management if momentum deteriorates: a break below key support near the 50SMA (~155) or a nearby swing low should trigger an exit to preserve capital.
- Optional hedging: for larger exposure, consider a small protective put or put-spread to cap downside while waiting for momentum reassertion.

Catalysts and monitoring
- Track enterprise ARR growth, cross-sell momentum, and any new government awards/contract updates.
- Monitor AI sentiment and macro risk signals (rates/liquidity) as they influence multiple expansion.
- Be mindful of data integrity between OHLC data and moving averages; prioritize price-action confirmation and volume.

Format options
- I can deliver a concise one-page briefing or a deeper, scenario-driven playbook with explicit numeric levels and probabilistic outcomes. If you’d like, specify your preferred format and I’ll produce it.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
