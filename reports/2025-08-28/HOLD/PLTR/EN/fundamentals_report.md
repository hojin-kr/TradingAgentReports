# Fundamentals Report

I hit a tool error pulling PLTR fundamentals right now. The get_fundamentals_openai call returned an AttributeError (a backend/web-search wrapper issue: "'ResponseFunctionWebSearch' object has no attribute 'content'"). I’ve tried a couple of times, and the issue persists.

What would you like me to do next? Here are your options:

- Option A: Retry and wait for the tool to be fixed. I can keep attempting to fetch the latest fundamentals for PLTR (date you specify) and then deliver the full report with the requested Markdown table.
- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort qualitative fundamentals snapshot now. I’ll provide a thorough outline of Palantir’s business, typical fundamental metrics (conceptual, not numbers), and a structured report format. I’ll clearly mark data as N/A or caveat where we don’t have exact figures, and I’ll include a ready-to-fill Markdown table you can update once numbers are available.
- Option C: Switch to a manual data-gathering approach. If you have preferred sources (e.g., Palantir’s 10-K/10-Q, earnings decks, official press releases), I can compile the report based on those sources and present a structured summary with citations you provide.

If you want the quickest path right now, I can start with Option B: a comprehensive qualitative fundamentals snapshot for PLTR, plus a Markdown table structure at the end with placeholders. Let me know which option you prefer, and if you choose A or B, specify the date window you want me to cover (e.g., latest week or specific dates).
