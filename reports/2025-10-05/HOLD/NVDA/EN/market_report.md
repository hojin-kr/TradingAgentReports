Status: data retrieval issues encountered
- I attempted to fetch NVDA price data and the various indicator reports, but the data access layer returned FileNotFoundError errors for the get_YFin_data calls (both in parallel and single retries).
- At the moment, I don’t have reliable numeric price data to compute and cite precise indicator values or trend readings for NVDA.

Despite the data access hiccup, I can still lay out a solid, practical framework and a carefully chosen set of indicators tailored to NVDA’s typical market behavior (high beta tech name with sizable volatility). I’ll also specify exactly which indicators I’d pull and why, so once the data fetch works, I can generate a detailed, numbers-backed report immediately.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, complementary, non-redundant)
1) close_50_sma
- Purpose: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance.
- Why NVDA: Helps filter trades in a high-volatility stock by confirming the broader trend before taking entries.
- Reading cue: Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend bias; price below suggests downtrend/bearish bias; cross of price above/below 50SMA can be a signal of trend change.

2) close_200_sma
- Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation.
- Why NVDA: NVDA often puts strong longer-term directional bias; 200SMA cross with price provides a macro-context signal (golden/death cross analogs, though not a direct cross here).
- Reading cue: Price above 200SMA supports a bullish framework; price below supports a bearish framework.

3) close_10_ema
- Purpose: Reactive short-term momentum. Quick shifts in price dynamics.
- Why NVDA: In a high-volatility stock, the 10 EMA helps catch early momentum shifts that can precede short-lived pullbacks or breakouts.
- Reading cue: Price interactions with the 10 EMA (crosses, or sustained moves above/below) flag momentum changes.

4) macd
- Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line relative to signal.
- Why NVDA: Combines with price action to validate changes in momentum; useful in spotting trend shifts when volatility is elevated.
- Reading cue: MACD line crossing above/below the signal line, or MACD histogram behavior, can signal trend changes.

5) macds
- Purpose: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD); crossovers with MACD trigger signals.
- Why NVDA: Crossovers provide more robust confirmation when combined with price action and other momentum tools.
- Reading cue: MACDS crossing MACD (or price-confirm)) can serve as entry/exit confirmation.

6) macdh
- Purpose: MACD histogram; momentum strength visualization.
- Why NVDA: Divergence/diminishing histogram can warn of weakening momentum even as price trends persist, or confirm accelerating momentum.
- Reading cue: Histogram expansion signals strengthening momentum; histogram contraction or negative values suggest waning momentum.

7) rsi
- Purpose: Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold and potential reversals/divergences.
- Why NVDA: Helps gauge extreme momentum in a high-volatility stock, and potential reversal points when used with trend context.
- Reading cue: RSI above ~70 indicates overbought risk; RSI below ~30 indicates oversold risk; watch for divergences with price.

8) atr
- Purpose: Volatility measure for risk management and position sizing.
- Why NVDA: In volatile names, ATR helps scale stops and assess stop distance; increases in ATR can widen stop legs during higher volatility regimes.
- Reading cue: Rising ATR suggests rising volatility (consider wider stops); falling ATR suggests calmer periods (can tighten risk controls).

What I can provide once data is available
- A detailed narrative: current price action, trend assessment with the 50SMA/200SMA, momentum signals from the 10 EMA and MACD family, RSI positioning, and volatility context from ATR.
- Concrete trade signals: entry thresholds, stop placement using ATR, target frameworks, and risk checks.
- A synthesis of potential scenarios (e.g., trend continuation vs. reversal) with color-coded confidence levels.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval as soon as you’d like. If you prefer, I can try a different date window (e.g., last 180 days up to today) or a shorter range to reduce data load, which sometimes helps in environments with tool access issues.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with a qualitative, numbers-skeleton analysis using the described indicators and your preferred assumptions, then plug in actual numbers once data is successfully fetched.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry data fetch now.
- Retry with a shorter/alternative date range.
- Proceed with a qualitative framework (and I’ll populate with actual numbers as soon as data is available).

Appendix: Key indicators table (selected 8 indicators)

- Close_200_sma: long-term trend confirmation
- Close_10_ema: short-term momentum capture
- MACD: momentum/trend-change signal
- MACDS: MACD signal line for cross-confirmation
- MACDH: momentum strength via histogram
- RSI: overbought/oversold and momentum divergences
- ATR: volatility and risk management (stop placement)

Markdown table: Summary of indicator roles
| Indicator | Role | Reading Cues in NVDA Context | Trade Implications |
|----------|------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| close_50_sma | Trend direction / dynamic support | Price above/below 50SMA; cross signals trend shift | Uptrend bias with pullbacks as potential entries; or downtrend confirmation if price stays below |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above/below 200SMA; proximity to 200SMA as support/resistance | Confirms macro trend; helps filter entries in high-volatility moves |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price interaction with 10EMA; crossovers indicate momentum shifts | Early entries or exits aligned with momentum changes; caution in choppy markets |
| macd | Momentum / trend change | MACD line vs signal; histogram direction | Signal trend changes; use with price action for robust entries |
| macds | MACD signal line | Cross of MACDS with MACD; filter cross signals | Additional confirmation for entries/exits |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction | Divergences or momentum accelerations guide risk adjustments |
| rsi | Momentum / overbought-oversold | RSI level (e.g., cross 70/30) and divergences | Overbought/oversold cues; divergences can precede reversals |
| atr | Volatility / risk management | Rising/falling volatility; stop-distance sizing | Use to set stops and adapt position sizing to current volatility |

If you want, I can attempt the data fetch again now and then deliver a full, numbers-backed NVDA report in one go. Just confirm how you’d like to proceed.
