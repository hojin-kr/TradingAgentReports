Recommendation: Hold NVDA for now.

Rationale
- The bull case remains intact over the long run, but near-term risks are material: valuations in a higher-rate, macro-sensitive environment, potential AI capex cycle deceleration, regulatory/export pressures, and competitive dynamics that could pressure margins.
- The bear case outlines plausible downside catalysts that could trigger multiple compression or growth deceleration in the quarters ahead. Given these, a disciplined, risk-managed stance is prudent.
- Your plan’s framework (risk controls, hedging, and staged exposure) provides a solid structure to participate in the secular AI theme while limiting downside.

Actionable guidance aligned with the plan
- Positioning
  - If overweight: trim toward a core, more modest weight. Preserve optionality with a smaller sleeve to participate on upside.
  - If flat/underweight: maintain core exposure but avoid aggressive adds; emphasize hedging rather than leverage.
- Risk management
  - Implement a protective hedge (e.g., 6–12 month puts near the money) to cap downside.
  - Consider a collar to finance downside protection with limited upside potential.
  - Size position based on risk budget and current volatility; avoid outsized exposure to one name.
- Entry/exit triggers (reclassification to Buy)
  - Buy trigger: sustained data-center revenue growth with improving margin trajectory and consistent positive quarterly beats; price action confirms a durable uptrend (holding above rising 50/200-day moving averages with positive momentum over 4–8 weeks).
  - Sell/trim trigger: meaningful deceleration in data-center growth YoY, margin compression in core segments, or macro/regulatory shocks amplifying downside risk; break below key technical levels on higher volume.
- Monitoring cadence
  - Quarterly reviews focused on data-center by segment, CUDA/software monetization, gross/operating margins, and free cash flow.
  - Watch macro signals: rate expectations, regulatory developments, and supply-chain dynamics.
- Diversification
  - Maintain exposure to AI tailwinds via diversified AI plays (ETFs or related names) to reduce single-name risk while staying aligned with the AI infrastructure theme.

Final note
- If data flow confirms continued outperformance and catalysts materialize, be prepared to reclassify to Buy with a clear move above key trend lines and rolling confirmations. If downside triggers hit, act promptly per the defined sell/trim rules to protect capital.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
