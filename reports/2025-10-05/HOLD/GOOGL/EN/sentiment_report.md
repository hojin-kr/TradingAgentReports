Sorry—I ran into an issue pulling the Reddit stock info for GOOGL today. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, which means I can’t fetch the latest social-media sentiment data at the moment. I can retry in a bit, but in the meantime I can still move the analysis forward in two ways:

What I can do right now
- Provide a detailed, ready-to-fill analysis framework for the report (so we can plug in the data as soon as the tool works again).
- Outline the expected sections, data points, and trader-oriented implications, so you have a clear path for interpretation once the data is available.

What I propose for the report structure (to fill in once data is back)
- Executive snapshot (1–2 paragraphs)
  - Current sentiment direction (positive/neutral/negative) and any standout themes
  - Key risk and catalyst notes for the next 1–2 weeks

- Social sentiment analysis (past 7 days)
  - Daily sentiment trend (positive/neutral/negative) with approximate scale
  - Top contributing posts or themes (e.g., AI announcements, earnings noise, regulatory/regulatory-oversight chatter, adbusiness updates)
  - Influencers or accounts driving the most engagement
  - Topic clusters (e.g., AI/Google Cloud/YouTube/Android, regulatory concerns, stock-specific questions)

- News and headlines (past 7 days)
  - Brief synthesis of major Alphabet/GOOGL news: earnings, product launches, partnerships, regulatory actions, antitrust/competition coverage
  - Signal vs noise: how the news interacts with social sentiment

- Price/sentiment correlation (if price data is available)
  - Any notable inflection points where sentiment moved ahead of price or vice versa
  - Look-for signals: sentiment spikes with rising/falling price, divergence patterns

- Trader insights and implications
  - Short-term scenarios (next 1–2 weeks): catalysts, risks, and potential trading biases
  - Medium-term considerations: how sentiment trajectory could influence earnings guidance, product cycles, or regulatory risk
  - Risk factors to monitor (regulatory changes, antitrust updates, ad market dynamics, AI competition)

- Quick-reference snippets for decision-making
  - If sentiment improves materially with positive news, potential buy-side catalysts
  - If sentiment deteriorates despite neutral news, guardrails for downside risk
  - Any red flags to exit or hedge positions

- Makrdown table (final section)
  - A compact table summarizing key observations, catalysts, sentiment direction, and takeaways for easy reference

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the Reddit stock info right away or at a scheduled interval you prefer.
- If you want, I can proceed with the framework now and populate it as soon as the data tool comes back online.

Would you like me to retry immediately, or would you prefer I proceed with the framework and placeholders while we wait?
