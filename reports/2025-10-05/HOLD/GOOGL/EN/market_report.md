I tried to fetch data for GOOGL, but I’m encountering an internal data-access error (FileNotFoundError) from the data source. I can retry the data pull now, or switch to an alternate data feed if you prefer. In the meantime, here’s a carefully selected set of indicators (8 total) that provide complementary insights without redundancy. Once the data fetch works, I’ll generate a detailed, data-driven trend report.

Recommended indicators (8 total)
- close_10_ema: 10-period EMA
  - Why: Captures quick momentum shifts; useful for early entry/exit signals when used with longer-term trends.
- close_50_sma: 50-period SMA
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level; helps filter noise from short-term signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-period SMA
  - Why: Long-term trend backbone; aids in identifying major regime (bullish/bearish) and potential golden/death cross contexts.
- macd: MACD line
  - Why: Core momentum signal; crossovers and divergences help flag trend changes, especially in non-volatile to moderate markets.
- macds: MACD Signal
  - Why: Smoother signal line to confirm MACD-driven signals; reduces false positives when combined with price action.
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  - Why: Visualizes momentum strength and acceleration/deceleration; useful for spotting early momentum shifts and divergences.
- rsi: RSI
  - Why: Momentum gauge for overbought/oversold conditions; useful for identifying potential reversals when aligned with trend context.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA)
  - Why: Dynamic volatility benchmark; helps identify breakout zones and pullbacks relative to a volatility-based baseline.

How I’ll use them (once data is available)
- Confirm trend direction with 50/200 SMA (and cross-check with 10-EMA for timing).
- Use MACD, MACDS, and MACDH to gauge momentum changes and potential conviction for entries/exits.
- Use RSI to assess momentum extremes and potential reversals, but always in the context of the prevailing trend.
- Use Bollinger Middle as the volatility baseline, with Boll upper/lower cues for overextensions and breakout likelihood (note: I’ll avoid over-interpreting without confirming price interaction with the bands).
- The combination aims to balance trend, momentum, and volatility insights, reducing reliance on any single signal.

Next steps
- Please confirm: would you like me to retry the data fetch now using the same date range (2024-10-05 to 2025-10-05) or adjust the range?
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a placeholder illustrative report using typical patterns for Alphabet, but the exact, data-driven details will be generated as soon as the data pull succeeds.

Markdown summary table: key indicators, purpose, and use-case
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How it helps for GOOGL (contextual use) |
|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; quick shifts | Filters entries in choppy markets; complements longer-term trend signals. |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Confirms trend direction and provides a practical baseline for pullbacks. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; major regime indicator | Helps assess whether price is in a broader uptrend or downtrend; risk-on/risk-off context. |
| macd | MACD | Momentum via EMA differences | Signals trend changes; crossovers add conviction when aligned with price action. |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD | Reduces false positives; helps confirm MACD-driven signals. |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength; divergence potential | Visualizes strength/weakening of momentum; early warning of shifts. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold momentum | Highlights potential reversals, especially when in line with trend context. |
| boll | Bollinger Middle | Volatility baseline (20 SMA) | Identifies breakout zones and pullbacks relative to volatility, aiding entry/exit timing. |

I’ll proceed with another data fetch attempt after you confirm, or you can tell me to switch data sources or adjust the date range.
