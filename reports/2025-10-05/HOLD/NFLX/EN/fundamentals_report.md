I attempted to fetch the latest fundamental data for NFLX (Netflix) using the available tools, but the tool environment returned FileNotFoundError for all data requests. I couldn’t retrieve insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow). Because of this, I can’t provide a data-filled, trader-focused fundamental report right now. Here’s how we can proceed and what I can deliver in the meantime.

What I can provide now
- A structured report outline you can fill in once data is retrievable, plus guidance on what to look for in each section.
- A clear plan for re-running the data fetch, and alternative ways to obtain the same data if these tools remain unavailable.

Recommended next steps
- Retry data retrieval: I can attempt to fetch all five data sources again (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) as soon as the tool environment is functioning.
- If retries fail again, we can:
  - Pull data from alternate sources you approve (e.g., public filings, other data providers).
  - Proceed with a qualitative analysis based on recent company news, earnings commentary, and sector context while we wait for exact numbers.

If you want, I can proceed with one of the following:

- Use alternative data sources you approve (public filings, other data providers) and compile the report with those numbers.
- Provide a qualitative, decision-ready outlook for NFLX based on recent public context (earnings themes, subscriber trends, competitive landscape) while we wait for the exact figures.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now or switch to an alternative data source approach?
