Decision: Hold

Rationale
- The provided plan presents a credible bullish monetization thesis (ads, tiering, international monetization), but near-term upside is not compelling enough given the valuation and ad-market/macroeconomic sensitivities.
- The catalysts (advertiser demand, ARPU uplift, CPM expansion, large campaigns) need solid, quarterly data to confirm monetization momentum before committing additional capital unhedged.
- A data-driven upgrade path exists: if the plan’s catalysts materialize (notably sustained ARPU growth and meaningful ad-revenue acceleration), the position can be upgraded to Buy. Conversely, deterioration in subs growth, ARPU, CPMs, or failure of large campaigns to lift monetization would justify maintaining Hold or moving toward Sell with risk controls.

Catalysts and upgrade triggers (to Buy)
- Sustained ARPU expansion driven by ad-tier adoption and higher-tier pricing.
- Ad-revenue momentum outpacing expectations with rising CPMs across multiple regions.
- Measurable lift from large advertiser campaigns (e.g., AB InBev-type endorsements) translating into viewership and monetization gains.
- International subs growth stabilizing with improving monetization/mix and lower churn.
- Free-cash-flow inflection signals showing better cash conversion and efficient content ROI.

Risk management and actions
- If already long, keep a smaller core position with defined risk limits; consider hedging (puts or a collar) to guard against negative headlines while preserving upside optionality.
- If not yet long, consider a cautious starter position or structured exposure to participate in upside only if data confirms the upgrade triggers.
- Establish a lightweight dashboard tracking ARPU by region, ad-revenue growth, CPM trends, churn, and international subs trajectory, with predefined thresholds for upgrade/downgrade decisions.
- Schedule quarterly reviews to reassess thesis in light of new data, and be prepared to adjust to Sell if data deteriorates.

What I’d monitor next (practical steps)
- Track quarterly ARPU growth and ad-revenue progression; look for sustained acceleration rather than one-off beats.
- Monitor CPM trends across key geographies and the rate of ads-take-up in the user base.
- Assess the ROI of large campaigns through engagement metrics and conversion to monetized views.
- Watch international subs trajectory for signs of monetization improvement even if subs growth slows.

Final decision
- Hold now. Upgrade to Buy only if the data confirms durable monetization momentum across ARPU, ad-revenue, CPMs, and large-campaign lift; downgrade toward Sell if those signals weaken or if cost/margin headwinds intensify.
