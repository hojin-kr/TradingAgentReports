I attempted to fetch NFLX data and compute the requested indicators, but the tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). I don’t have the raw data to generate a detailed, data-driven trend report right now. I can retry the data retrieval immediately, or proceed with a structured plan and a best-effort framework using the indicator setup. Which would you prefer? If you’d like, I can retry now and then deliver the full, data-backed analysis as soon as the data comes through.

In the meantime, here is a concise plan and a proposed, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators that would give a diverse view of NFLX’s current setup once data is available. I’ve chosen indicators to cover trend, momentum, volatility, and market context, without overlapping signals excessively.

Proposed indicator set (up to 8, non-redundant)
- close_200_sma (200 SMA): Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm the major direction and potential support/resistance zones around a broad time horizon.
- close_50_sma (50 SMA): Medium-term trend filter; complements the 200SMA to identify potential trend changes (e.g., golden/death cross dynamics) and provides a nearer support/resistance context.
- close_10_ema (10 EMA): Short-term momentum timing; helps flag quick shifts and potential entry/exit points when paired with longer-term averages.
- macd (MACD): Momentum trend signal; crossovers signal potential changes in trend strength; useful in conjunction with position in trend.
- macds (MACD Signal): Smoother confirmation line; MACD crosses with the signal line to reduce false positives.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Momentum strength visualization; divergence with price and changes in histogram can pre-empt trend shifts.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold context and divergence signals; provides a counterpoint to trend indicators.
- boll (Bollinger Middle): Dynamic volatility benchmark via the 20-period SMA; helps contextualize breakouts and mean-reversion tendencies when used with bands.

Rationale for the chosen set
- Combines both trend direction (200SMA, 50SMA, 10EMA) and momentum (MACD trio, RSI) to capture both persistent moves and near-term shifts.
- Includes a volatility anchor (boll middle) to gauge price dispersion and potential breakout or revert-to-mean dynamics.
- Avoids overlapping signals (e.g., no separate stochastic indicators); uses MACD components together for robust momentum signals, RSI for momentum extremes, and moving averages for trend context.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced narrative of NFLX’s current setup, including:
  - Trend alignment across timeframes (short/medium/long) using the 200SMA, 50SMA, and 10EMA.
  - Momentum analysis with MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram, including crossovers and divergences.
  - RSI-driven momentum context, identifying overbought/oversold zones and divergences against price.
  - Volatility/mean-reversion context from Bollinger middle; assessment of how price interacts with the middle line and bands for breakout or reversion signals.
  - A concise interpretation of what the combined signals imply for potential entries, risk management, and position sizing (e.g., using ATR for optional stop placement if you’d like).
- A final summary with scenario-based takeaways (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) and concrete next steps.

Markdown table: key indicators overview (to be filled with data after retrieval)
| Indicator | Category | What it tells you | How to use it (brief) | Current interpretation (pending data) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend direction; major support/resistance | Compare price to 200SMA to gauge trend; look for crossovers with price | Pending data |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction | Use with 200SMA to identify golden/death cross context; dynamic support/resistance | Pending data |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Watch for price crossing above/below the 10EMA for timing | Pending data |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend strength via MACD line | Crosses with MACD Signal to signal potential entries/exits | Pending data |
| macds | MACD Related | Smoothing of MACD; confirmation | Use MACD vs MACD Signal crossovers to confirm signals | Pending data |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength visualization | Look for histogram expansion/contraction and divergences | Pending data |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum speed; overbought/oversold context | Watch 70/30 thresholds and divergences for potential reversals | Pending data |
| boll | Volatility | Central tendency and mean-reversion context via middle band | Use with price-relative to Boll middle and bands to gauge breakouts/reversals | Pending data |

If you’d like me to retry the data fetch now and then generate the full, data-backed analysis with the 8 indicators above, say “Retry data fetch for NFLX,” and I’ll run the calls and deliver a complete, detailed report plus the updated table. Alternatively, if you want to proceed with a purely qualitative framework without the latest data, I can tailor the interpretation approach to your preferred trading horizon and risk tolerance.
