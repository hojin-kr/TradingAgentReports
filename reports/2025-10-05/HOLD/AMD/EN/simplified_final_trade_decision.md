# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD designs CPUs and GPUs for PCs and data centers. Hold with a staged, evidence-based plan; participate only when durable catalysts appear and with tight risk controls.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence: Medium

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- AI infrastructure demand and a broader software platform (ROCm) could generate sustained growth beyond a single surge.
- Enterprise traction is expanding beyond a few customers, improving revenue visibility.
- Product cycle updates (Zen 6 IPC gains, AFMF 2.1) and ongoing PC/gaming momentum support near-term cash flow with potential AI upside later.
- Foundry diversification signals could reduce supply risk, but are not proven yet.
- Valuation already reflects strong growth; durable revenue growth and margin gains are needed to justify larger moves.

## Risks To Watch
- AI spending is cyclical and deals can be uneven; durable, repeatable revenue is not guaranteed.
- Dependence on external foundry partners (like TSMC); diversification plans (e.g., Intel foundry) are uncertain.
- ROCm and software advantages may not match Nvidia’s CUDA breadth or pace; higher research, development, and manufacturing costs could press margins.
- Macro and PC market softness could weigh on AMD’s mix and overall performance.
