Thanks for the prompt on AMD. I attempted to fetch the data and run the indicators, but the backend data retrieval failed with a FileNotFoundError. Specifically:
- get_YFin_data for AMD (2024-04-01 to 2025-10-05) returned a FileNotFoundError.
- An attempt to compute 8 indicators (close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macds, rsi, atr, vwma) also failed for the same reason.

Because the data source isn’t returning data right now, I can’t generate the actual indicator values or a live trend analysis for AMD at this moment. I can either retry in a few minutes, retry now, or proceed with a qualitative plan and a recommended indicator set that would work once data is available.

Recommended indicators to use (up to 8, non-redundant, complementary)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
- macd (MACD Related)
- macds (MACD Signal)
- rsi (Momentum)
- atr (Volatility)
- vwma (Volume-Based)

Why these are suitable for AMD in a typical AI/semiconductors cycle
- close_50_sma: Captures mid-term trend and acts as a dynamic support/resistance; helpful for AMD as it moves in multi-quarter cycles with product launches and enterprise demand.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; useful to confirm macro direction (golden/death cross signals). AMD often trends over multi-quarter horizons depending on AI compute demand and data-center capex.
- close_10_ema: Provides a quicker read on momentum shifts, useful for early entries/exits around strong catalysts (new GPUs, software ecosystems, AI workloads).
- macd and macds: Together they show momentum shifts and trend changes; helpful in confirming trend strength or early reversals in AMD’s volatile price environment.
- rsi: Momentum gauge with classic overbought/oversold cues; AMD can see prolonged momentum in strong uptrends, so RSI should be interpreted with trend context.
- atr: Volatility measure to manage risk and position sizing; AMD price action can be choppy around product cycles and AI demand news, so ATR helps set stops.
- vwma: Volume-weighted trend confirmation; AMD often has volume spikes around earnings days or capex announcements, making VWMA a solid companion to price action.

Proposed plan for when data is available
- Compute the 8 indicators listed above for the AMD ticker.
- Provide a nuanced, time-aligned report with:
  - Trend direction (short/medium/long-term) via SMAs and EMA
  - Momentum signals via MACD lines/crosses and RSI
  - Volatility and risk context via ATR
  - Volume-confirmed trends via VWMA
- Deliver a detailed narrative of how these signals align or diverge, followed by a concise trading framework (entry/exit zones, risk management) based on the current context.

What I can do next
- If you’d like, I can retry to fetch and compute the indicators now. Please confirm you want me to attempt the data retrieval again, or specify a narrower date range (e.g., the last 1 year) to reduce potential data issues.
- If you have a CSV or alternative data source you can share, I can use that to generate the same indicator set.
- Alternatively, I can provide a more strategic, qualitative AMD-focused analysis (without live indicator values) if you’d prefer.

Appendix: quick reference table of the chosen indicators and their roles
| Indicator | Category | Purpose for AMD | How to use (signal concept) |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Mid-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50-SMA suggests trend direction; cross with other signals for entry/exit. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above 200-SMA supports bullish regime; cross with shorter MA for potential trend shifts. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Quick momentum shifts | Price crosses above/below 10-EMA signals near-term momentum changes; filter with longer MA. |
| macd | MACD | Momentum trend changes | MACD line crossing above/below signal indicates potential entry/exit when aligned with trend. |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD | Crosses with MACD for clearer buy/sell cues; helps reduce false signals in choppy markets. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context | RSI extremes (>70 / <30) suggest reversals or continuations depending on trend context. |
| atr | Volatility | Risk management and position sizing | Higher ATR means wider stops; adjust risk and sizing in volatile periods. |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Volume-confirmed trend | Price action above/below VWMA with volume confirms trend strength; watch for volume spikes near catalysts. |

Status: Data retrieval currently blocked by backend error. To proceed, I can retry now or later, or switch to an alternative data source if you provide one. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.
