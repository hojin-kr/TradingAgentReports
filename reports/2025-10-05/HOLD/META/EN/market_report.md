I attempted to fetch META price data, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). I can’t compute the indicators until I have the price data. I can retry the data fetch now, or try a smaller date window or a different data source if you prefer. In the meantime, here is the plan and the set of indicators I will use once data is available, along with why they’re suitable for META in a typical market context.

Selected indicators (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level. Helps identify ongoing trend vs. potential reversals when price crosses it.
- close_200_sma
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming major trend orientation and spotting golden/death cross signals when combined with other timing tools.
- close_10_ema
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum indicator. Captures quick shifts and potential near-term entry/exit points; works well with slower moving averages as a filter.
- macd
  - Why: Momentum signal derived from differences of EMAs. Crossovers and histogram shifts help identify trend changes; good complement to price/MA signals in both trending and range environments.
- macds
  - Why: MACD signal line; using this with MACD helps confirm crossovers and reduces false positives when combined with other filters.
- rsi
  - Why: Momentum strength with overbought/oversold cues. Useful for spotting potential reversals or pullbacks, especially when aligned with trend direction from MA’s and MACD.
- boll_ub
  - Why: Upper Bollinger Band signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones, particularly in the context of a rising trend; can help anticipate moves when price rides the band.
- atr
  - Why: Measures volatility to inform risk management (position sizing, stop placement). Reactive but essential for adapting to changing market volatility.

Notes and expected workflow once data is available
- I will fetch META price data for the requested window.
- I will compute the 8 indicators listed above.
- I will deliver:
  - A nuanced trend report describing:
    - Trend direction and strength from MA crossovers and EMA momentum.
    - MACD crossovers/divergence with histogram interpretation.
    - RSI level context (overbought/oversold and potential divergences).
    - Bollinger band context (boll_ub for breakout/overbought zones, boll_lb if included later for downside pressure).
    - Volatility assessment via ATR for risk management.
  - A concise set of actionable observations for potential entries/exits, including caveats for false signals and market regime shifts.
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing key points (indicators, what they signal, and how they influence decisions).

Request for next step
- Would you like me to retry the data fetch now using META with the same date range, or should I try a shorter window (e.g., 2024-12-01 to 2025-10-05) or a different data source if available? 
- If you have a preferred date range or another ticker variation (e.g., META/GOOGL cross-check), I can adapt the plan accordingly.

Provisional structure for the forthcoming report (to be filled after data is retrieved)
- Executive summary of trend direction and key momentum
- MA and EMA observations (50SMA, 200SMA, 10EMA)
- MACD analysis (macd, macds) with potential crossovers/divergence
- RSI context and any divergences
- Bollinger context (boll_ub) and breakout signals
- ATR-based volatility/risk assessment
- Trade ideas and risk controls (entry, stop, target, sizing)
- Key caveats and regime shift considerations
- Summary table of indicators and their interpretations

Markdown table (to be appended with actual signals once data is available)

- Indicator | Role | What to look for | Implication for META
- close_50_sma | Trend direction & dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA; crossovers | Confirms/modulates trend strength
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above/below 200SMA; golden/death cross signals | Strategic trend confirmation
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10EMA; momentum shifts | Timing for entries/exits
- macd | Momentum convergence/divergence | MACD line vs signal line; histogram direction | Early trend-change cues
- macds | MACD signal crossovers | Crossings with MACD; alignment with histogram | Filter for MACD-based signals
- rsi | Momentum/overbought-oversold | RSI extreme levels; divergences | Reversal risk context
- boll_ub | Overbought/breakout context | Price reaching upper band; band interactions | Breakout/mean-reversion cues
- atr | Volatility & risk management | ATR level changes; recent volatility shifts | Stop sizing and risk limits

If you’d like, I can try the data fetch again right away and proceed with the 8-indicator analysis as soon as it succeeds.
