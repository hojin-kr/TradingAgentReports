Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for META across the requested dates, but the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError for every request in this session. That indicates a data source or tool environment issue right now. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

What happened
- Attempts to pull Reddit-based sentiment for META from 2025-09-29 through 2025-10-05 failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the get_reddit_stock_info tool.
- This means I don’t yet have the day-by-day Reddit sentiment signals to attach to the weekly analysis.

What I can do now
- Provide a robust, trader-focused weekly META analysis framework and write-up that you can use immediately, with placeholders for Reddit sentiment data to be filled in once the tool is back online.
- Once the Reddit tool is functioning again (or if you permit me to use alternate data sources), I can fill in the day-by-day sentiment, themes, and any Reddit-driven price-alike signals.

Draft plan for the META weekly sentiment report (to be updated with data)
- Executive snapshot
  - Short summary of META’s positioning heading into the week (AI push, ad market dynamics, metaverse/NON-VR strategy, regulatory/regulatory risk, earnings cadence).
  - Overall sentiment cue (derived from social, news, and price action) and what it implies for traders.

- Social sentiment overview (high-level)
  - What people are talking about in the past week (AI investments, product launches like Quest or Instagram features, data/privacy concerns, ad-revenue trends).
  - Contrasting threads: optimism about AI/AI tools and pessimism over regulatory risk or ad-market headwinds.

- Daily sentiment digest (to be populated)
  - For each day 2025-09-29 through 2025-10-05: sentiment direction, dominant themes, notable posts or memes, and any sentiment-led signals versus price action.
  - Note: I will fill these with precise day-by-day signals once the Reddit data tool returns data.

- Top themes and catalysts
  - AI and product roadmap: Sentiment around META’s AI strategy, consumer/creator tools, and any product launches.
  - Advertising and monetization: Expectations for ad growth, privacy changes, iOS-like shifts, and monetization signals.
  - Metaverse/Reality Labs: Public sentiment on the viability and progress, headset launches, developer ecosystem.
  - Regulation and policy: Any trending concerns about antitrust scrutiny, data privacy, or content moderation.

- News catalysts (past week)
  - Key corporate/news items that could drive sentiment: earnings chatter, analyst notes, partnerships, regulatory updates, or product announcements.

- Sentiment vs price and volatility
  - Correlation observations between Reddit sentiment signals and META’s price/volatility in the past week.
  - Any divergence (e.g., positive sentiment with flat price) and potential explanations.

- Risk factors and counterpoints
  - Moderating factors that could blunt sentiment-driven moves: regulatory risk, macro ad-market weakness, competitive pressure (e.g., Google, TikTok), monetization headwinds, or cadence/scale of product releases.
  - Positive risk offsets: stronger-than-expected ad demand, AI monetization opportunities, user growth metrics, or successful platform monetization experiments.

- Trader takeaways and scenarios
  - If sentiment remains positive: potential breakout scenarios, key levels to watch (support/resistance, 50/200-day moving averages if relevant).
  - If sentiment turns negative: risk of pullbacks, hedging considerations, and stop-loss positioning cues.
  - Reaction expectations to specific catalysts (e.g., a major product update or regulatory news).

- Practical implications for portfolios
  - Suggested positioning ideas (e.g., long exposure on pullbacks with defined risk, or cautious stance around key dates).
  - Risk management notes for META exposure in technology/advertising weights.

What I need from you to finalize the full report with day-by-day Reddit sentiment
- If you want me to proceed immediately, I can deliver the full structured report now with the day-by-day sentiment sections left as data-points to be inserted once the Reddit tool is back online.
- Alternatively, I can proceed if you give me permission to substitute Reddit data with another sentiment source (e.g., public sentiment from other social platforms or a general market sentiment proxy) for the week.
- Please indicate if you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch now or wait until the tool is available again.

Appendix: Markdown table (structure to organize key points)
Note: This table is designed to be filled with the day-by-day Reddit sentiment data once available. For now, it contains placeholders.

| Date (UTC) | Reddit Sentiment (score -1 to 1) | Top Daily Threads / Themes | Key News Catalyst | Implied Price Direction | Dominant Risks | Trader Takeaway |

| 2025-10-05 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

Next steps
- If you want me to proceed with the full report using this structure now, I can deliver a polished version with placeholders replaced as soon as Reddit sentiment data comes back.
- If you prefer, I can switch to an alternative data source for sentiment today and deliver a completed weekly report, then swap in Reddit data later when available.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with the report using alternate sentiment inputs?
