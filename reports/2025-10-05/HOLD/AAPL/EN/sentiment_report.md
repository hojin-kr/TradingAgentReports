Thanks for the patience. The Reddit stock info fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I’m unable to pull the latest data right now. I’ll retry shortly, but in the meantime here’s a comprehensive long-form framework and placeholder content for the AAPL sentiment/news analysis. Once the data tool is functioning again, I’ll fill in the specifics and update all sections accordingly.

Executive snapshot
- Objective: Assess public sentiment and recent news around Apple (AAPL) over the past week to identify traders’ mood shifts, potential catalysts, and risk factors.
- What to expect from data when available: daily sentiment deltas, top themes in social posts, notable posts, unified sentiment trend, and a news digest with catalysts (product updates, earnings expectations, regulatory/regulatory-oversight themes, supply-chain notes, and macro factors).
- Trader takeaway (pre-data): Given Apple’s scale and product cycle, expect sensitivity to product announcements, services growth trajectory, guidance on margins, and any regulatory/regulatory-compliance headlines. Prepare for mixed sentiment around evolving hardware/software ecosystems and potential impacts from macro sentiment (rates, consumer demand signals).

Social sentiment panorama (7 days) — framework
- Daily sentiment distribution (positive, neutral, negative)
- Net sentiment (positive minus negative) per day
- Top themes by volume (e.g., product, services, supply chain, privacy, AI integration)
- Notable posts/voices (e.g., influential retail/retail-trader communities, industry analysts)
- Anomalies: sudden spikes in chatter tied to a specific event or rumor
- Expected data output once tool returns: a day-by-day table plus a themes cloud or bullet list for each day.

News and events digest — framework
- Categorize news into:
  - Product/Product-cycle: updates, launches, or rumors
  - Financials and guidance: earnings timing, street expectations, margins, guidance shifts
  - Services and ecosystem: App Store dynamics, fitness/health/AR initiatives, witness to services growth
  - Regulation and policy: antitrust, privacy, export controls, tariffs, compliance matters
  - Supply chain and operations: supplier news, manufacturing constraints, capacity changes
  - Macro context: consumer demand signals, FX effects, interest rate environment
- For each item: source, date, signal strength (positive/negative/neutral), potential market impact, and duration (transient vs. persistent).
- Expected data output once tool returns: a curated list of the latest 7–10 items with sentiment tags and a short impact note.

Key drivers and interpretation framework
- Product cycle and innovation tempo: leverage for revenue growth versus risk of incremental updates.
- Services acceleration vs hardware cycle headwinds: balance of Services revenue vs device demand.
- Margin trajectory: impact of mix (hardware vs services), component costs, and pricing power.
- Regulatory/regulatory-compliance risk: potential impact on user trust and platform economics.
- Macro and consumer health signals: how changes in consumer spending, FX, and rates could influence the stock.
- Correlation lens: compare sentiment trajectory with price/volume moves over the same 7-day window to gauge sentiment-price alignment or divergence.

Risk factors and scenarios
- Upside scenario: Positive product news or better-than-expected services growth lifts sentiment and price, supported by constructive commentary from major analysts.
- Base scenario: Mixed sentiment with selective catalysts (e.g., a modest product refresh or favorable services data) keeping price range-bound.
- Downside scenario: Negative product/price pressure, regulatory concerns, or macro shocks dampen demand sentiment; risk of a pullback.
- Tail risks: Significant supply chain disruption, unexpected regulatory hurdles, or a material guidance miss.

Trader takeaway and actionable signals
- If daily sentiment turns consistently positive with supportive news catalysts, consider size-up opportunities on strength breaks or pullbacks near key support levels.
- If sentiment deteriorates but news remains modestly neutral, anticipate volatility; prefer hedged or options-based strategies to monetize short-term moves.
- Watch for sentiment reversals around earnings timing, product announcements, or regulatory updates; these are likely to drive quick repricing.
- Limit risk with stop levels aligned to macro regime shifts and to critical price levels (e.g., recent swing lows/highs).

Appendix: data sources and methodology
- Social sentiment sources: Reddit boards (e.g., r/StockMarket, r/investing), X (Twitter), StockTwits, retail investor forums.
- News sources: major financial outlets, Apple-focused tech blogs, press releases, regulatory filings.
- Methodology: sentiment scoring, topic modeling for themes, event tagging, and correlation analysis between sentiment metrics and price action.

Markdown table: key points at a glance
- Data pull status: pending (tool error encountered)
- Latest data source status: awaiting tool recovery
- Primary sentiment trend indicator: TBD
- Major catalysts to watch: TBD
- Short-term trading implication: TBD
- Risk factors highlighted: TBD
- Next steps: retry data pull now; if tool remains unavailable, proceed with structured qualitative interpretation and await data refresh

What I’ll do next
- I’ll retry the Reddit stock info fetch for AAPL with the current date (2025-10-05) immediately. If the tool remains unavailable, I’ll switch to delivering a data-driven outline (as above) and clearly label sections that require data insertion.
- Once data returns, I’ll populate:
  - Day-by-day sentiment table (positive/neutral/negative, volume, and delta)
  - Top themes for each day
  - News digest with sentiment signals and potential market impact
  - Updated trader guidance based on actual observed data

Would you like me to proceed with the retry now and fill in the specifics as soon as the tool responds, or would you prefer I proceed immediately with the fully populated framework and placeholders (to be replaced once data is back)?
