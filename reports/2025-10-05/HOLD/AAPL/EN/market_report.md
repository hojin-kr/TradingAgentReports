I attempted to fetch AAPL data for 2024-04-01 to 2025-10-05 but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError in this environment. It looks like the data source layer is currently unavailable or misconfigured. I can retry shortly or switch to an alternate data path if you’d like, but I’ll need your confirmation. In the meantime, I can still lay out a concrete plan and select a complementary set of indicators to study once data is retrievable, so we can jump straight into a detailed, nuanced analysis as soon as the data comes through.

Recommended indicator set for AAPL (up to 8 indicators; chosen for complementary insights and to avoid redundancy)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the prevailing trend and filter noisy entries.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming macro-trend regime (bullish if price above, bearish if below; watch for golden/death cross signals with other timing tools).
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action. Good for timing entries when used with longer moving averages.
- macd: Core momentum indicator that highlights trend-change signals via MACD line behavior and crossovers.
- macds: MACD Signal line. Crossovers with MACD provide more robust entry/exit timing when used with other filters.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator that flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences in momentum, useful for anticipating reversals within the price trend.
- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band. Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones; helps identify price extension and resistance areas in conjunction with other signals.
- atr: Volatility gauge to inform risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and to understand regime shifts in price action.

Why this set is suitable for AAPL in a late-2025 context (conceptual rationale)
- Trend clarity: The dual use of 50-SMA and 200-SMA provides both medium- and long-term trend context, which is valuable for a name like AAPL that can exhibit extended trend phases punctuated by pullbacks.
- Timing with momentum: The 10-EMA adds responsiveness to shifting momentum, while MACD and MACD Signal give a broader momentum view that’s less prone to whipsaws than a single indicator.
- Reversion potential: RSI adds a check on whether a move is overextended, which helps avoid chasing rallies in overbought zones or buying dips in deeply oversold conditions that may be part of a downtrend.
- Volatility and risk control: ATR gives practical guidance for setting stops and sizing positions to reflect current volatility, which is particularly important around earnings events, product cycles, or macro shifts that impact AAPL.
- Price extension cues: Upper Bollinger Band helps identify potential breakout zones or continued extension in strong moves when price rides the band, especially useful in trend-following paradigms.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced trend report for AAPL that weaves together the 8 indicators above, covering:
  - Trend assessment: Where is price relative to the 50-SMA and 200-SMA? Are there crossovers suggesting regime shifts?
  - Momentum: What do MACD (and its signal) imply about current momentum? Is RSI supporting a continuation or signaling a reversal risk?
  - Volatility and risk: What is ATR telling us about current volatility and how should that influence stop placement and position sizing?
  - Extension vs. mean-reversion: Are prices near or beyond Bollinger Upper Band, suggesting potential pullback, or are they consolidating inside bands with a breakout possibility?
  - Timing and confirmation: Do short-term signals (10-EMA) align with MACD and RSI, or is there a misalignment that warrants caution?
  - Contextual interpretation: How do all signals fit within the broader market backdrop for tech/consumer electronics, earnings cycles, and macro factors as of 2025-10-05?
- A concise action-oriented plan tailored to AAPL (e.g., potential entries, exits, and risk controls) grounded in the integrated indicator readings.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points and behavioral signals for quick reference.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now, or you can request a different date window or a specific data source. If you’d like me to retry, please confirm and I’ll attempt again immediately.
- If you want to proceed with a qualitative, data-free analysis in the meantime (not as precise as data-driven), I can provide a high-level overview of typical AAPL behavior in late-2025 contexts and how these indicators would conceptually react in various scenarios.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry fetching AAPL data for the original window (2024-04-01 to 2025-10-05) now, or
2) Try a different date range, or
3) Move ahead with a qualitative, data-free analysis using the indicator framework above?

Proposed summarized indicators table (for quick reference)
- Indicator: close_50_sma | What it signals: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Trade use: Confirm trend, look for pullbacks to the 50-SMA for entries in uptrends; use with faster momentum tools for timing.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | What it signals: Long-term trend regime; macro-trend confirmation | Trade use: Bullish when price and shorter-term averages stay above; watch for golden/death cross with shorter averages.
- Indicator: close_10_ema | What it signals: Short-term momentum shifts | Trade use: Spot quick momentum changes; pair with longer-term trend for entries.
- Indicator: macd | What it signals: Momentum/trend-change potential via MACD line crossovers | Trade use: Use crossovers as timing aids in conjunction with other filters.
- Indicator: macds | What it signals: MACD signal line crossovers | Trade use: Trap false signals by requiring MACD cross with confirmation from other indicators.
- Indicator: rsi | What it signals: Overbought/oversold momentum extremes | Trade use: Watch for divergences and bound ranges within a trend; use with trend cues for better reversal timing.
- Indicator: boll_ub | What it signals: Potential overbought extension and breakout zones | Trade use: Confirm breakouts or pullbacks with other momentum/volume signals.
- Indicator: atr | What it signals: Current market volatility | Trade use: Set position sizes and stops adaptively; interpret rising ATR as widening stops and potential regime changes.

If you confirm, I’ll proceed with data retrieval as soon as the data source is available and generate the full, detailed report with the 8 indicators and the final table.
