I ran the data retrieval for TSLA (2024-01-01 to 2025-10-05), but the data fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a backend issue rather than a TSLA-specific problem. I can retry immediately, or we can try a shorter date range or a different data window. Let me know your preference. In the meantime, I’ll outline the 8 most relevant indicators I’d run once the data is available and why they fit TSLA’s typical trading context.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale for TSLA
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - TSLA context: Helps identify the prevailing trend and provides a reference for pullbacks within the trend. Useful for filtering trades initiated by faster signals.

- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and potential golden/death cross signals.
  - TSLA context: Important for strategic bias (bullish if price sits above the 200 SMA; bearish if below). Crosses can signal stronger regime changes.

- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  - Purpose: Reactive short-term momentum and potential entry/exit inflection points.
  - TSLA context: In a stock known for rapid moves, the 10 EMA helps catch quick shifts, especially when price is already aligned with longer-term trend.

- macd (MACD line)
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals via momentum crossovers.
  - TSLA context: Useful for spotting shifts in momentum, particularly when price is trending strongly or transitioning between regimes.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Purpose: EMA-smoothed signal for MACD crossovers.
  - TSLA context: Helps reduce false signals from the MACD line alone and provides confirmations for entries/exits.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Purpose: Visual momentum strength and divergence indication.
  - TSLA context: Divergences between price and MACD histogram can precede reversals, offering early warning in volatile moves.

- rsi (RSI)
  - Purpose: Momentum strength and testing overbought/oversold conditions (commonly 70/30 thresholds).
  - TSLA context: Useful for spotting potential reversals when momentum is extreme, but should be filtered with trend (RSI alone can stay stretched in strong trends).

- atr (Average True Range)
  - Purpose: Volatility measurement to inform risk management and position sizing.
  - TSLA context: Practical for setting stop levels and adjusting risk exposure in a stock known for episodic, high-volatility moves.

Notes on how I’d interpret these together (once data is available)
- Trend framing: Use price relative to 50 SMA and 200 SMA to gauge the overall regime (uptrend if price/geometry above both with occasional pullbacks; downtrend if below both).
- Trend strength and timing: MACD components (macd, macds, macdh) will help confirm momentum shifts and reduce timing risk from a single indicator.
- Momentum checks: RSI presence above 70 or below 30 would flag potential overextension or overshoot, but I’d confirm with MACD and price position relative to moving averages.
- Volatility risk: ATR will guide how wide stops should be and how much risk to take on a given TSLA move; higher ATR suggests wider buffers.
- Volume context (optional in this set): If you want to add VWMA later, it would help verify trend under volume pressure; for now the 8 indicators above keep a clean, non-redundant set.

What I’ll deliver once data is back
- A detailed, nuanced TSLA trend report covering:
  - Trend direction and regime (using 50 SMA and 200 SMA as core anchors).
  - Momentum signals (MACD components and RSI, with divergences noted).
  - Entry/exit probabilities based on crossovers and price interactions with short-term moving averages.
  - Volatility and risk framing with ATR (stop placement guidance).
  - A concise conclusion and scenario-based guidance (e.g., if TSLA remains above 200 SMA and MACD line crosses above signal, bias remains bullish; if RSI diverges while price trends, watch for a potential pullback).

Next steps
- Please tell me if you’d like me to retry the data fetch now (or specify a different date window, e.g., last 1 year or last 6 months).
- If you’re ok with it, I’ll run the data retrieval and then generate the 8-indicator report with a detailed TSLA analysis and a final actionable outlook.

Key indicators table (summary)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark and regime signals
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum and quick entry/exit points
- macd: Momentum and trend-change signals (line crossovers)
- macds: MACD signal line cross confirmations
- macdh: MACD histogram momentum strength and divergence
- rsi: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold signals
- atr: Volatility for risk management and stop placement

If you’d like me to proceed with a retry now, say “retry TSLA data fetch” and I’ll attempt again and then produce a full indicator-based report.
