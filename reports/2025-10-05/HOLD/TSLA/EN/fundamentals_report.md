I ran into a data-access issue trying to fetch TSLA fundamentals. The tools returned a FileNotFoundError for all requested data streams (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement). I can’t retrieve the latest figures right now.

What I can do right now
- Provide a robust framework and detailed guidance for the TSLA fundamental report, so when the data tools come back online, I can plug in the exact numbers quickly.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-informed overview based on publicly known factors up to 2024/2025 (without exact quarterly figures), and clearly mark where precise numbers would go once data access is restored.
- Alternatively, you can retry in a few minutes, or provide the data you have (CSV/JSON) and I’ll build the full report around it.

What the final report will include (once data is available)
- Company profile and business model
  - Brief overview of Tesla, Inc., core segments (Automotive, Energy Generation and Storage, Services & Other), and geographic mix
  - Competitive positioning (EV leadership, software stack, charging network, energy products)
- Financial headline snapshot (latest quarterly/annual)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income
  - Cash flow from operations, capex, free cash flow
  - Balance sheet highlights: cash, debt, equity, liquidity metrics
- Income statement deep dive
  - Trend analysis of revenue by segment, gross margin evolution, operating margin, profitability drivers/drag
  - R&D and SG&A as a % of revenue; impact of regulatory credits if applicable
- Balance sheet and liquidity
  - Asset composition, debt maturity profile, leverage ratios, liquidity coverage
- Cash flow analysis
  - Operating cash flow drivers, capital allocation (capex strategy, buybacks/dividends, equity raises if any)
  - Free cash flow trend and uses
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Summary of sentiment signals (optimism/pessimism) and notable insider purchases/sales
  - Interpretation for potential near-term catalysts or risk factors
- Growth and risk drivers
  - Production/supply chain dynamics (manufacturing capacity, new gigafactories, ramp of new platforms)
  - Energy business trajectory (storage projects, solar)
  - Regulatory, competitive landscape (EV peers, margins, price competition)
  - Macro sensitivity (chip supply, rate environment, subsidies)
- Valuation context (qualitative, with caveats)
  - How the fundamental drivers compare to market expectations
  - Key levers for upside vs. downside risk in the near term
- Trader-oriented insights
  - What the fundamentals imply for different trading theses (long, short, or options strategies)
  - Specific catalysts and timeframes to watch (production milestones, product launches, energy deals, regulatory decisions)

Proposed Markdown table at the end
- The table will be organized with key points, current values (from the data), trend notes, and sources. Example columns:
  - Key Point
  - TSLA Value (latest)
  - Trend (up/down/mixed)
  - Rationale
  - Data Source / Date

Next steps
- Option A: Retry data retrieval now. If it works, I’ll compile the full report with all sections and the final Markdown table.
- Option B: You provide the latest figures you have (or allow me to use public summaries) and I’ll assemble the report around those numbers.
- Option C: I proceed with a qualitative, data-supported analysis using public knowledge up to 2024/2025 and clearly label any numbers as not current until data is retrieved.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the qualitative framework or a semi-quantitative draft based on public information?
