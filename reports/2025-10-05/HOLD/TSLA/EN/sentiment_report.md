I ran into a tool error while trying to fetch Reddit stock info for TSLA on 2025-10-05. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t retrieve the latest social sentiment data right this moment. I can either retry the data pull now or proceed with a solid report framework you can populate once the data comes back.

Options:
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately.
- Proceed with framework: I’ll deliver a comprehensive long-form TSLA sentiment/news analysis framework and a ready-to-fill Markdown table, so you can plug in the data as soon as it’s available.

If you’d like me to proceed with the framework now, here is the structure I will deliver, plus a ready-to-fill table at the end.

Draft TSLA Social Sentiment and News Analysis framework (past week)
1) Executive snapshot
- What this section covers: high-level sentiment direction, major social themes, and key news catalysts over the past 7 days.
- What to include: overall sentiment tone (positive/neutral/negative), whether sentiment is improving or deteriorating, and any clear catalysts (e.g., major EV/tech announcements, production updates, price changes).

2) Daily sentiment breakdown (7 days)
- For each day: sentiment score (e.g., positive/neutral/negative or a numeric 0–100), post volume, and a short note on why sentiment shifted (new posts, memes, or events).
- Identify any spikes in posting activity and correlate with headlines or events.

3) Top social themes and drivers
- Common themes across posts (e.g., EV demand, production ramp, robotaxi/AI chatter, price cuts, FSD/safety, energy products (Powerwall/Powerpack), competition).
- How strongly each theme is driving sentiment, and whether themes align with or contradict recent company statements or earnings.

4) News roundup (past 7 days)
- Brief digest of notable company news and external coverage.
- Implications for sentiment and price: potential catalysts or overhangs.
- Cross-reference with social sentiment shifts to identify sentiment levers (e.g., a negative ruling followed by negative posts).

5) Price and market reaction (where data is available)
- Any intraday/close price moves associated with the sentiment shifts or news headlines.
- If price data isn’t pulled by the tool, note TSLA price context from public sources and how sentiment could plausibly relate to moves.

6) Risk assessment and trader implications
- Key risk factors seen in social discourse (e.g., overhype around AI features, supply chain constraints, regulatory scrutiny).
- Quick read for traders: probability of continued sentiment momentum, potential reversals, and notable catalysts to watch.

7) Opportunities and cautions for traders
- Where sentiment supports momentum trades (e.g., rising positive sentiment around a new product).
- Cautions about overreactions, meme-driven hype, or information gaps.

8) Quick-recap and actionable signals
- 2–3 concise takeaways for traders, including any near-term catalysts to monitor (product launches, earnings cadence, regulatory updates, deliveries)

Proposed data table (to be filled after data retrieval)
- I will append a Markdown table at the end with the following columns:
  - Date
  - Net Sentiment (scale or qualitative: Positive/Neutral/Negative)
  - Post Volume (approximate)
  - Top Themes/Drivers (2–3 keywords)
  - Notable Posts or Post Themes (short descriptor)
  - News Headline (brief)
  - Price Move (intraday/close, if data available)
  - Catalyst or Event (brief)

Example template (placeholders)
| Date       | Net Sentiment | Post Volume | Top Themes/Drivers | Notable Posts/Themes | News Headline | Price Move | Catalyst/Event |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|------------|----------------|

Notes and next steps
- If you want me to proceed with the data pull now, say “Retry data pull” and I’ll attempt the Reddit stock info fetch again.
- If you prefer to proceed with the framework first, I’ll populate it with concrete data as soon as the tool returns results, and I’ll fill in the Markdown table accordingly.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the framework and table as a template?
