Sorry about that — the Reddit stock info tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError) when I tried to fetch PLTR data for 2025-10-05. I can’t retrieve the Reddit sentiment data right now. I can proceed in a couple of ways, and you can tell me which you prefer:

Options
1) Retry now or after a short delay: I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again and then generate the full long-form report with daily sentiment, themes, and news context.
2) Proceed with a qualitative, best-effort analysis: I’ll provide a detailed, trader-focused analysis based on general sentiment drivers, known catalysts, and typical reactions around PLTR in this timeframe, clearly labeled as qualitative without the Reddit data numbers.
3) Alternate data sources (if you authorize): I can incorporate sentiment and news from other sources you want me to consider (e.g., Twitter/X, Stocktwits, news wires). Note: I currently only have the Reddit tool in this setup, so I’d need access or an alternative tool to pull from other sources.

What I can deliver right now (with a placeholder until data comes in)
- A comprehensive long-form PLTR sentiment and news analysis for the past week, focused on:
  - Social sentiment cues: overall tone shifts, recurring themes (AI productization, government contracts, data privacy, competition, valuation concerns).
  - Daily sentiment cadence: notable spikes or pullbacks, and possible correlations with price moves.
  - Top themes and risk signals from discussions (e.g., adoption traction, partner signals, regulatory noise, or headline risk).
  - Recent company news and guidance (earnings, product announcements, partnerships, regulatory or policy highlights).
  - Implications for traders: suggested scenarios (bullish, bearish, neutral), probable price reactions, and risk factors.
  - Practical takeaways for positioning, such as entry/exit considerations, stop levels, and portfolio context.

Provisional report structure (to be filled with data when available)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment tilt, headline catalysts, and implied risk/reward.
- Social sentiment analysis (past 7 days): daily sentiment direction, volume of posts, and notable threads.
- Thematic analysis: top 5 recurring themes with sentiment weights.
- News and catalysts (past week): summary of headlines and their potential market impact.
- Price action context: how sentiment matched or diverged from price moves, with rough correlation notes.
- Risks and tail risks: regulatory, competitive, execution, and macro sensitivities.
- Trading implications: scenarios, risk controls, and suggested tactical moves.
- Appendix: data caveats and methodology notes.

Appendix: Markdown table (structure for key points)
Date | Daily Sentiment | Post Volume | Top Themes | Notable Posts | News Catalyst | Price Impact | Notes
----- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----
YYYY-MM-DD | Positive/Neutral/Negative | Count | Theme1; Theme2; ... | Link/ID snippets | News headline | +/− % move or rationale | Any caveats

If you’d like me to proceed now with a best-effort qualitative analysis (no Reddit data), tell me “Proceed with qualitative.” If you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch, say “Retry Reddit data,” and I’ll attempt again as soon as I can.

Would you like me to proceed with a qualitative analysis now, or should I retry the Reddit fetch and then generate the full report with daily sentiment data?
