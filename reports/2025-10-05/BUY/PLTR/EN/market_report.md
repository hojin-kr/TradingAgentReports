I attempted to pull PLTR data and the associated indicators, but I’m hitting an internal data-tool error (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data sources. I can retry or switch to an alternate data source, but I don’t have a valid dataset to compute the indicators right now. If you’d like, I can:

- Retry fetching PLTR data now, or
- Try a narrower date window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to see if the issue is range-bound, or
- Proceed with a scenario-based analysis using typical patterns (without live numbers), then update with real data once the fetch succeeds.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) for PLTR and why they’re complementary
To provide a well-rounded view without redundancy, I’d use the following 8 indicators:

1) close_50_sma
- What it tells you: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why useful for PLTR: Helps confirm whether the stock is in a sustained up/down phase and where price might stall.

2) close_200_sma
- What it tells you: Long-term trend baseline and major support/resistance zone.
- Why useful for PLTR: Useful for confirming structural trend (e.g., golden cross or death cross) and aligning risk with principal trend.

3) close_10_ema
- What it tells you: Responsive short-term momentum.
- Why useful for PLTR: Captures quicker shifts in price momentum to spot potential entries/exits when paired with longer-term indicators.

4) macd
- What it tells you: Momentum shifts via differences of EMAs; trend strength and potential reversals.
- Why useful for PLTR: Helps confirm trend changes suggested by price and moving averages; good for catching early momentum shifts.

5) macds
- What it tells you: MACD signal line smoothing; crossovers with MACD line trigger signals.
- Why useful for PLTR: Adds a confirmation layer to MACD cross signals and helps reduce false entries.

6) macdh
- What it tells you: MACD histogram momentum divergence/strength.
- Why useful for PLTR: Visualizes momentum acceleration or deceleration; complements MACD line signals.

7) atr
- What it tells you: Market volatility level and how much price moves on average.
- Why useful for PLTR: Supports risk management (stop placement, position sizing) especially in a volatile stock like PLTR.

8) vwma
- What it tells you: Volume-weighted moving average; price movement aligned with volume.
- Why useful for PLTR: Validates price action with volume, helps distinguish volume-supported moves from price noise, and can confirm breakout/breakdown quality.

Notes on interpretation (when data is available)
- Trend view: Look for price above/below the 50 and 200 SMAs. A rising 50 above the 200 (and price above both) supports a bullish context; a cross of 50 over 200 (golden cross) is a stronger bullish signal if accompanied by rising RSI and positive MACD histogram.
- Momentum view: MACD line crossing above the signal line (with MACD histogram rising) supports bullish momentum; a cross below supports bearish momentum. The 10-EMA vs price gives a fast read on near-term momentum alignment.
- Volatility/risk view: ATR rising suggests higher risk/volatility; use to adjust stops and position sizes. If ATR spikes while price breaks a key level, confirm with VWMA and MACD for breakout validity.
- Volume confirmation: Price moves that ride above/below the VWMA with strong volume are generally more reliable than moves on light volume. A price reversion near VWMA after an overextended rally could indicate a potential pullback.

What I’ll deliver once the data fetch succeeds
- A detailed, nuanced temperature-check of PLTR’s current state using the 8 indicators above.
- A narrative that covers: trend direction, momentum strength/weakness, volatility ambiance, and volume-backed confirmation.
- Practical trade considerations: potential entry/exit zones, risk controls (stop placement guided by ATR), and alignment with major trend (50/200 SMA) and momentum signals (MACD, RSI if added later).
- A concise watchlist of likely near-term scenarios (bullish continuation, consolidation range, bearish reversal) with criteria based on the indicators.

Markdown table: key indicators, what they indicate, and how to use them for PLTR
| Indicator | What it Indicates | Practical use for PLTR |
|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Check trend direction; use as a baseline for pullbacks/retracements |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend baseline; major support/resistance | Confirm overarching trend; watch for golden/death cross signals |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum shifts | Spot quick momentum changes; use with longer-term filters to time entries |
| macd | Momentum and trend-change signals via EMA differences | Confirm trend changes; use with price/MA signals to validate entries |
| macds | MACD signal line momentum; cross signals | Adds confidence to MACD-driven entries/exits; reduces false positives |
| macdh | Momentum strength via MACD histogram | Divergence awareness; gauge momentum acceleration/deceleration |
| atr | Market volatility level | Calibrate stops/position sizing; gauge risk when entering trades |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed price movement | Validate moves with volume; prefer signals that ride on volume-supported moves |

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry pulling the data now. Please confirm and I’ll run the data fetch again and then produce a full, data-backed interpretation using the 8 indicators above.
- If you prefer a quick analysis now without live data, I can provide scenario-based interpretations for PLTR with the same indicator framework, and you can decide how to proceed once data returns.
