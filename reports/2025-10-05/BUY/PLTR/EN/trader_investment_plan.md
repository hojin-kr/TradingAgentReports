Decision: Proceed with the staged Buy plan now. Initiate a modest pilot and scale into catalysts.

Rationale (why now)
- The bull thesis centers on Palantir’s platform moat (Foundry/Gotham), durable government-adjacent backlog, and expanding cross-sell into regulated enterprises. International deals and AI-enabled governance workflows add optionality and potential margin upside as deployment scales.
- Risks are real (government spending volatility, concentrate backlog, international execution, valuation) but manageable with a staged approach, hedges, and clear catalysts. The plan’s emphasis on verifiable milestones reduces reliance on sentiment.

Execution plan (how to implement now)
1) Position sizing
- Start with a modest initial allocation: 1–2% of the portfolio to PLTR as a pilot.
- Prepare to add incrementally on constructive catalysts (and after any meaningful price pullbacks that hold above key levels).

2) Add-on criteria (catalysts)
- Credible remediation milestones publicly updated and verifiable.
- Notable contract momentum (new government or international deals, enterprise wins).
- Evidence of expanding enterprise footprint or international activity beyond current programs.
- Positive, sustained price action around catalysts (confirming trend + volume support).

3) Risk controls and hedging
- Use ATR-based sizing for each increment and place predefined stops/trailing stops.
- Consider a protective hedge (collar or short-term puts) around major milestones to cap downside while preserving upside participation.
- Avoid over-concentration; keep PLTR as a satellite position relative to core holdings.

4) Technical/data framework (when available)
- Monitor price action relative to key moving averages (e.g., price above a rising 50-day and 200-day, with positive momentum signals). Use MACD, VWMA, and volume confirmations as confirmatory signals before larger additions.
- If data tools are online, apply the eight-indicator rule-based triggers for additions/exits; otherwise, rely on catalysts + price/volume signals.

5) Monitoring cadence
- Weekly: headlines, remediation milestones, and contract momentum.
- Daily: macro headlines affecting defense/AI spending; price-action around catalysts.
- Reassess every 0–4 weeks for trigger validation or reallocation needs.

6) Contingency plan
- If remediation milestones stall or major contract momentum disappoints for an extended period, scale back or exit to protect capital.
- If multiple catalysts land and signals align, progressively raise exposure.

Timeline and milestones
- 0–4 weeks: Establish initial pilot, implement hedges, and set price-reaction thresholds around any public milestones.
- 1–3 months: Confirm catalysts; add on validated milestones or favorable price action/volatility context.
- 6–12 months: Reassess sizing on durable catalysts and data-backed signals; adjust exposure up or trim if milestones miss.

Learning and discipline
- Distinguish durable milestones from noise; rely on verifiable catalysts.
- Use multi-signal confirmation rather than a single narrative.
- Maintain defined risk controls (stops, hedges, staged adds) to prevent drift.

If you’d like, I can proceed with the staged Buy now and adjust dynamically as catalysts land and data signals come online. Would you prefer I start the pilot immediately with the 1–2% allocation and establish the initial catalyst-driven add-on plan, or wait briefly for any additional guidance on specific catalysts to prioritize?
