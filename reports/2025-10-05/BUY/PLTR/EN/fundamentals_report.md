I’m running into a data-access error on the tool layer right now. All requested PLTR data fetches (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) returned a FileNotFoundError from the environment. I attempted a parallel pull and a single-call pull for insider sentiment, but the issue persists. Until the data sources come back online, I can’t provide the latest figures or insider activity specifics.

What I can do now
- Provide a structured plan for the full fundamental report and what I’ll include as soon as the data tools are available.
- Offer a high-level PLTR fundamentals framework you can rely on for traders, with a ready-to-fill Markdown table at the end.

Proposed plan once the data tools are back
- Pull the latest quarterly balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statements (SimFin) to capture:
  - Liquidity and leverage (cash, debt, current ratio)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and trend in operating efficiency
  - Cash flow health (operating cash flow, investing, financing; free cash flow)
- Pull insider sentiment and insider transactions (Finnhub) for the past 15 days to gauge management and insiders’ confidence.
- Synthesize into a comprehensive report with:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Revenue mix and line-item trends across government vs. commercial (Foundry vs. Gotham)
  - Profitability trajectory and margin trends
  - Cash flow dynamics and liquidity
  - Balance sheet strength and leverage risk
  - Insider sentiment/transactions read-through and potential signals
  - Key risks, catalysts, and qualitative implications for traders
  - A concise set of trade considerations (short/medium-term thesis, risk controls)
- Deliver a Markdown-formatted table at the end to organize the key takeaways.

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetches automatically in a moment, or you can authorize me to proceed with a qualitative, data-light view in the meantime and fill in the numbers later when the tools are available.

Requested action
- Do you want me to retry the data pulls now (in hopes the environment recovers shortly), or should I proceed with a qualitative PLTR fundamentals framework and placeholders until the data tools return?

Markdown table (structure) — to be filled once data is retrieved

If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative write-up now (without fresh quarterly numbers) and then pop in the exact figures as soon as the data tools return. Just let me know which path you’d like.
