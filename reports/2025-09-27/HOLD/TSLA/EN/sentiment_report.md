I’m running into a backend tool error with the Reddit stock info fetch for TSLA on 2025-09-27. The tool returns a FileNotFoundError and repeated retries have failed. I can’t pull the latest sentiment from Reddit at the moment.

What would you like me to do next?
- Option A: Retry now or try an alternate date range (e.g., the past 7 days, or 2025-09-20 to 2025-09-27) to see if the data source comes back.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, non-dataset-based analysis of TSLA sentiment using other public signals (news headlines, official statements, market commentary) and outline likely themes, without exact day-by-day sentiment scores.
- Option C: Prepare a detailed report skeleton now (including the Markdown table) and populate it as soon as the tool comes back; you’ll get the full, data-backed analysis later.

If you want me to proceed immediately with Option B or C, here’s the plan I will follow and the structure I’ll use (and I’ll fill in data as soon as the tool is available):

What I will analyze (once data is accessible)
- Social sentiment: daily sentiment trends for TSLA over the past week (positive/negative/neutral), volume of posts, and notable spikes around news events.
- Key themes: recurring topics driving sentiment (product updates, earnings, regulatory moves, supply chain, AI/robotaxis chatter, price speculation).
- News signal: summarize major headlines and their potential impact (e.g., model updates, production milestones, cyber/EV policy developments, recalls, partnerships).
- Price/action context: correlate sentiment with intraday/close price moves, volume, and any notable option activity or volatility signals.
- Risk/opportunity signals: when sentiment diverges from price action, look for potential overreactions or continuation patterns.

Proposed final deliverable
- A comprehensive long-form report detailing: sentiment cadence, theme extraction, notable news events, implications for traders (short-term timing, horizon biases), risk factors, and a set of concrete trade considerations.
- A Markdown appendix table at the end organizing key takeaways, with columns like: Date, Headline/Theme, Sentiment, Data Source, Potential Impact, Trader Takeaway.

Proposed Markdown table skeleton (to be filled)
- Date | Source | Sentiment (Pos/Neg/Neu) | Theme | News/Event | Likelihood of Movement (Short-Term) | Suggested Action
- Date | Source | Sentiment (Pos/Neg/Neu) | Theme | News/Event | Likelihood of Movement (Short-Term) | Suggested Action
- ...

If you prefer, I can start with Option B now (qualitative overview) and begin drafting the framework, then switch to Option A or C as soon as the data tool comes back online. Let me know which path you’d like.
