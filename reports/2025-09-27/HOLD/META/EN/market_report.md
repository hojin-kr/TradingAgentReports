Sorry—there was an issue fetching META data. The data pull returned a FileNotFoundError from the Yahoo Finance data tool. I can retry pulling the data now, or adjust the date window if you prefer. Please tell me if you want me to attempt another fetch (same window or a shorter window) and I’ll run it immediately.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators (8 total) that provide complementary insights for META and cover trend, momentum, and volatility without redundancy. Once the data fetch succeeds, I’ll generate a detailed, nuanced report with specific observations, cross-checks, and tradeable signals.

Selected indicators (8 total) and rationale
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to confirm ongoing trend when price is above/below the 50 SMA.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify golden/death cross contexts and overall regime (bullish/bearish). Reduces noise by confirming the larger trend.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts and can highlight potential entries when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd (MACD)
  - Why: Core momentum signal; crossovers indicate potential trend changes. Useful in combination with trend filters to avoid false signals in sideways markets.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Why: Smoother trend confirmation; MACD line cross with the Signal line provides a clearer signal when used with other indicators.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Why: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential early. Helps gauge the magnitude of momentum shifts and potential exhaustion.
- rsi (RSI)
  - Why: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and divergence signals. Complements trend indicators to flag potential reversals.
- atr (ATR)
  - Why: Volatility gauge for risk management; informs stop placement and position sizing. Provides context for ATR-based trailing stops and volatility regimes.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed narrative describing the current trend regime using the moving averages (50/200) and short-term momentum (10 EMA with MACD trio).
- Identification of MACD crossovers/divergences with RSI context to assess possible reversals versus continuation.
- Momentum strength assessment via MACD histogram and RSI levels, including any bullish/bearish divergences.
- Volatility context from ATR to tailor risk management (e.g., wider stops in high-volatility phases, tighter sizing in calmer periods).
- Any notable crossovers or alignments across indicators that signal high-probability entries or exits.
- A concise set of actionable signals (entry/exit/stop ideas) conditioned on the observed signals, with caveats for false positives in range-bound or choppy markets.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the key findings and indicator roles (as shown below).

Markdown table: Key indicators and their roles
| Indicator | Category | What it assesses | What to look for |
|-----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50 SMA; Crossover with price for support/resistance cues |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend and regime; trend confirmation | Price above/below 200 SMA; golden/death cross signals with other averages |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; alignment with longer-term trend strengthens signals |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend changes | MACD line crossing above/below zero; cross with MACDS for signals |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of momentum signal | MACD vs MACDS cross events; consistency with price action |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence | Increasing/decreasing histogram; potential divergences with price |
| rsi | RSI | Momentum magnitude and reversals | RSI values near overbought/oversold; divergences with price action |
| atr | ATR | Market volatility and risk management | Rising ATR suggests higher volatility; informs stop levels and sizing |

Next steps
- Please confirm if you’d like me to retry pulling METADATA for 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-27 (or suggest a shorter window, e.g., 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-27).
- Once I have the data, I’ll generate the full, nuanced report with observations, trend interpretations, and actionable signals, followed by the final table and a concise outlook.
