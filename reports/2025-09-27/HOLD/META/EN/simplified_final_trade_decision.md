# Investment Report: META
## Executive Summary
META runs social media and online ads. The stock is a Hold with a data-driven path to Buy only if non-ad monetization, AI revenue, and higher margins prove durable over several quarters. Near-term risks include ad-market cycles and regulatory costs.

## Investment Decision
Decision: Hold META now.
Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Growth potential exists if the UK ad-free option lifts margins and crossâ€‘geography monetization scales.
- AI-enabled engagement could create new ways to earn revenue and support higher long-run margins.
- Durable competitive advantages and capital returns support upside, but a clear, multi-quarter proof is needed before upgrading.
- Current valuation and near-term uncertainty justify a cautious stance rather than an immediate Buy.

## Risks To Watch
- Ad market cycles and regulatory costs could pressure margins and cash flow.
- Non-ad monetization may not scale as expected; AI ROI is still uncertain.
- Competition and a high price tag leave less room for error if monetization proves slower than hoped.
- Regulatory changes and cross-market challenges could affect profitability and timing of any upgrade.
