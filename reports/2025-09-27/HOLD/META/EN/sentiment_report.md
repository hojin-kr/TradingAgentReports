Thanks for trying. I attempted to fetch META Reddit stock data for 2025-09-27, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal backend issue). It looks like the data retrieval endpoint or file path it relies on is temporarily unavailable.

What I can do now
- I can retry the Reddit data pull immediately if you’d like.
- If you prefer, I can wait a bit and retry later to see if the backend issue resolves.
- If you have any alternative data sources you want me to use (e.g., other social platforms or specific Reddit threads you want monitored), you can share them and I’ll incorporate them.

What I’ll deliver once the data works
- A comprehensive long-form report analyzing social media sentiment and recent company news for META over the past week, with a focus on traders and investors.
- Components include:
  - Daily sentiment breakdown (positive, neutral, negative) and volume trends.
  - Key Reddit threads and notable sentiment drivers (e.g., product launches, AI announcements, regulatory/regulatory risk, earnings expectations, ad revenue concerns).
  - Cross-source synthesis: what people are saying on Reddit and how that compares to any fresh company news.
  - Event-driven analytics: mapping sentiment shifts to news/events during the period.
  - Sentiment-to-price implications (where data supports it) and potential catalysts.
  - Risk factors and caveats for traders (e.g., sentiment spikes vs. durable trend, potential for short squeezes, regulatory headwinds).
  - Actionable ideas for traders (short-term scalps vs. holds vs. longer-term positioning) with scenarios.
  - A final Markdown table organizing key points, dates, and drivers for quick reference.

If you’d like me to proceed with a retry now, say “retry now,” and I’ll attempt to fetch the data again immediately. If you’d rather wait, I’ll circle back as soon as the tool comes back online and deliver the full report.
