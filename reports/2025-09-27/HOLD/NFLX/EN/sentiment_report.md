I ran into an internal error when trying to fetch Reddit stock-news data for NFLX (FileNotFoundError) across the requested dates. I apologize for the hiccup. I can proceed in two ways:

- Option A: I wait and retry the Reddit data pull, then deliver a full, data-backed long report with day-by-day sentiment, recent news, and actionable trader insights.
- Option B: I provide a detailed, data-structure-ready framework now (without the Reddit data filled in yet), so you can review the approach and I can plug in the actual sentiment numbers as soon as the data tool is back up.

Here’s a comprehensive, ready-to-fill long-form NFLX report structure you can use now. It emphasizes social media sentiment, recent news, and implications for traders, with a clear plan for filling in data once the Reddit feed is accessible again.

NFLX Deep-Dive: Social Media Sentiment, News, and Trader Implications (Week of 2025-09-21 to 2025-09-27)

1) Executive snapshot (no data yet)
- Objective: Assess how Reddit and other social chatter, plus recent news, could influence NFLX’s momentum and potential trading opportunities over the past week.
- Status: Reddit data retrieval currently unavailable due to an internal tool error. Will update with day-by-day sentiment if the feed is restored. In the meantime, here is the analysis framework and the exact data to plug in.

2) Data sources and metrics (to fill once data is available)
- Reddit stock discussions: sentiment polarity, volume, post/comment counts, top threads by engagement, key theme tags (content slate, price changes, AR/MAU, password sharing, ads tier, gaming, international expansion).
- Public news feeds: notable Netflix announcements (content launches, price changes, earnings commentary, user growth or churn signals, regulatory or platform updates).
- Price context (optional, if you want to align sentiment with price moves): daily close, intraday moves, volatility.

3) Day-by-day sentiment framework (for 2025-09-27, 2025-09-26, 2025-09-25)
- How to present (for each date):
  - Sentiment score (aggregate from Reddit, expressed as positive/neutral/negative and a numeric index, e.g., -1 to +1 or -100 to +100).
  - Post volume: number of relevant NFLX mentions.
  - Top themes: 3–5 recurring topics in posts (e.g., “ad-supported tier performance,” “new content slate,” “password crackdown,” “global expansion,” “streaming competition”).
  - News anchors: any notable headlines on that date and their sentiment impact.
  - Price context: whether sentiment correlates with price action on that date (up, down, or mixed).
- Expected signals to watch:
  - Sharp spikes in volume with a shift toward negative sentiment could signal risk off or potential volatility.
  - Sustained positive sentiment around new content or favorable price increases could imply bullish momentum.
  - The emergence of fear/uncertainty themes (e.g., dissatisfaction with pricing, content delays) may precede swing moves.

4) Recent news signals to monitor (alignment with sentiment)
- Content slate and new releases: any announcements, trailers, or release dates that could drive user engagement and churn risk.
- Pricing and plan changes: any discussions or official notices about price increases, ad-supported tier performance, or bans on password sharing.
- International growth/turbulence: updates on markets outside the U.S. (subscription growth, regulatory headwinds, localized content strategy).
- Earnings-related context: if any earnings commentary or guidance was released in the week, summarize sentiment impact and subscriber/momentum implications.
- Competitive landscape: signals about Netflix’s standing versus peers (Disney+, Prime Video, etc.) that show up in social chatter.

5) Sentiment interpretation guide (how to translate data into trade thinking)
- Positive sentiment drivers:
  - Strong reception to new content slate, favorable view of pricing strategy, clear monetization improvements (e.g., ads tier growth with revenue efficiency).
  - Signals of continued subscriber growth or retention, especially in key markets.
- Negative sentiment drivers:
  - Content delays, cancellations, or disappointing premieres.
  - Negative reactions to price increases or perceived value declines.
  - Regulatory concerns in major markets or platform-related friction.
- Mixed/neutral signals:
  - High chatter without clear directional sentiment; potential for range-bound movement unless a concrete catalyst emerges.

6) Trading implications and scenarios
- Bullish scenario (positive sentiment + favorable news):
  - Near-term upside: potential breakouts on sentiment-driven rallies; look for confirmation with price action and volume surges.
  - Risk controls: tighten stops and watch for a pullback if the narrative shifts (e.g., mixed reviews or weak earnings guidance).
- Bearish scenario (negative sentiment + unfavorable news):
  - Near-term downside: potential gaps or accelerated declines on sentiment deterioration.
  - Risk controls: consider protective puts or hedges if price breaks key support, or reduce exposure until sentiment stabilizes.
- Neutral/unclear scenario:
  - Expect consolidation; wait for a decisive catalyst (a new content release or earnings commentary) to break out of the range.

7) Data gaps and next steps
- Once the Reddit data tool is fixed, I will fill:
  - Daily sentiment scores for 2025-09-27, 2025-09-26, 2025-09-25.
  - Daily post volumes and top themes.
  - Direct linkage between sentiment shifts and NFLX price action on those days.
  - A synthesized conclusion with recommended trader actions (e.g., entry/exit points, risk controls) based on the observed sentiment trajectory and news context.

8) Risk disclosures
- Sentiment data is indicative and not predictive; price movements can diverge due to macro factors, technicals, or undisclosed fundamentals.
- Reddit sentiment can be noisy and biased by active communities; corroborate with broader data (news, earnings, fundamentals).

If you’d like, I can proceed in one of two ways:
- Option A: I continue attempting to fetch the Reddit data now and deliver the full, data-filled long report as soon as the tool is reachable again.
- Option B: I finalize a data-agnostic version of this report immediately (using general NFLX context and typical sentiment drivers) and then plug in the exact numbers when the tool returns.

Please tell me which option you prefer, or if you want me to proceed with a different data source (if you have other sources you want me to include).
