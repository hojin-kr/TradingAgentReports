I attempted to fetch NFLX data and indicator reports, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like there’s a system-side issue fetching the CSV data right now. I can retry immediately or proceed with a plan and a best-practice indicator setup you can approve, after which I’ll run the data pull again and deliver a full, data-backed report as soon as the feed is restored.

Proposed indicator setup (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm the broader direction and potential support/resistance zones.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend; complements the 200 SMA by providing a more responsive trend signal and can highlight trend health vs. the 200 SMA.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum/price reaction gauge; reacts quickly to price changes and can flag early shifts when used with longer-term averages.
- macd: Momentum trend signal; crossovers and divergences help identify potential trend changes or continuations in conjunction with price structure.
- macds: MACD Signal; smoothing of MACD line; crossovers with MACD line provide additional confirmation to triggers.
- rsi: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold context; good for spotting potential reversals when paired with trend indicators.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA); baseline for volatility bands; useful for baseline price context and confirming breakouts/reversals with price action near bands.
- atr: Volatility/risk gauge; informs stop placement and position sizing relative to current market activity.

Why these are suitable for NFLX (current context)
- Netflix tends to exhibit multi-timeframe dynamics around earnings, content slate cycles, and subscriber guidance. A mix of trend (200/50 SMAs), short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD), momentum/overbought-oversold context (RSI), volatility context (ATR/Bollinger middle), and breakout signals (Bollinger bands) provides a well-rounded view without redundancy.
- The combination avoids over-reliance on a single signal type, reducing false positives in choppy periods while still offering timely entries when momentum aligns with a broader trend.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report describing the current state of NFLX across the chosen indicators.
- Fine-grained observations such as trend alignment across timeframes, momentum strength, potential momentum divergences, proximity to key moving averages, volatility regime, and potential breakout/return-to-mean scenarios.
- Practical trade considerations, including potential entry/exit signals, suggested stop levels using ATR, and risk management notes tailored to NFLX’s typical event-driven moves.

Next steps
- I can re-run the data pull immediately. If you’d like, I’ll retry NFLX data from 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-27 and then fetch the 8 indicators in parallel. If you prefer, I can try a narrower window or different date anchor.
- Once data is retrieved, I’ll produce:
  - A detailed narrative of trends, momentum, and volatility.
  - A concise action-oriented outlook (per the latest signals) without making an explicit buy/sell recommendation unless you ask for a final proposition.

Key indicators snapshot (selected indicators and what to look for)
- 200_sma: Is NFLX price below/above the 200-day trend line? A sustained move above may indicate a bullish regime; below may indicate bear or consolidation.
- 50_sma: Is price above or below the 50-day? Look for crossovers with price or with the 200 SMA to infer trend shifts.
- 10_ema: Any rapid price crosses above/below the 10-EMA could signal short-term momentum shifts; use with longer-term trend for confirmation.
- macd/macds: MACD cross above/below its signal line; convergence/divergence with price action; check for confirmation with RSI and price structure.
- rsi: Extreme readings (e.g., >70 or <30) and potential divergences with price action; check in the context of the prevailing trend signaled by SMAs.
- boll: Price action relative to the Bollinger middle line and bands; track breakouts, reversion to the mean, or band-riding in strong trends.
- atr: Current volatility regime; use to gauge stop distance and position sizing relative to recent price movement.

If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now and then return with the full, data-backed NFLX analysis using these 8 indicators. Would you like me to proceed with another data pull attempt?
