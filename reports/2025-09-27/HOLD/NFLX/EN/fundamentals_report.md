I attempted to fetch the NFLX fundamentals data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) for 2025-09-27, but all requests returned a FileNotFoundError in the data tools. Here are the exact messages I saw:

- Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')
  Please fix your mistakes.
- This repeated for each tool call (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement).

What this means
- The data backend or the specific data files required by the tools are currently unavailable or misconfigured in this environment. I can’t retrieve NFLX data right now.

Options to proceed
1) Retry now or after a short wait
   - I can retry the data fetches as soon as the tools are accessible again. If you’d like, I can attempt again with the same date (2025-09-27) or with a nearby date (e.g., 2025-09-20 or 2025-10-01) to see if the data stream resumes.

2) Proceed with a qualitative/structured report in parallel
   - I can draft a comprehensive fundamental-report framework for NFLX using what we would typically collect (company profile, high-level financial history structure, key ratios, and an insider sentiment/transactions section) and leave placeholders for the exact figures. You can then fill in or provide the data, and I’ll finalize the detailed analysis and the Markdown table.

3) Use alternative data sources you provide
   - If you can share the recent figures (even high-level numbers or PDFs), I can synthesize them into the full report and still append the required Markdown table at the end.

What I can deliver once data access is restored
- A thorough, trader-oriented fundamental report for NFLX covering:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Recent financial snapshot (from the latest quarterly/annual statements): revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, cash flow from operations, capex, free cash flow
  - Balance sheet snapshot: total assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity metrics (current ratio, quick ratio)
  - Income statement trend: revenue growth, margin trends, profitability drivers
  - Cash flow analysis: operating cash flow quality, investing/carrying flows, financing activities
  - Financial history and trend analysis: year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes, with commentary on drivers
  - Leverage and liquidity: debt levels, interest coverage, debt maturities (if available)
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days): tone, notable buys/sells, potential interpretation
  - Key risk factors and catalysts relevant to the period
  - A concise, trader-focused conclusion with implications for NFLX stock (e.g., potential entry/exit/hold considerations)
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points

If you’d like me to proceed now with a placeholder-based draft (no data yet) or retry the data fetch, please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry, I’ll attempt the tool calls again as soon as the backend is available.
