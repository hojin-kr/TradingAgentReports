Recommendation: Hold NVDA

Rationale (aligned with the investment plan you provided)
- Positive long-run thesis remains intact: durable AI data-center demand, strong CUDA/software moat, and robust balance sheet support upside.
- Near-term uncertainty remains material: AI capex cycles can soften, competition could pressure margins, regulatory/geopolitical risks loom, and near-term catalysts may not materialize as quickly as priced in.
- The current risk-reward favors risk management over aggressive buildup given potential volatility around policy headlines, supply-chain/ramp delays, and valuation sensitivity.

Actionable steps and guardrails
- Position sizing
  - If currently overweight NVDA, trim back to a balanced exposure (roughly 3–6% of portfolio for a single name), calibrating to overall risk tolerance.
  - If not overweight, avoid adding to NVDA now; maintain diversification within AI/tech exposure to reduce single-name risk.
- Hedging and cost-conscious risk management
  - Consider protective hedges to limit downside without capping upside: buy modest-depth puts (e.g., 5–15% OTM) with 1–3 quarters horizon, or implement a collar (long puts + short calls) to reduce net cost.
  - Use hedges to guard against headlines or weaker-than-expected data-center demand while preserving optionality.
- Catalysts and monitoring
  - Key triggers: OpenAI/hyperscaler capacity milestones, cadence of hyperscale capex, regulatory developments (export controls, antitrust, China exposure), and notable insider activity.
  - If catalysts strengthen meaningfully and policy risk stabilizes, reassess for a potential upgrade; if policy risk intensifies or execution delays surface, tighten hedges or trim further.
- Diversification and portfolio balance
  - Pair NVDA with less cyclically exposed AI/tech plays to dampen beta and reduce single-name risk.
- Review cadence
  - Establish a quarterly reassessment, with weekly monitoring around earnings/major announcements. If data-center demand and capacity ramps show clear, durable improvement with stable policy context, consider scaling into a gradual Buy tranche only then.

Bottom line
- Hold NVDA with a disciplined risk-management approach. This preserves upside optionality if catalysts materialize while protecting against near-term volatility and policy/regulatory headwinds.
