Given the investment plan you provided, my recommended stance is Path A: data-resilient bull thesis with hedges. In short: HOLD with a collar hedging overlay on QQQ.

Rationale
- Near-term uncertainty: Elevated macro sensitivity, data reliability concerns, and concentration risk in QQQ justify staying in the growth/tech exposure but with protection.
- Long-run thesis intact: AI/cloud growth, enterprise software, and mega-cap cash generation remain supportive of equities over a multi-quarter to multi-year horizon, barring a disorderly regime shift.
- Risk management priority: A collar limits downside if data signals worsen or macro conditions deteriorate, while preserving meaningful upside if broad breadth improves.

Strategic stance (Path A implementation)
- Core exposure: Maintain a 60–70% core exposure to QQQ (or equivalent growth proxy), calibrated to your risk tolerance.
- Hedging overlay (collar): 
  - Buy 1x QQQ put approximately 5–10% below the current price for downside protection.
  - Sell 1x QQQ call at a strike roughly 5–10% above the current price to fund the put.
  - Expected result: near-zero net premium, downside protection with a capped upside, aligning with a disciplined risk-management approach.
- Data-gap contingency: If data feeds remain unreliable for several trading days, avoid adding full long exposure until breadth and data reliability improve, and lean on fundamentals of top holdings and independent signals.
- Breadth monitoring: Weekly checks on breadth/leadership; if breadth broadens and leadership strengthens, allow gradual uptick in core exposure; if breadth narrows, consider tightening hedges or reducing core exposure.
- Time horizon and reassessment: Reassess in 1–3 months as data reliability returns and breadth signals clarify the regime.
- Risk controls: Maintain stop discipline for the core exposure and ensure hedges remain cost-efficient relative to protection.

Operational steps to execute now
- Place collar orders on QQQ with the described strike ranges (adjust to your exact entry price and risk tolerance).
- Set target core exposure at 60–70% of your growth allocation; hedges at 30–40% of exposure.
- Establish a data-gap alert protocol and a breadth dashboard; plan a review in one week and a deeper review in 2–3 weeks.
- Prepare a concise bear-counterpart note to stay prepared for regime shifts or shifting macro signals.

Learning and process discipline
- This approach prioritizes diversification of signals, manages concentration risk, and preserves optionality via hedges. It reflects a discipline to hedge data fragility and macro sensitivity while staying invested in the secular AI/cloud growth thesis.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
