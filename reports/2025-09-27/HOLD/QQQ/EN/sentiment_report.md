Thanks for the prompt. I’m running into a tool issue right now.

What happened
- The Reddit data fetch for QQQ on 2025-09-27 returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool error). I’ve retried twice, but the underlying tool doesn’t seem to be functioning at the moment. I can’t pull Reddit-specific sentiment data for today right this second.

What I can do now
- I can either:
  1) Retry the Reddit data pull again shortly and then compile the full long-form report with Reddit data as soon as the tool works, or
  2) Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using other public sentiment signals and recent news (i.e., non-Reddit sources like mainstream financial news, StockTwits/X chatter, general macro/tech news) and clearly mark data gaps until Reddit data is back.

If you’d like me to proceed now with option 2, I can deliver a comprehensive long report focused on QQQ (the Nasdaq-100 ETF) covering:
- Social sentiment themes from available non-Reddit sources over the past week
- Recent news headlines affecting tech/growth exposure and ETF flows
- Implications for traders (short-term swings, risk management, potential setups)
- A clear section on data gaps and what we’ll update once Reddit data is back
- A Makrmarkdown table at the end summarizing key points

Proposed plan for the report (pending Reddit data)
- Executive snapshot: Where sentiment and headlines hint at risk/urgency for QQQ over the last week.
- Daily sentiment sketch (qualitative): Major themes per day from non-Reddit sources, noting any spikes around macro events or tech earnings.
- News & catalysts: The top 5 news items affecting the Nasdaq-100/QQQ (AI buzz, policy/rate expectations, mega-cap earnings, geopolitical or supply-chain news, sector rotations).
- Sector/stock-flow context: Any observable ETF flows or proxy hedging signals that impact QQQ (without Reddit data, we’ll rely on alternative datasets and headlines).
- Risk and scenario analysis: Potential outcomes if rate expectations shift, technology leadership changes, or macro headlines shift, with likely impacts on QQQ.
- Trader implications: Short-term entry/exit ideas, watchouts for volatility, and risk controls.
- Makrmarkdown table: Key takeaways, catalysts, sentiment signal quality, and data gaps.

Before I proceed, please tell me which path you prefer:
- A) Retry the Reddit data fetch now and deliver the full Reddit-inclusive report as soon as it succeeds.
- B) Proceed with option 2 (non-Reddit, broad sentiment + news) and deliver the long-form report with a clear data-gap section.

If you choose A, I’ll keep trying and update you as soon as I get Reddit data. If you choose B, I’ll start immediately with a detailed non-Reddit sentiment and news analysis and clearly annotate where Reddit data would be plugged in once available.
