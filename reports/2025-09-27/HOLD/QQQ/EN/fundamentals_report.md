Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the data you requested, but the data tools returned a FileNotFoundError. Specifically, the parallel tool call failed for all four data requests, and a direct call to get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment also failed with the same error. I don’t have usable data to present from those calls right now.

Important note: QQQ is not a single company; it is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) that tracks the NASDAQ-100 index. As such, many of the “company-level” fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheets, income statements, cash flows) do not apply to QQQ itself. Those data points are relevant to individual issuers owned by QQQ (e.g., MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, etc.), but not to the ETF as a standalone entity.

Given that, here are the best ways we can proceed, with options to get you a rigorous, trader-focused view:

Plan A: ETF-level overview (no insider data)
- What we can cover now:
  - Fund profile: issuer, inception date, objective, and tracking methodology.
  - Holdings snapshot: concentration by top holdings and approximate weights (noting that weights change daily).
  - Sector allocation and geographic exposure (proxy risk profile).
  - Fees and liquidity: expense ratio, total assets under management (AUM), average daily trading volume, bid-ask spread considerations.
  - Performance context: benchmark tracking error, historical performance vs. NASDAQ-100 and relevant benchmarks, and potential drivers (tech leadership, mega-cap concentration, growth vs. value tilts).
  - Risk factors and catalysts: concentration risk in large tech names, reliance on US tech/growth, macro factors (rates, tech cap cycles), and potential portfolio rebalancing events.
  - Trader takeaway: how this ETF’s composition and structure may impact cash-flow, volatility, and macro exposure.

Plan B: Switch to a specific constituent (recommended for actionable fundamental analysis)
- We can analyze a major holding within QQQ (e.g., MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN) in depth using the provided data tools:
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions for the company (not ETF-level data).
  - Most recent quarterly balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statements.
  - Company-specific fundamentals, historical trend context, and implications for the stock’s risk/return.
  - How the stock’s fundamentals interact with the ETF’s overall composition (e.g., how a bullish/bearish view on MSFT or NVDA could shift ETF-level risk/return).

Plan C: Retry data retrieval
- I can retry the data calls for QQQ now or after a short interval. If you prefer, I can try a different ticker (e.g., MSFT) for the company-level analysis in the same report framework.

What would you like to do?
- Option 1: Proceed with Plan A (ETF-level comprehensive overview) and provide a structured ETF-focused report.
- Option 2: Proceed with Plan B (pick a top holding like MSFT or AAPL and generate a full fundamental report on that company, including insider sentiment/transactions and financials).
- Option 3: Retry fetching data for QQQ now and, if successful, proceed with Plan A plus plan for top holdings depending on data availability.
- Option 4: If you have a specific constituent you want analyzed (ticker of a top hold within QQQ), tell me and I’ll start there.

If you confirm Plan A or Plan B, I’ll deliver a detailed, trader-oriented report with thorough insights and a concluding, easy-to-scan summary table.
