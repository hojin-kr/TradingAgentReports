Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch data for QQQ and run the selected indicators, but the data retrieval service is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. In short, the issue isn’t with the ticker or strategy, but with the data source being unavailable or misconfigured in this environment right now. I’ll outline what happened, what I planned to run, and how we can proceed.

What happened
- Attempts to fetch price data for QQQ over a broad range (2023-09-27 to 2025-09-27, and variants) all failed with FileNotFoundError.
- Parallel indicator requests also failed for the same underlying data issue.
- As a result, I don’t have live data to compute the indicators or produce a current trend report.

What I propose to do once data access is restored
- Run the following 8 indicators (as requested, to provide complementary insights without redundancy):
  1) close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average) – to gauge medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
  2) close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average) – to confirm the long-term trend and watch for golden/death crosses.
  3) close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average) – to capture quick momentum shifts and potential entry signals.
  4) macd (MACD line) – to identify momentum changes and potential trend reversals via crossovers/divergence.
  5) macds (MACD Signal) – to trigger trades with MACD crossovers; helps reduce false positives when used with MACD.
  6) rsi (RSI) – to flag overbought/oversold conditions and look for divergences in the context of trend.
  7) boll (Bollinger Middle, 20-SMA) – to set a dynamic benchmark for price movement and gauge breakout/reversal context with bands.
  8) atr (Average True Range) – to understand current volatility for risk management and stop placement.

- Rationale for QQQ context
  - QQQ is heavily weighted toward tech and growth names; it often exhibits clear trend phases with persistent momentum during AI/tech cycles and sharp pullbacks during risk-off periods.
  - A combination of mid-term/long-term trend (50/200 SMA), quick momentum (10 EMA, MACD lines), momentum/volatility filters (RSI, ATR), and volatility-belt context (Bollinger middle) provides a well-rounded view without overlapping signals.
  - This suite helps to confirm signals across multiple timeframes and regimes (trending vs. ranging), which is particularly valuable for an ETF that can swing on tech sentiment, macro news, and earnings outcomes.

What you can do now to help me move forward
- If you can re-run the data fetch in a moment (or provide access to an alternate data source in this environment), I’ll immediately:
  - Retrieve the data for QQQ for a suitable window (e.g., last 1 year to 2 years).
  - Compute the 8 indicators listed above.
  - Produce a detailed, nuanced trend report with context-specific insights and actionable takeaways.
  - Append a Markdown table at the end summarizing key points.

Proposed alternative (if data access remains unavailable)
- I can provide a detailed framework and interpretation guide using hypothetical or historical reference values, but I won’t fabricate fresh data. If you’re okay with that, I’ll:
  - Outline how to interpret each indicator in typical QQQ scenarios (e.g., what a MACD bullish crossover alongside a price above 50-SMA and RSI in the 50–70 range might imply).
  - Suggest concrete entries/exits rules based on these indicators (e.g., EMA cross with price above 50-SMA and ATR-based stop).
  - Provide a generic decision matrix you can apply once data is available.

Next steps I’ll take as soon as data access is restored
- Re-run data retrieval for QQQ (date range of your choice, e.g., last 1–2 years).
- Compute the 8 indicators listed above.
- Deliver a detailed, granular report including:
  - Trend direction (short/medium/long-term) and strength
  - Momentum signals and potential reversals
  - Volatility context and risk management considerations
  - Scenario-based trade ideas (with caveats)
  - A clear Markdown table of key points

Proposed final deliverable structure (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: Overall trend and key risk/entry cues
- Indicator-by-indicator analysis: What each signal is saying now, with cross-checks
- Contextual narrative: How macro/tech sentiment may influence QQQ in the near term
- Trade considerations: Potential entry/exit zones, stop placement guided by ATR, and risk controls
- Caveats: What could invalidate signals (earnings surprises, macro shocks, regime shifts)
- Markdown table summarizing: Indicator, Current Read, Signal Type, Confidence, Notes

Markdown table (example format to be filled with actual data)
- Indicator | Current Read | Signal/Action | Confidence | Notes
- close_50_sma | Pending | Pending | Pending | Medium-term trend context
- close_200_sma | Pending | Pending | Pending | Long-term trend context
- close_10_ema | Pending | Pending | Pending | Short-term momentum
- macd | Pending | Pending | Pending | Momentum trend changes
- macds | Pending | Pending | Pending | MACD signal confirmation
- rsi | Pending | Pending | Pending | Momentum overbought/oversold context
- boll | Pending | Pending | Pending | Price position relative to middle band
- atr | Pending | Pending | Pending | Current volatility level

Apologies for the interruption. If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch immediately or switch to a narrower date range to increase the likelihood of a successful run. How would you like to proceed?
