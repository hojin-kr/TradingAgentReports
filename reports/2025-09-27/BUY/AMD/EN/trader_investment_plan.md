Here is a concrete AMD entry plan aligned to the bullish thesis you provided, with explicit entry points, risk controls, and an options hedge structure. If you share your portfolio size and current price, I can tailor exact share counts and precise option strikes.

1) Position sizing (example framework)
- Target AMD exposure: 3–5% of your growth sleeve (adjust to your risk tolerance).
- If your growth sleeve is, for example, $100k, target AMD allocation roughly $3k–$5k initially, with the ability to scale up to approximately $6k–$10k as signals confirm.
- Phase-based approach helps manage volatility and data gaps.

2) Phase 1 – Initial entry (Today)
- Action: Buy an initial tranche of roughly 1/3 of your intended AMD shares at market or near-market with a limit slightly inside the bid/ask to avoid chasing.
- Rationale: Establish base exposure while awaiting confirmation signals.
- Trigger for peace of mind: Price trading above the 50-day moving average with constructive volume. If price is currently near support and you’re comfortable, place a limit near the current price to avoid extended slippage.

3) Phase 2 – Add-on on pullback or breakout confirmation
- Condition A (pullback add-on): If AMD trades down 5–10% intraday from Phase 1 fill price or tests the 50-day MA with higher-than-average volume, add another 1/3 of the planned shares.
- Condition B (breakout add-on): If price closes above both the 50-day MA and the 20-day MA for 2–3 consecutive days with rising volume, add another 1/3.
- Rationale: Captures downside protection during near-term volatility and leverages momentum when trend is confirmed.

4) Phase 3 – Finalize full position on sustained trend
- Condition: Clear multi-week uptrend signals (price remains above major trendlines, MACD bullish cross, and RSI not in overbought extreme) and stronger data signals (ROCm GAIA adoption progress, bookings/MCPU ramp).
- Action: If Phase 1 and Phase 2 signals are satisfied, complete the remaining shares to reach the target AMD exposure.

5) Stop loss and risk controls
- Trailing stop: Implement a 15–20% trailing stop from the average entry price to protect downside while allowing upside room.
- Alternative stop: A close below the 200-day moving average for 2 consecutive days triggers a partial trim or halt of further adds.
- Diversification guard: Do not let AMD exceed your defined growth sleeve allocation; rebalance if it breaches your target range.

6) Hedging and options structure (to protect downside while retaining upside)
- Collar strategy (recommended for cost efficiency):
  - Long put: Buy a long-dated, out-of-the-money put option (9–12 months) with a strike roughly 10–15% below the current price to provide downside protection.
  - Short call: Sell a mid-to-out-of-the-money call option (same expiration or slightly shorter) to finance the put purchase. Choose a strike above the current price to allow upside participation.
  - Outcome: Defined downside limit with capped upside, typically at no net premium if the short call premium offsets the put cost.
- Alternative hedges (if you want more upside participation):
  - Long-dated protective puts only (e.g., 9–12 months out) at 10–15% OTM, paired with a small core position of AMD shares.
  - Or a 6–9 month put spread (long 1x 10–15% OTM, short 1x 0–5% OTM) to reduce cost while providing a buffer.
- If you prefer not to hedge with options: implement a robust stop strategy (trailing stop) and rely on the staged entry to limit risk.

7) Catalysts and monitoring framework
- Key signals to monitor: ROCm GAIA adoption milestones, enterprise/customer deals (Cohere, Tech Mahindra references), ZT/Sanmina transition progress and margin implications, AI workload backlog, and data-center capex trends from hyperscalers.
- Technical checks: price action above 50-day and 200-day MA, MACD bullish momentum, RSI in a healthy range (not overbought), and volume patterns confirming trend.

8) Timeline and milestones (high level)
- 0–3 months: Establish core position; watch for data flow on margins and backlog progress; use Phase 2 triggers to adjust exposure.
- 3–6 months: Look for clearer AI demand signals and margin improvements; consider additional adds if data remains constructive.
- 6–12 months: Seek durable data-center ramp, software ecosystem traction, and margin expansion translating into cash-flow signals; adjust position size accordingly.

9) How I’ll adapt if data is incomplete
- If bookings/margin signals remain murky, lean toward the staged-entry approach with tighter stops and a lighter overall AMD exposure.
- If bear arguments intensify (execution risk, geopolitics, or demand softness) but price action remains constructive, rely on hedges and a more conservative add-on cadence.

Would you like me to tailor the exact numbers to your portfolio by sharing:
- Your total portfolio size
- The portion you’re willing to allocate to AMD (in dollars or percentage)
- Your preferred risk appetite (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
- Your current AMD price and the option expiration horizon you’re comfortable with?

If you provide those details, I’ll calculate precise share counts for Phase 1–3, recommended stop levels, and a concrete collar/hard-hedge option structure with exact strikes and expirations.

Final check: Based on the plan and the price-action/monetary dynamics described, the recommended stance is a measured Buy with staged entry and hedging to manage risk.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
