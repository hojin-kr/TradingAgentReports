I attempted to pull AMD data and compute the requested indicators, but the data fetch failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the data source. I can retry the fetch, or we can proceed with a qualitative framework now and run the calculations as soon as the data source is reachable. In the meantime, here is a carefully considered set of indicators (up to 8) that would give complementary, non-redundant insights for AMD's current context, along with how I’d interpret them once the data is available.

Selected indicators and rationale (8 indicators, non-redundant)

1) close_10_ema (Moving Averages - short-term)
- Purpose: Capture quick momentum shifts and potential entry points; responsive to recent price action.
- Why useful for AMD: AMD often experiences rapid moves around earnings and AI demand cycles; a short-term ema can help identify early momentum changes before longer-term trends are fully in place.
- How to use: Look for crossovers with price or with a longer-term average (e.g., price crossing above the 10 EMA) to flag potential entries, then confirm with MACD and RSI.

2) close_50_sma (Moving Averages - mid-term)
- Purpose: Identify the intermediate trend and provide a dynamic support/resistance level.
- Why useful for AMD: Helps filter noise from the choppier near-term moves and aligns with broader trend direction.
- How to use: Confirm that price is above/below the 50 SMA for bias; look for confluence with MACD to validate a move.

3) close_200_sma (Moving Averages - long-term)
- Purpose: Establish the overall long-term trend and potential golden/death cross signals.
- Why useful for AMD: Acts as a major reference for trend health and strategic positioning.
- How to use: Use crossovers (price or 10/50 SMA relative to 200 SMA) to gauge major regime changes; require MACD strength and RSI alignment for entries.

4) macd (MACD)
- Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals via the difference between two EMAs.
- Why useful for AMD: AMD’s moves are often driven by shifts in momentum around product launches, AI cycles, and demand trends.
- How to use: Look for MACD line crossovers with the signal line, centerline crossings, and divergence with price to confirm breakouts or reversals; corroborate with RSI and price above key moving averages.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- Purpose: Smoothing of MACD to trigger trades with a more robust signal.
- Why useful for AMD: Helps reduce false entries in choppy markets; provides a more reliable trigger when used with MACD and price/MA context.
- How to use: Use MACD vs MACD Signal crossovers in combination with price position relative to 50/200 SMA and RSI levels.

6) rsi (RSI)
- Purpose: Momentum gauge and overbought/oversold context.
- Why useful for AMD: In strong uptrends RSI can linger in overbought territory; in corrections RSI can show early signs of reversal or continued momentum if it remains neutral within a trend.
- How to use: Watch for classic 70/30 levels, but prioritize divergence signals or conflicts with moving average trend (e.g., RSI overbought while price remains below a rising 50/200 SMA could indicate fading momentum).

7) atr (Average True Range)
- Purpose: Measure of current volatility and a guide for risk management.
- Why useful for AMD: Volatility can spike around earnings, product cycles, and market shifts; ATR helps tailor stop-loss placement and position sizing.
- How to use: Use rising ATR signals to widen stops/adjust risk; use ATR to normalize risk per trade in a trend-following setup.

8) vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
- Purpose: Trend confirmation with volume; price action filtered by where the most trading activity occurred.
- Why useful for AMD: Volume spikes can accompany major moves, and VWMA helps confirm the strength of price moves with participation.
- How to use: Confirm trend direction when price trades above/below VWMA with strong volume; look for volume-supported breakouts rather than price-only moves.

Notes on interpretation and trading framework (once data is available)

- Trend confirmation: Prioritize alignment across multiple timeframes/indicators. For example, price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with MACD bullish, RSI above midline but not in overbought extremes, and VWMA confirming with higher volume, suggests a higher-probability up move.
- Momentum vs volatility: Use MACD (and MACD Signal) to gauge momentum shifts, while ATR informs risk sizing. A rising ATR with a bullish MACD and price above key moving averages supports potential continuation, but with widened stop loss to account for increased volatility.
- Reversals and risk: In cases where RSI shows overbought conditions while price is extended above long-term moving averages, wait for MACD hesitation or bearish divergence to add caution; consider tightening stops or reducing size if ATR is telling you volatility is rising without clear price acceleration.
- Earnings/Events context: AMD often moves on earnings or product-cycle news. In such periods, rely more on MACD light confirmations, VWMA with volume spikes, and a disciplined risk framework (ATR-based stops) to avoid overexposure to binary events.
- Redundancy avoidance: The chosen set covers trend (short/medium/long via 10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA), momentum (MACD family and RSI), volatility (ATR), and volume-driven confirmation (VWMA). This reduces overlap and provides a well-rounded view.

Next steps to proceed

- If you’d like, I can re-run the data fetch now and compute the 8 indicators exactly as listed. Please confirm you want me to retry the data pull for AMD from 2024-09-27 to 2025-09-27, and I’ll report back with the data-driven analysis.
- If you prefer moving forward immediately, I can deliver a purely rule-based decision framework using these indicators as if they were available, or I can analyze AMD on a qualitative basis using recent known fundamentals (earnings cadence, AI product cycles) without the exact indicator values.

Appendix — Key points at a glance (Markdown table)

| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for AMD |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Moving Average (short-term) | Short-term momentum; responsiveness to price moves | Entry timing: price crossing above 10 EMA; confirm with MACD and RSI |
| close_50_sma | Moving Average (mid-term) | Intermediate trend; dynamic support/resistance | Bias when price stays above/below 50 SMA; cross with MACD for signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average (long-term) | Long-term trend; golden/death cross context | Trend confirmation; use for strategic positioning; require momentum confirmation |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend-change signals | Crossovers vs signal line; diverges with price for early trend changes; confirm with RSI/MA context |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothed MACD momentum | Use with MACD line cross; reduces false signals; align with price/MA context |
| rsi | RSI | Momentum, overbought/oversold context | 30/70 thresholds; watch for divergences; in strong trends, interpret cautiously with trend direction |
| atr | ATR | Market volatility; stop levels and risk sizing | Higher ATR means wider stops; adjust position size accordingly; use with risk rules |
| vwma | Volume-Weighted MA | Trend + volume confirmation | Confirm moves with volume; prefer breakouts with volume support; use for trail in trend |

Request: Please tell me if you’d like me to retry the data pull now, or if you prefer I proceed with the qualitative, rules-based analysis using these indicators as a framework. I’ll adapt immediately once the data retrieval succeeds.
