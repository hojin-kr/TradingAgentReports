Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for AMD across multiple dates (2025-09-27 to 2025-09-21) using the provided get_reddit_stock_info tool, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError consistently. It looks like the data retrieval endpoint is currently unavailable or misconfigured. I also tried a single call for 2025-09-27, and it failed with the same error. Until the tool is fixed, I can’t pull the day-by-day Reddit sentiment signals directly.

What I can do now
- Retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is back online or after a short delay.
- If you’d like, switch to alternative sentiment sources (these can be integrated in parallel or as a fallback):
  - Twitter/X sentiment (AMD-related mentions, sentiment polarity, volume)
  - StockTwits discussions
  - Reddit (via public web sources) cross-checked with other aggregators
  - News sentiment: headline tone from reputable outlets and kit-of-news summaries
  - Options activity signals (put/call ratios) to gauge sentiment and positioning
- Proceed with a thorough qualitative analysis using available public information (earnings cadence, product cycles, supply/demand signals, competitive landscape) and outline implications for traders, while clearly marking data gaps until Reddit sentiment data is restored.

Proposed structure for the long-form report (to be filled once data sources are available)
- Executive snapshot
  - Summary of current sentiment posture (aggregate across sources) and how it compares to price action.
  - Key catalysts in the last week (news, earnings cadence, product announcements, supply chain updates).
- Social sentiment overview
  - Overall sentiment trend (positive/neutral/negative) across sources.
  - Day-by-day sentiment deltas (incremental increases/decreases) and notable spikes tied to specific events.
- Reddit-focused themes (when available)
  - Frequent topics (AI compute demand, GPUs, data center demand, supply chain, pricing, partnerships).
  - Prominent sentiment drivers (e.g., “bullish on AI acceleration,” “concerns about margins”).
  - Post volume vs. price action correlations.
- News roundup (last 7 days)
  - Headlines and tone (positive, neutral, negative) with brief summaries.
  - Any major catalysts (earnings, guidance changes, partnerships, competitive moves).
- Quantitative sentiment cues
  - Volume and velocity of mentions
  - Net sentiment score (positive minus negative) and its volatility
  - Any divergence between sentiment and actual price movement (e.g., rising sentiment while price weakens)
- Trading implications and scenarios
  - Base case, bull case, bear case with trigger events
  - Key levels to watch (support/resistance, moving averages)
  - Risk factors to monitor (AI demand surprises, supply issues, competitive dynamics)
- Key risks and considerations
  - Data gaps due to source outages
  - Model/aggregation biases in social sentiment
- Summary of actionable takeaways for traders

Suggested Markdown table template (fill after data is available)
- This table helps distill daily sentiment and catalysts into a compact view.

Next steps
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit sentiment fetch now (assuming the tool comes back online shortly)?
- Or would you prefer I switch to assembling the report from alternative sentiment sources right away and clearly label any data gaps from Reddit?
- If you have any preferences for specific sources (e.g., prioritize Reddit over Twitter, or vice versa), tell me and I’ll weight them accordingly.

Once the data tooling is functioning again, I will deliver a comprehensive, fine-grained AMD sentiment and news report with a filled-in daily sentiment table, detailed insights, risk factors, and trading implications, plus the final Markdown table of key takeaways.
