I attempted to pull the latest Reddit stock news for PLTR on 2025-09-27, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source is temporarily unavailable on my end.

I can proceed in one of two ways, you choose which you prefer:
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data pull now and build the full report as soon as I have that sentiment data.
- Option B: Skip Reddit for now and proceed with a thorough qualitative analysis using other public sources (official news, general sentiment on social media, earnings/PR notes, etc.) once you authorize me to fetch them.

Here’s the plan for a comprehensive long report once we have data (whichever path you choose):

1) Executive snapshot (today)
- Quick sentiment view (positive/negative/neutral) if data available
- Key catalysts in the last 7 days (news, product announcements, partnerships, regulatory items)
- Price action and notable volume changes around those catalysts

2) Daily sentiment trend (past 7–14 days)
- Day-by-day sentiment scores and notable swings
- Top themes driving sentiment (e.g., product adoption, government contracts, AI capabilities, competition)
- Any outsized social media posts or threads that correlate with price moves

3) Social/media signal deep dive
- Breakdown of top posts by sentiment, engagement, and sentiment shift
- Notable recurring topics (e.g., Foundry platform discussions, user adoption signals, complaints or concerns)
- Any influencer or community-driven narratives impacting perception

4) News and event framing (past week)
- Summary of major company news (earnings, product launches, partnerships, government/industry news)
- External factors (macro AI sector sentiment, policy or regulatory chatter) that could affect PLTR
- Implications of each item for near-term price movement and risk

5) Flagged risks and opportunities
- Bearish risk signals (negative press, delayed catalysts, execution concerns)
- Bullish catalysts (contract wins, large deployments, favorable analyst notes)
- Liquidity, option activity, and potential short-term squeezes or pullbacks

6) Trader-focused takeaways
- Short-term scenario analysis with plausible price ranges under different catalysts
- Tactical trade ideas (entry/exit considerations) aligned with catalysts and sentiment shifts
- Risk management notes (stop levels, position sizing guidance)

7) Data sources and methodology
- What sources were used (Reddit, major news, company announcements, etc.)
- How sentiment is quantified and any limitations

8) Appendices
- Data snippets, notable headlines, and any graphs or charts (as available)

Proposed Markdown table (key points to organize at the end)
- Date
- Positive Sentiment %
- Negative Sentiment %
- Neutral Sentiment %
- Top Theme(s)
- Major News Headline
- Price Move (intraday/close)
- Volume Change (%)
- Catalyst/Notes

If you want me to proceed now, please confirm:
- Option A (Retry Reddit data pull now) or
- Option B (Proceed with alternative sources and a best-effort sentiment/news report without Reddit data)

Once I have the go-ahead, I’ll assemble the long-form report and include the Markdown table with the key points.
