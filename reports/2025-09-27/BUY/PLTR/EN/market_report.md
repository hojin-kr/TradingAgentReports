I tried to fetch PLTR data for you, but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError). I can’t generate live indicator values without the data feed. I can still propose a solid, non-redundant set of indicators you can apply to PLTR (Palantir Technologies) and explain how to use them together once the data is available. If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now or on your cue.

Recommended indicator set for PLTR (up to 8 indicators, diverse and complementary)

1) close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average)
- What it tells you: Mid-term trend direction and potential dynamic support/resistance.
- How to use: If price sits above 50SMA, bias is bullish; if below, bias is bearish. Use crossovers with price or other moving averages as a signal filter.

2) close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average)
- What it tells you: Long-term trend context and major support/resistance level.
- How to use: Look for trend confirmation against the 200SMA (price above indicates long-term uptrend, below indicates downtrend). Golden/death cross with 50SMA can add context for strategic positioning.

3) close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average)
- What it tells you: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action.
- How to use: Use as a fast signal line in conjunction with longer-term averages to identify early entries or exits; be mindful of noise in choppy markets.

4) macd (MACD)
- What it tells you: Momentum and potential trend changes via the difference between two EMAs.
- How to use: Watch for MACD line crossing the MACD signal line, and note divergences from price action as warning signs of weakening momentum.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- What it tells you: Smoothed momentum signal for crossovers with MACD line.
- How to use: Use MACD vs MACDS crossovers to confirm entries/exits; avoid trades on MACD alone, especially in range-bound markets.

6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
- What it tells you: Momentum strength and potential divergence in a visual form.
- How to use: Growing histogram suggests strengthening momentum; shrinking histogram hints at momentum fading. Divergence between histogram and price can precede trend changes.

7) rsi (RSI)
- What it tells you: Relative momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
- How to use: Common thresholds: >70 overbought, <30 oversold. Look for reversals or divergences with price; in strong trends, RSI can stay extended, so cross-check with trend indicators (50/200 SMA, MACD).

8) boll (Bollinger Middle)
- What it tells you: The 20-period SMA used as a dynamic baseline for price deviations.
- How to use: Pair with Bollinger Upper/Lower bands to identify breakout zones or reversals. Price testing the middle line can indicate consolidation or a bounce/reversion zone; bands help gauge volatility and potential breakout levels when price moves beyond the bands.

How to use these together (synthetic workflow for PLTR)
- Establish the trend: Confirm with 50SMA and 200SMA. Price above both and 50SMA above 200SMA suggests a bullish context; price below both and 50SMA below 200SMA suggests bearish context.
- Confirm momentum shifts: Use MACD, MACDS, and MACDH together. A bullish setup would be MACD crossing above MACDS with a widening MACDH; bearish setups show the opposite.
- Add short-term timing: Use 10EMA in conjunction with MACD signals to improve entry timing, while RSI helps avoid buying into overbought zones in uptrends or selling into oversold zones in downtrends.
- Validate volatility and breakout risk: Use boll (middle) with the bands (if you later decide to include boll_ub and boll_lb) to gauge how far price may extend and to avoid premature entries in high-volatility days.
- Risk filters: Use RSI and price location relative to 50SMA/200SMA as a guardrail. If price is below 200SMA but RSI is oversold with MACD showing negative momentum, wait for confirmation before considering a short entry.

Notes on market context for PLTR
- PLTR has exhibited periods of high volatility with rapid shifts between risk-on and risk-off narratives. Pairing a stable trend framework (50SMA/200SMA) with momentum signals (MACD family) and a momentum/volatility read (RSI and Bollinger middle) helps balance opportunity and risk.
- In range-bound phases, MACD signals may produce false positives; rely more on price position relative to major moving averages and Bollinger context.
- In trending phases, expect price to respect the 200SMA for longer periods; use MACD/HIST to time entries as momentum strengthens or weakens.

Next steps
- I can re-run the data fetch for PLTR and then generate a live indicator report using these eight indicators, including current values, signals, and a more precise, trade-ready interpretation.
- If you want, specify a date range or a specific trading window (e.g., intraday, daily, or weekly) to tailor the analysis.

Key points table (indicator overview)

| Indicator | Category | Purpose / What it measures | How to use (quick guide) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below indicates bias; watch crossovers with price for signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend context and major support/resistance | Trend confirmation; golden/death cross context with other signals |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum and quick price shifts | Fast entry/exit signals; use with longer averages to filter noise |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend-change potential (MACD line vs signal) | Crossovers signal momentum shifts; confirm with other indicators |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothed momentum signal for crossovers | Use with MACD to confirm entries/exits; reduces false positives |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence visualization | Growing vs shrinking momentum; watch for price-mom divergence |
| rsi | Momentum (RSI) | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions | Thresholds (70/30) and divergences; cross-check with trend |
| boll | Volatility Baseline (Bollinger Middle) | Dynamic baseline for price deviations and volatility context | Use with bands to spot breakouts/reversals and gauge volatility |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching PLTR data now and then produce a concrete, data-driven indicator report using these eight indicators. Just say “retry data fetch” and I’ll proceed.
