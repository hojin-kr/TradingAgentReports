Thanks for the patience. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit sentiment for AAPL (2025-09-27) but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data pull right away, or proceed with a best-effort analysis using the other information I can access (and clearly note the limitation about Reddit data for today).

Options:
- Retry now: I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again and then deliver the full long-form report with daily sentiment, key threads, and news analysis, plus a Markdown table at the end.
- Proceed without today’s Reddit data: I’ll provide a comprehensive sentiment+news framework based on available signals (macro trends, general social sentiment, and latest public news). I’ll flag where Reddit-specific data is missing and what to expect once the tool is back online.

If you’d like me to retry, I’ll proceed immediately. If you’d prefer me to proceed with the broader analysis now, I’ll start assembling a detailed report structure and fill in what I can.
