Thanks for your patience. I attempted to fetch AAPL data and compute the indicators, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError. I’m seeing a temporary data backend issue, so I can’t load the CSV or compute the indicators right now. I can retry immediately, or we can proceed with a clearly structured plan and wait for the data to come through. Please tell me which you prefer:
- Retry data fetch now
- Proceed with a qualitative indicator plan and decision framework while waiting for data

In the meantime, here is a concise, well-structured plan and the 8 indicators I’ll use (once data is available). These selections are chosen to provide complementary, non-redundant insights for AAPL over a one-year horizon (2024-09-27 to 2025-09-27 context). I’ll explain why each is suitable and how I’ll interpret them together.

Selected indicators (up to 8) and rationale:
- close_50_sma
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify the prevailing trend and potential pullbacks to a known moving average.
  - How to use: Price above 50SMA suggests bullish tilt; price below suggests bearish tilt. Look for crossovers or confluence with other signals for entries/exits.

- close_200_sma
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming the overarching market regime (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) and spotting golden/death cross signals.
  - How to use: Alignment with 50SMA and price above/below 200SMA strengthens the directional bias. Crossovers with 50SMA add timing context.

- close_10_ema
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum indicator. Captures quicker shifts that may precede longer-term moves.
  - How to use: Short-term momentum signals (price crossing 10-EMA, or price + momentum divergence) can precede moves that align with longer-term trends.

- macd
  - Why: Core momentum measure using EMA differences. Useful for trend-change signals and confirmation of strength.
  - How to use: Breakouts or crossovers above/below the MACD line, especially when aligned with price and moving averages, strengthen entries/exits.

- macds
  - Why: MACD Signal line smoothing for more tradable cross signals. Reduces false positives from MACD alone.
  - How to use: MACD crossing the MACD Signal line provides a trigger that should be confirmed with price and other indicators.

- macdh
  - Why: MACD Histogram shows momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than price moves.
  - How to use: Widening histogram confirms momentum; shrinking or negative histogram can warn of a weakening move or potential reversal when combined with other signals.

- rsi
  - Why: Momentum/overbought-oversold context. Helps identify potential reversals or continuation within extents of a trend.
  - How to use: Watch for overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) readings and divergences with price; confirm with trend direction from MA signals and MACD.

- vwma
  - Why: Volume-confirmed trend, blending price action with volume. Helps separate price moves backed by participation from moves on low volume.
  - How to use: If price advances with rising VWMA, it supports the validity of the move; a move on light volume may indicate a weaker signal.

Optional but considered (if you prefer a slightly different tilt, we can swap one):
- atr
  - Why: Volatility gauge to inform risk management and position sizing. Helps set stops and adapt to changing market conditions.
  - How to use: Rising ATR signals higher volatility; use to adjust stops and position sizing in line with market conditions.

How I’ll interpret these together (trading framework, once data is available):
- Trend alignment check: Confirm price position relative to 50SMA and 200SMA. A bullish setup generally requires price above both, with 50SMA above 200SMA (golden cross) as a strong bullish signal. Bearish alignment would be the reverse.
- Momentum confirmation: Look for MACD (and MACD Signal) direction in the same sense as the price trend. MACD histogram (macdh) helps gauge strength and potential divergences.
- Entry/exit triggers: Combine short-term momentum (10 EMA) with MACD crossovers and RSI position. For example, a bullish entry might be supported by price above 50SMA, MACD bullish crossover, RSI trending above 50 but not overbought, and VWMA confirming volume.
- Risk controls: Use ATR to set dynamic stops; higher ATR implies wider stops; lower ATR implies tighter stops. VWMA helps avoid trading on momentum with weak volume.
- Scenario guidance (without asserting any single current setup): 
  - Bullish scenario: Price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD above signal, MACD histogram positive, RSI not overbought, VWMA rising with price, ATR showing manageable volatility.
  - Bearish scenario: Price below 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD below signal, MACD histogram negative, RSI trending toward oversold with possible divergence, VWMA declining.
  - Neutral/range: Prices oscillating around moving averages, MACD and RSI showing mixed signals, ATR low-to-moderate, VWMA flat.

Proposed output structure once data loads:
- A detailed narrative describing the current alignment across the chosen indicators.
- A section on potential trades with candidate entry/exit rules, stop levels (using ATR), and risk considerations.
- A concise set of takeaways and a short list of conditions that would trigger a trade or a close/partial exit.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now or proceed with the plan above and provide a qualitative framework while data retrieval is retried? If you want me to retry, I’ll attempt the data fetch again immediately and then run the eight indicators once the CSV is available.
