I ran into an issue fetching NFLX data from the Yahoo Finance backend (FileNotFoundError). The data retrieval tool is currently not returning data, so I can’t generate the indicator readings right this moment. I can retry in a bit or proceed with a detailed plan and the chosen indicators so we’re ready to compute once the data connection is restored. Let me know if you’d like me to retry immediately; otherwise I’ll proceed with the strategic analysis framework using the selected indicators.

What I plan to use (up to 8 complementary indicators) for NFLX
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps confirm medium-term trend.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; useful for major trend confirmation and golden/death cross context.
- close_10_ema: 10-period exponential moving average. Captures quick momentum shifts; useful for early entries when paired with longer-term filters.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum trend indicator; crossovers signal potential trend changes.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoother trigger line; MACD vs MACD Signal cross provides another entry/exit filter.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions; watch for divergences and extremes.
- atr: ATR. Volatility gauge; informs stop placement and position sizing based on current volatility.
- vwma: VWMA. Volume-weighted trend confirmation; helps validate price action with volume dynamics.

Why these are suitable for NFLX right now
- NFLX tends to swing with both macro-driven risk and company-specific catalysts (earnings, content strategy, subscriber trends). The mix above gives:
  - Trend confirmation (50/200 SMA) and early momentum signals (10 EMA with MACD family).
  - Momentum quality and potential reversals (RSI).
  - Volatility awareness for risk controls (ATR).
  - Volume-supported trend validation (VWMA) to avoid false alignments in low-volume moves.
- This combination avoids over-reliance on a single indicator family (e.g., only MACD or only RSI) and provides cross-checks across price action, momentum, and volatility.

Next steps (once data retrieval works)
- Retrieve NFLX price data for the chosen window and compute the 8 indicators.
- Produce a detailed narrative with:
  - Trend analysis: price relative to the 50/200 SMA, crossovers, and the position of the price to the SMAs.
  - Momentum signals: MACD crossovers, MACD vs signal, RSI levels and divergences.
  - Volatility and risk framing: current ATR level and implications for stop placement.
  - Volume-confirmed trend: VWMA alignment with price action.
  - Practical trading scenarios: entry/exit angles, stop-loss placements using ATR, and risk-reward considerations.
- Provide a concise verdict (HOLD with a bias toward BUY or SELL when signals align) only after data is available.

Draft quick reference table of indicators and their key roles
| Indicator | Category | What it tells you | How it helps NFLX decisions |

| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; major support/resistance | Adds strategic trend confirmation; watch for golden/death cross context |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Early entry signals; best when filtered by longer-term trends |

| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line cross | Additional confirmation to reduce false positives |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold; potential reversals | Divergences and extremes to flag reversals in context of trend |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level; stop/size guidance | Helps place stops and size positions appropriately during volatile periods |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Trend validated by volume | Confirms price action with volume, reducing false signals |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching NFLX data now and then generate the full, detailed report with the eight indicators applied. Please tell me whether to retry immediately.
