I attempted to fetch the GOOGL data with get_YFin_data, but I’m hitting a backend error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It seems the data retrieval step isn’t available right now, so I can’t compute the indicators at the moment. I can try again shortly if you’d like, or we can proceed with a qualitative plan and the indicator setup you’ll get as soon as the data fetch works.

Proposed indicator setup for GOOGL (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
Rationale: GOOGL is a mega-cap tech stock with meaningful trend, momentum, volatility, and price-action dynamics around earnings and market regimes. The combination below aims to capture medium-term trend, short-term momentum, key volatility signals, and risk management.

Selected indicators (in a cohesive, non-redundant set)
1) close_50_sma
- What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why it’s relevant: Helps identify the prevailing trend and potential bounce/break zones in a high-visibility stock like GOOGL.

2) close_200_sma
- What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend benchmark.
- Why it’s relevant: Confirms overall market regime (bullish vs bearish) and helps identify longer-term cross signals (golden/death cross).

3) close_10_ema
- What it measures: 10-period exponential moving average; near-term momentum.
- Why it’s relevant: Responds quickly to price changes, useful for early momentum signals and as a filter with longer-term averages.

4) macd
- What it measures: MACD line (difference of EMAs); momentum direction and strength.
- Why it’s relevant: Crossover dynamics can signal shifts in trend, especially when aligned with longer-term SMAs.

5) macds
- What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD).
- Why it’s relevant: Crosses of MACD vs MACDS provide additional confirmation to entry/exit signals.

6) rsi
- What it measures: Relative Strength Index; momentum strength and potential reversals.
- Why it’s relevant: Highlights overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences, useful in volatile tech names.

7) boll_ub
- What it measures: Bollinger Upper Band (upper boundary of volatility envelope).
- Why it’s relevant: Signals potential overbought pressure or breakout zones when price tests/holds the upper band, especially when aligned with momentum indicators.

8) atr
- What it measures: Average True Range; market volatility level.
- Why it’s relevant: Critical for sizing risk and setting realistic stops in a market with periodic earnings-driven moves.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed trend/momentum/volatility narrative for GOOGL using the 8 indicators above.
- A cross-confirmation view (e.g., price crossing above 50SMA while MACD/RSI align) and potential scenarios (trending continuation vs. risk of reversal).
- Practical trading notes (entry/exit considerations with example thresholds, risk management tips using ATR for stop placement).

Next steps
- Option A: I retry the data fetch automatically now and proceed with calculating these 8 indicators once the CSV is available.
- Option B: If you prefer, I can provide a qualitative, data-free assessment of GOOGL’s recent context and how these indicator signals would typically behave under various scenarios, but without exact numeric signals.

Please tell me:
- Should I retry the data fetch now, or would you like me to proceed with a qualitative backdrop in the meantime?

Appendix: quick reference table of the planned indicators and their roles
| Indicator | What it measures | Interpreting for GOOGL |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA signals uptrend; price below suggests weakness or potential pullback; cross with price can indicate entry/exit filters. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA supports bullish regime; price below reinforces bearish bias; cross (e.g., 50SMA above/below 200SMA) provides longer-term signals. |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts in momentum; price crossing above/below 10EMA can hint at near-term entries or reversals, especially when aligned with other signals. |
| macd | Momentum direction/strength | MACD line crossing above/below zero and cross with signal line indicate momentum shifts; divergence with price can foreshadow reversals. |
| macds | MACD signal line | Crosses with MACD add confirmation to momentum signals; helps reduce false positives in choppy markets. |
| rsi | Momentum strength, overbought/oversold | RSI >70 overbought, <30 oversold; watch for divergences with price and confirmations from trend indicators. |
| boll_ub | Upper volatility boundary | Price touching/holding above boll_ub can indicate overbought pressure or breakout potential in a trending move; require confirmation from other tools. |
| atr | Volatility level | Higher ATR means larger price moves; use to size stops and adjust position risk based on current volatility regime. |

I’ll proceed with data retrieval as soon as the backend issue is resolved. If you want, I can also run a quick qualitative assessment of GOOGL’s context today and outline how the indicator signals would likely surface in the current environment.
