Decision: HOLD

Rationale
- Long-term upside remains credible: Alphabet’s AI-enabled monetization, search dominance, and cloud scale offer durable growth optionality, supported by a strong balance sheet.
- Near-term pressures create a tempered view: AI capex can compress margins in the short run; ad cycles can slow revenue growth; and regulatory risk remains a meaningful headwind that can inject volatility.
- The plan’s stance aligns with a cautious stance: Upgrading to Buy requires tangible, durable near-term monetization progress and regulatory clarity that meaningfully reduces downside risk.

What would move me to Buy (upside catalysts)
- Demonstrable, durable AI-driven monetization across ads, search, and cloud that meaningfully lifts ARPU and cloud margins.
- Clear evidence of margin expansion in Google Cloud (higher incremental ROIC from AI workloads) with improving operating leverage.
- Regulatory developments that meaningfully reduce downside risk without constraining core monetization.
- Positive earnings prints with guidance upgrades and visibility into AI/Cloud demand cycles.

What would move me to Sell or trim
- Weak AI monetization progress, persistent margin pressure, or opex outpacing revenue growth.
- Regulatory crackdowns that materially raise costs or restrict core products.
- Deteriorating macro ad environment or cloud demand, leading to sustained guidance disappointment.
- Valuation re-rating without commensurate improvement in fundamentals.

Strategic actions and concrete steps
- Position management
  - If already long, maintain disciplined stop losses and consider hedging if risk exposure is material.
  - For new entrants, adopt a staged approach rather than full allocation until catalysts materialize.
- Entry/exit framework (basic guidance for live monitoring)
  - Watch for price action breaking above key moving averages with positive momentum signals (e.g., MACD, RSI within reasonable range).
  - Use modest risk limits (e.g., 1-2% of capital per trade; total single-name exposure 10-15% of risk capital) and implement a trailing stop on any move toward Buy.
- Catalysts and cadence
  - Align decisions with earnings dates, AI/product updates, cloud deal milestones, and regulatory news.
  - Reassess stance quarterly with updated results and new AI/Cloud milestones.

Implementation plan (high level)
- Phase 1 (today): Maintain Hold; set alerts for the 8 indicator framework and key catalysts; consider hedging if already exposed.
- Phase 2 (next 1–2 quarters): If indicators align and AI/Cloud progress accelerates, implement a staged tilt toward Buy (e.g., 25–50% of planned exposure on confirmed signals).
- Phase 3: If catalysts show durable progress and valuation remains reasonable, escalate to Buy; otherwise, trim or revert to Hold.

Learning and governance
- Maintain discipline against narrative-driven moves; require concrete monetization progress and regulatory clarity before upgrading.
- Implement a quarterly review with updated data to prevent drift from the strategic thesis and to adjust exposure as new information arrives.
