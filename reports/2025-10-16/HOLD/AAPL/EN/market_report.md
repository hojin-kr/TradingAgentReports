Sorry—I hit an issue fetching the data right now. The Yahoo Finance data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError, which looks like an environment-side problem rather than a user input issue. I can retry immediately, or wait a bit and try again. If you’d like, I can also attempt to run a parallel check with the stock indicators while the data fetch is retried. Please tell me which you prefer.

In the meantime, here is a solid, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators I’ll use for AAPL to give complementary insights (trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context). Once the data fetch succeeds, I’ll generate a detailed, nuanced report with actual values and signal interpretations.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm medium-term trend when price is above/below it; lags price, so use for confirmation with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark and helps identify major regime (golden/death cross context). Best for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent entries.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Responsive short-term momentum signal; useful for near-term entries when aligned with other trend indicators.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum indicator showing divergence/crossover signals; useful for confirming trend changes when combined with other filters.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoothing line; crossovers with MACD line generate tradable signals with added confirmation.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; watch for divergences and cross-check with trend.
- atr: ATR. A measure of volatility used to size positions and place stops; helps adapt risk to current market conditions.
- vwma: VWMA. Volume-weighted moving average; combines price action with volume to confirm trends and filter out false signals in volume-driven moves.

Why these 8 are suitable for AAPL in a current market context
- They cover multiple angles without heavy overlap, giving you a robust read on: 
  - trend direction (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA for timing),
  - momentum shifts (MACD components, RSI),
  - volatility and risk (ATR),
  - and volume-supported trend confirmation (VWMA).
- Excludes redundancy from using all MACD variants and avoids mixing too many indicators in the same category (e.g., RSI with Stochastic RSI to avoid overlapping signals).
- Provides actionable signals for different time horizons: 50/200 SMA for longer-term bias, 10 EMA for shorter-term timing, MACD for momentum changes, RSI for potential reversals, ATR for risk management, VWMA for confirming move with volume.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A very detailed, nuanced narrative describing:
  - the prevailing trend and momentum (with lines of evidence from the chosen indicators),
  - any bullish or bearish divergences,
  - volatility regime and risk implications (stop placement guidance),
  - how volume is aligning with price action (VWMA signals),
  - potential scenarios and trade setups with threshold interpretations (e.g., MACD cross plus RSI confluence, price above 50/200 SMAs with rising VWMA, etc.),
  - concrete, action-oriented takeaways (entry, exit, stop placement) tailored to a defined horizon (intraday, swing, or longer-term) based on the observed data.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, signals, and interpretations.

Proposed next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now. If you prefer, I can wait a few minutes and retry automatically, or I can proceed with the indicator plan once you confirm you want me to re-run immediately.
- If you have a preferred trading horizon (intraday, 1–5 days, swing, or longer-term), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis and thresholds accordingly.

Markdown table: Key indicators and roles (to be populated with data once available)

- Indicator | Role | Signal Type | Interpretation Context
- close_50_sma | Trend direction / dynamic support | Trend confirmation | Price above/below suggests bullish/bearish bias; cross with 10 EMA for timing.
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Trend confirmation | Helps identify regime (bullish if above, bearish if below); watch for cross with 50 SMA for major trend signals.
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Momentum signal | Quick shifts; use with longer-term trend for entries/exits.
- macd | Momentum strength | Crossover/divergence | MACD above/below signal line confirms momentum; cross with price trend for entries.
- macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing signal | Crosses with MACD line to trigger/confirm signals.
- rsi | Overbought/oversold momentum | Reversal/d divergence signals | 70/30 thresholds; divergences add conviction when aligned with trend.
- atr | Volatility / risk management | Volatility-based stop sizing | Higher ATR suggests wider stops; adjust position sizing accordingly.
- vwma | Volume-supported trend | Trend confirmation with volume | Price action confirmed by volume; reduces false signals in volume-spike moves.

Important: I’ll populate the trend narrative, precise signal triggers, and any recommended trades as soon as the data fetch succeeds. Would you like me to retry data retrieval now? If so, I’ll run another fetch attempt immediately and then generate the full, data-backed report with the 8 indicators above.
