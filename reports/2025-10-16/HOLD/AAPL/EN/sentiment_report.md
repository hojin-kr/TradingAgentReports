I’m running into a backend error when trying to fetch Reddit stock data for AAPL on 2025-10-16. The tool returns: FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory. This looks like a temporary issue on the data service side.

Options to move forward:
- Retry now in case the issue is resolved.
- Try a nearby date range (e.g., 2025-10-15 to 2025-10-16) to still capture recent sentiment.
- Switch to alternative sources (if you’re open to it) to continue the sentiment/news analysis while the Reddit tool is unavailable. I can summarize from other sources you specify or I can wait for the Reddit data to come back and proceed with the full report then.
- Proceed with a structured draft of the long-form report framework (sentiment methodology, potential implications for traders, etc.) so we’re ready to fill in the data as soon as the tool returns.

What would you like me to do?
1) Retry fetching Reddit data now.
2) Try a nearby date range.
3) Expand to other sources now (please specify which sources you want).
4) Proceed with the report framework and placeholders until data is available.

If you’d like, I can also present the planned long-form report outline now, including how I’ll structure sentiment analysis, daily sentiment breakdown, and trading implications, and I’ll populate it with concrete findings as soon as the data tool is working again. Here’s the outline I plan to use (will fill in with actual data):

- Executive snapshot: current sentiment stance, notable spikes, and any visible catalysts.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: day-by-day sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative), volume of posts, and top themes per day.
- Social media signal vs. news signal: cross-check between Reddit chatter and company-news coverage.
- Top themes and posts: recurring topics (e.g., product announcements, earnings expectations, supply chain chatter, macro concerns) with representative post examples.
- Sentiment drivers and catalysts: what tends to move sentiment (earnings, product launches, regulatory issues, supply chain news, guidelines changes).
- Price sentiment correlation: any observed lag between sentiment shifts and price moves (if price data is available alongside sentiment).
- Risk and volatility assessment: potential overreactions, meme-like topics, and hedging considerations.
- Trader takeaways: actionable implications (short-term catalysts, sentiment-driven risk management, entry/exit ideas).
- Limitations and data gaps: what’s missing, what to watch for, and how data quality may affect conclusions.
- Appendix: data sources, methodology, and definitions.
- Makrdown table (at the end): key findings, confidence, and potential catalysts.

If you pick option 1 or 2, I’ll proceed immediately and deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as I have the Reddit data.
