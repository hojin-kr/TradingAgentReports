I’m running into a data retrieval issue on the price data source right now (FileNotFoundError from the data tool). I can’t compute or report the actual indicator values yet. If you’d like, I can:

- Retry fetching the data immediately, or
- Proceed with a detailed, qualitative framework now (describing how I’d interpret the eight indicators for QQQ, once data is available), so you can act on it right away and I can fill in the numbers as soon as data comes back.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) for QQQ (tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 ETF) and why they’re suitable
Note: These are chosen to provide complementary insights without redundancy, covering trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context.

1) close_50_sma
- What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- How to use: Price above 50SMA suggests a bullish intermediate trend; price below suggests a bearish one. Look for crossovers (price crossing above/below 50SMA) as potential signals or as filters for entry signals from faster indicators.
- Why it’s suitable for QQQ: Helps capture the mid-term drift in a sector that can shift with earnings cycles and macro news.

2) close_200_sma
- What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark and major support/resistance level.
- How to use: Price above 200SMA is commonly viewed as bullish in the long run; price below is bearish. Golden cross (when 50SMA crosses above 200SMA) and death cross (opposite) provide strategic context.
- Why it’s suitable for QQQ: Provides a broad-market trend anchor in a high-growth, high-volatility ETF.

3) close_10_ema
- What it measures: Short-term momentum and price responsiveness.
- How to use: Use as a quick timing tool; a cross of price (or other trend lines) with the 10 EMA often precedes larger trend signals. Be mindful of noise in choppy markets; use with longer-term filters (50SMA/200SMA).
- Why it’s suitable for QQQ: Helps detect rapid momentum shifts typical in tech-driven moves.

4) macd
- What it measures: Momentum via differences between two EMAs (MACD line vs. signal line).
- How to use: Look for MACD line crossing above/below the signal line, or crossing zero, as momentum change signals. Can confirm with distance between price and major moving averages.
- Why it’s suitable for QQQ: Captures momentum dynamics in a sector that often experiences quick trend changes around earnings and macro news.

5) macdh
- What it measures: MACD histogram, showing momentum strength and changes in momentum pace.
- How to use: Positive growing histogram reinforces bullish momentum; negative growing histogram reinforces bearish momentum. Divergence with price can warn of potential reversals.
- Why it’s suitable for QQQ: Adds a visual gauge of momentum acceleration/deceleration beyond just MACD line crossovers.

6) rsi
- What it measures: Relative momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
- How to use: Typical thresholds are 70 (overbought) and 30 (oversold). Watch for divergences where price makes new highs/lows but RSI does not. In strong trends, RSI can stay extreme; use trend context as a filter.
- Why it’s suitable for QQQ: Helps identify potential reversals in a momentum-driven ETF, especially after extended moves.

7) atr
- What it measures: Volatility, using average true range.
- How to use: Use ATR to scale stops and position sizing. Rising ATR implies higher volatility and wider price swings; adjust risk management accordingly.
- Why it’s suitable for QQQ: Tech names can be volatile around earnings or macro surprises; ATR helps manage risk dynamically.

8) vwma
- What it measures: Volume-weighted moving average, combining price action with volume.
- How to use: Price above VWMA with rising VWMA confirms a volume-backed uptrend; price below or weakening VWMA suggests weaker conviction or distribution.
- Why it’s suitable for QQQ: Adds volume discipline to trend signals, important for an ETF with heavy participation during tech rally/fal lperiods.

What I would deliver once data is available
- A detailed status for each indicator (current value, trend, crossovers, divergences, and signal strength).
- A combined trade assessment (potential long/short entries, stop placement guidance using ATR, and alignment across indicators).
- A concise action plan (entry, exit, risk controls) based on the eight-indicator framework.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now and then run the indicators (up to 8) and produce a full, data-backed report.
- Or, if you prefer, I can proceed with this qualitative framework immediately and fill in the exact numbers as soon as data arrives.

Markdown table: key points by indicator
| Indicator | What it Measures | How to Use in QQQ | Trade Signal Context | Caveats / Notes |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above = bullish medium-term trend; below = bearish; look for price crossovers | Use as a trend filter for entries from faster indicators | Lagging indicator; best used with other signals |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above = long-term bullish; below = bearish; watch for golden/death crosses | Strategic trend confirmation; drift adjustments over weeks | Very lagging; may miss sharp moves |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; signals can precede larger moves | Entry timing or early filter; use with longer-term MA for filtering | Prone to noise in chop markets |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Crosses of MACD line and signal; zero-crosses | Momentum change signals; verify with other indicators | Can generate false positives in low-volatility regimes |
| macdh | Momentum strength (histogram) | Positive growth = strengthening bullish momentum; negative growth = bearish momentum | Gauge momentum strength and potential reversals; divergences flag risk | Can be volatile; use with other filters |
| rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold | >70 overbought; <30 oversold; watch for divergences | Reversals within trend context; use as counter-trend signal filter | In strong trends RSI can stay overbought/oversold long |
| atr | Volatility and stop/risk sizing | Higher ATR = wider price swings; adjust stops/position size | Risk management and stop placement; adapt to current volatility regime | Reactive measure; not directional |
| vwma | Volume-weighted trend confirmation | Price and VWMA direction alignment signals stronger conviction | Confirms price-trend with volume support | Volume spikes can skew readings; interpret in context |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now and proceed with a full indicator report as soon as the data is available. Do you want me to retry, or would you prefer I proceed with this qualitative framework in the meantime?
