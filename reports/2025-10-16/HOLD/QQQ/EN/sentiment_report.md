Thanks for the nudge. I’m running into a tool error fetching Reddit stock news for QQQ right now.

What happened
- The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) on every attempt for the date 2025-10-16. It looks like the data source or path the tool expects isn’t available at the moment, so I can’t pull Reddit sentiment data right this second.

How I propose we proceed (two options)
Option A — Wait for the tool to be fixed and then run the full, data-backed report
- I’ll re-run the Reddit data fetch for the past week (or the exact window you want) and produce a comprehensive, traders-focused report with:
  - Daily sentiment breakdown and key themes
  - Top posts/influencers driving sentiment
  - Notable shifts around major news events or earnings for ETF components
  - News highlights (ETF-level) and macro context
  - Trading implications, risk factors, and a concise watchlist
  - A final Markdown table summarizing key points

Option B — Create an interim, best-effort report without the Reddit feed (use other sources or a high-level framework)
- I’ll deliver a thorough framework and methodology, plus an outline of likely sentiment drivers and potential signals, but without the Reddit-specific sentiment numbers until the tool is available. I can still incorporate:
  - General social sentiment themes around tech and ETFs from public discourse
  - ETF-specific news (flows, holdings updates, notable fund news)
  - Macro/market context impacting QQQ (tech-heavy Nasdaq exposure)

Which option would you prefer? If you’re aiming for a full, data-backed report today, I’ll proceed with Option A as soon as the Reddit tool is accessible again. If you’d rather get the framework and methodology first (Option B), I can deliver that immediately and then swap in the Reddit data as soon as the tool works.

What I can deliver right away (structure you’ll get in either option)
- Executive snapshot: High-level read on sentiment and news impact for QQQ over the requested window
- Sentiment framework: How I would categorize daily sentiment (bullish, bearish, neutral) and the main drivers
- News angle: ETF-level context (flows, rebalances, macro news) and notable earnings or industry events that affect the ETF
- Trader implications: Short-term signals, risk considerations, and watchlist items
- Data table scaffold: A Markdown table template to organize the key points as soon as data arrives

Draft Markdown table scaffold (ready to fill when data is available)
- Columns: Date, Source, Sentiment, Key Drivers, Notable Posts/Events, Implications, Confidence
- Rows: One row per day (or per data batch)

Example scaffold (raw, placeholder)
- Date | Source | Sentiment | Key Drivers | Notable Posts/Events | Implications | Confidence
- 2025-10-10 | Reddit (pending) | Neutral | AI buzz, rate expectations | Top post: “AI rally continues” (link) | Short-term drift muted; watch catalysts | Medium
- 2025-10-11 | News/ETF flows | Bullish | Tech earnings, cloud demand | ETF inflows reported | Potential short-term upside | Medium
- 2025-10-12 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...

Next steps
- Do you want me to proceed with Option A (re-run as soon as the tool is fixed) or Option B (deliver the framework now and fill in data later)?
- If you have a preferred date range (e.g., past 7 days exactly, or a specific window), let me know so I can tailor the report precisely.

If you’d like, I can also proceed with a qualitative, high-level analysis focusing on what traders typically watch for QQQ in a tech-heavy market context, while we wait for the Reddit tool to come back online.
