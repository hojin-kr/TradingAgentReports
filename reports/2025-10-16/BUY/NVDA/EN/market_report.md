I tried to fetch NVDA data with get_YFin_data, but I’m hitting a backend error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can retry or switch to a fallback method if you’d like, but in the meantime I’ll lay out a plan and the most relevant indicators I’d use for NVDA given a typical AI-driven growth/tech stock context. Once the data retrieval works, I’ll run the indicators and provide a detailed, data-backed report.

Recommended indicator set for NVDA (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: confirms medium-term trend direction and potential dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: long-term trend benchmark; helps identify golden/death cross setups and strategic regime shifts.
- close_10_ema: captures quick momentum shifts and potential short-term entry points; useful for gauging recent price velocity.
- macd: momentum-based trend changes; crossovers help spot potential trend reversals or confirm continuations.
- macds: MACD Signal; crossover with MACD line strengthens signal validity and helps filter false positives.
- macdh: MACD Histogram; visualizes momentum strength and divergence tendencies, useful for early alerts in fast markets.
- rsi: momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; watch for divergences in strong trends.
- atr: volatility gauge to guide risk management (stop placement and position sizing) in NVDA’s typically volatile moves.

Rationale and how I’d interpret these together (once data is available)
- Trend backbone: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to establish whether NVDA is in a bullish or bearish regime. A price above both and a bullish cross (50 above 200) supports a long bias; a pullback toward/through these lines can indicate a consolidation or a potential reversion.
- Short-term momentum: Use close_10_ema in conjunction with the MACD family (macd, macds, macdh). If the 10 EMA crosses above the price and MACD shows a positive cross with growing histogram, that strengthens a near-term breakout signal. Conversely, a MACD cross to negative with a shrinking histogram supports a pullback or trend fatigue.
- Momentum strength and risk of reversal: RSI helps assess overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences. In NVDA’s high-volatility context, RSI can stay overbought longer in uptrends; combine with trend direction signals (50/200 SMA) to avoid premature exits.
- Volatility/risk management: ATR informs stop levels and position sizing. A rising ATR suggests higher risk and wider stops; a falling ATR suggests tighter stops may be appropriate as volatility compresses.

Notes and caveats
- NVDA tends to experience sharp moves around AI cycles, earnings, and macro tech sentiment. Relying on multiple indicators with complementary perspectives helps filter false signals.
- Data quality and timing matter: ensure alignment of indicators with intraday vs. end-of-day data if you’re trading on sub-daps. Use ATR for dynamic stop placement rather than static levels.
- If we see conflicting signals (e.g., price above 50/200, but RSI in overbought territory with a negative MACD histogram), give more weight to the trend signal and use tighter risk controls rather than forcing entries.

Next steps (once data retrieval works)
- I’ll pull NVDA price data for a suitable window (e.g., last 1–2 years up to today) and compute the eight indicators above.
- I’ll deliver a detailed, nuanced report with:
  - Trend assessment (structure, key support/resistance, major crossovers)
  - Momentum signals (MACD/RSI alignment, divergences)
  - Volatility and risk posture (ATR, stop-placement guidance)
  - Scenario-driven trade ideas (entry/exit/stop levels) if signals align (and with caution if not)
- I’ll also include a concise Markdown table at the end summarizing the indicators and their interpretation for NVDA.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or should I proceed with the indicator setup and report once the data stream is restored? If you prefer, I can also run a quick fallback using a different data endpoint or a shorter window to get a provisional read.
