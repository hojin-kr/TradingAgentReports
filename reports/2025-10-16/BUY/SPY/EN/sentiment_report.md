I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment for SPY on 2025-10-16, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data fetch backend is currently unavailable for this request.

Options to proceed (your call):
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data pull now and then build the full report with those insights once the tool succeeds.
- Option B: Proceed with a comprehensive, trader-focused analysis using other public signals (e.g., general social sentiment from other platforms, headlines, ETF flow data, macro news, earnings context) and provide a detailed report plus a Markdown table summarizing key points.

If you’d like Option B now, here’s how I’ll structure the report (and I can start immediately):
- Executive snapshot: What SPY is signaling in a macro context (rate expectations, inflation, equity risk appetite).
- Social sentiment synthesis: Qualitative read of chatter from multiple sources (excluding Reddit if you prefer to avoid tool-dependent data), looking for:
  - Overall tone (bullish/bearish/neutral)
  - Common themes (volatility, appetite for tech vs. small caps, rate expectations, geopolitical risk, hedging behavior)
  - notable swing days or momentum shifts
- News and events: Key headlines over the past week that impact SPY (macro data releases, Fed commentary, major earnings from large index constituents, geopolitical developments).
- Market structure and flows: ETF-specific signals (volume, options activity, fund flows, implied volatility cues like VIX interactions).
- Risk/edge points for traders:
  - Scenarios where SPY could break out vs. risk of pullbacks
  - Sector contributions and divergences within the S&P 500
  - Potential catalysts over the next 1–2 weeks
- Practical implications for traders:
  - If you’re a short-term trader: levels to watch, volatility context, timing considerations
  - If you’re a longer-term investor: alignment with macro regime, how sentiment and news balance against fundamentals
- Quick-start checklist and risk controls
- Makrdown table at the end organizing key points (as requested)

Please confirm:
1) Do you want Option A (retry Reddit data later) or Option B (go ahead with the alternative data now)?
2) If Option B, any preferences on sources (e.g., include/exclude Twitter/X sentiment, StockTwits, YouTube/finance channels, major news outlets)? 
3) Any specific time horizon you want the analysis to emphasize (next 5 trading days vs. next 2–4 weeks)?

Once you confirm, I’ll deliver the full report with a clear, trader-oriented set of insights and a Markdown table at the end.
