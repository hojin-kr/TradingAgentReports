Sorry—the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I’ve tried twice, and the data fetcher for TSLA’s Reddit signals isn’t responding right now due to an environment/file issue.

Here are two options to move forward:

- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now (or at a set interval) and then produce the full, data-backed long report with sentiment by day, latest headlines, and a final Markdown table.
- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using other public signals (e.g., general social sentiment themes, notable Tesla news headlines from the past week) without pulling from the Reddit tool. I’ll still deliver a structured long report and a Markdown table at the end, but it will be based on available public signals rather than the Reddit data feed.

Please let me know which you prefer. If you want me to proceed with Option B right away, I can outline and deliver a detailed analysis focusing on:
- Overall sentiment themes (positive, negative, neutral) observed in the last week
- Key drivers likely affecting TSLA sentiment (e.g., product/news events, earnings expectations, regulatory developments)
- Notable headlines and their potential impact on trader behavior
- Possible sentiment-to-price implications and risk considerations for traders
- A concise set of actionable takeaways

And I’ll include a Markdown table at the end organizing the key points. If you have any preferred sources beyond Reddit (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits, major news outlets), tell me and I’ll include those signals as well.
