Decision: Buy (with disciplined, staged exposure and risk controls)

Rationale (how this aligns with the plan and current risk/return dynamics)
- Core bull thesis remains intact: AMD’s position as a multi-source AI compute platform (EPYC CPUs + Instinct GPUs + ROCm ecosystem) plus Helios/ORW deployment creates a durable growth runway. The plan emphasizes multi-customer anchors and a platform moat, which mitigates single-catalyst risk and supports longer revenue visibility.
- Margin and backlog upside potential: As data-center volumes grow and mix tilts toward higher-value accelerators and ROCm licensing, there is a plausible path to improving gross margins over time, especially if ROCm ecosystem traction accelerates.
- Manageable risk with hedges and staged entry: The plan’s emphasis on staged buying, explicit catalysts, and downside protection remains prudent given Nvidia’s dominance and macro sensitivity. A disciplined entry helps capture upside while limiting exposure to execution or macro shocks.

What to do now (actionable plan)
- Position sizing (staged exposure)
  - Start with a base exposure of 1–2% of portfolio value to AMD.
  - Plan to scale to 3–4% if catalysts validate (e.g., stronger ROCm ecosystem momentum, data-center backlog progression, or improving gross margins).
  - Use 1–2% incremental adds only on confirmed catalysts; avoid a large one-shot allocation before clear progress.
- Entry discipline
  - Stage 1 entry: initiate on a meaningful pullback (roughly 5–10% from recent highs or near a defined short-term support) with above-average volume.
  - Stage 2 entry: add on a breakout above a meaningful technical level (e.g., clear move above the 50-day moving average with convincing volume) or after a positive earnings/driver update that confirms backlog growth or margin stabilization.
- Risk controls
  - Stop rules: hard stop at a 12–15% decline from blended average entry price, or use a trailing stop if the position rallies.
  - Hedging: implement a protective hedge such as out-of-the-money puts (6–12 months duration, roughly 5–10% OTM) or a collar to cap downside while preserving upside.
- Catalysts to watch (near-term and longer-term)
  - Near-term: AMD quarterly results (data-center mix, backlog, ROCm progress, gross margin path), ROCm ecosystem momentum, Helios/ORW adoption progress, and any enterprise wins.
  - Longer-term: Oracle’s 2026 ramp for MI450 GPUs, additional OpenAI-like deployments, and sustained data-center backlog growth with margin improvement.
- Metrics to monitor (decision-useful)
  - Data-center revenue growth rate and data-center gross margin trajectory.
  - ROCm adoption indicators (developer activity, workloads accelerated on ROCm).
  - Helios/ORW deployment pace and enterprise customer wins.
  - Backlog visibility and mix shift toward higher-value accelerators.
  - Overall expense trajectory and free cash flow/or cash position.
- Risk triggers and exit plan
  - If backlog growth stalls, ROCm traction falters, or margins fail to stabilize/improve, reduce exposure incrementally or pause purchases.
  - If Nvidia-led price competition accelerates or macro conditions deteriorate, rely on hedges to protect value and reassess catalysts before adding.

Notes on execution realism
- The plan rightly avoids overreliance on a single catalyst and emphasizes explicit milestones, staged entry, and risk controls. The current decision reinforces that approach: gain exposure gradually, monitor data-center dynamics and ROCm momentum closely, and deploy hedges to limit downside risk.

Bottom line
- With a disciplined, staged entry and robust risk management, the potential upside from AMD’s platform moat and multi-customer AI compute runway justifies a Buy stance today.
