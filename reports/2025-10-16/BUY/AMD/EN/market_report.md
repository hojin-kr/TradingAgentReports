I attempted to fetch AMD data and run the requested indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry fetching the data or proceed with a detailed, rule-based analysis using the indicators you asked for. Below I provide a structured, multi-indicator setup with rationale and a plan for interpretation once data is available.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale for AMD
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for AMD in this context
- close_50_sma: Captures the medium-term trend. AMD has periods of pronounced moves tied to product cycles, AI demand, and data center news; the 50-SMA helps identify the prevailing trend and dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: Provides a long-term trend benchmark. Useful to assess whether AMD is in a broader uptrend or downtrend (golden/death cross contexts). Helps with risk posture for position sizing and horizon decisions.
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term measure to catch quick momentum shifts around the longer-term trend. Helpful for timing entries when AMD is in a volatile phase or during catalyst-driven moves.
- macd: Core momentum measure. Crossovers and the MACD line’s relationship to zero provide signals about trend changes, which can be especially relevant around earnings or AI industry news when AMD often sees sharp moves.
- macds: The MACD signal line; its cross with the MACD line can help filter or confirm MACD signals, adding a layer of reliability in mixed-volatility environments.
- macdh: MACD histogram. Shows momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than line crossovers, useful for spotting deteriorating or strengthening momentum ahead of price moves.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold contexts and potential reversals. AMD can experience sustained trends where RSI remains extended; use it in conjunction with trend signals to avoid false reversals.
- atr: A volatility gauge to calibrate stop distances and position sizing. AMD tends to have episodic volatility around product launches, data center cycles, and AI-related news; ATR helps adapt risk management to current volatility.

How signals might be interpreted (framework you can apply once data is available)
- Trend alignment: If price is above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA, and the 50_SMA is above the 200_SMA, that suggests a bullish context. If price is below both, or if 50_SMA is below 200_SMA, that’s a bearish context. Short-term entries (10_EMA) can be considered only when trend alignment supports the move (e.g., price above 50_SMA with a positive MACD cross).
- Momentum confirmation: MACD line crossing above zero and above the MACD signal (macds) supports a bullish setup. Macd histogram turning positive (macdh) reinforces improving momentum. In a rising trend, you’d look for MACD to stay positive and macdh to widen.
- Overbought/oversold checks: RSI near or above 70 in a strong uptrend can indicate potential pullbacks rather than reversal, whereas RSI near or below 30 in a downtrend can indicate relief rallies. Use RSI in the context of the prevailing trend (as defined by the SMAs).
- Volatility management: ATR rising suggests higher expected price swings; consider widening stops or reducing position size. ATR can help gauge whether a breakout is likely to be sustained or prone to shakeouts in AMD’s often volatile environment.

Trading considerations and risk management
- AMD often reacts to sector/speculative catalysts (AI, GPU/CPU cycles, data center demand, supply chain news). Align trades with the dominant trend but remain cautious of sharp sentiment-driven reversals.
- Use ATR to set dynamic stops (e.g., a multiple of ATR) to avoid premature exits during normal volatility bursts.
- Avoid relying on a single indicator. The chosen set provides trend (SMA/EMA), momentum (MACD suite + RSI), and volatility (ATR) signals to reduce false positives.
- Earnings and product-cycle events can cause gaps. Consider higher risk management around known catalysts and use non-gap protection (e.g., lower exposure or hedges) when volatility is expected to spike.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data (get_YFin_data) for AMD and then produce a detailed, data-backed report with current readings for each indicator, plus a synthesized trading outlook.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative interpretation based on typical AMD behavior in similar macro/economic contexts and provide a hypothetical read on how the eight indicators would likely interact given a generic bull/bear scenario.

Proposed next step options
- Retry data fetch now to deliver a data-driven, exact snapshot (the eight indicators above with AMD’s latest values and a full trend/momentum/volatility read).
- Or, you can provide a specific date range (e.g., last 60 or 90 trading days) and I’ll tailor the analysis around that window once data is retrieved.
