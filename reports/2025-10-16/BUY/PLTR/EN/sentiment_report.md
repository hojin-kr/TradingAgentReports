Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit/stock-sentiment data for PLTR but encountered a backend error: FileNotFoundError from the Reddit data tool. That looks like a temporary issue with the data source. I can retry the fetch now, or switch to pulling sentiment from alternative sources (e.g., other social channels or a summarized dataset if you have one). How would you like to proceed?

In the meantime, here is a robust plan and a structured draft for a comprehensive long-form report on PLTR (Palantir) focusing on social sentiment and recent news. I’ve included a scaffold you can fill in once the data feed is working, plus a Markdown table at the end to organize key points.

What I will deliver once data is available
- Daily sentiment mosaic (past 7–10 days) across major social channels (Reddit, X/Twitter, StockTwits, etc.)
- Thematic breakdown of sentiment (AI/Foundry, government wins, competition, earnings guidance, risk factors)
- Notable posts or threads (summaries, sentiment color, follower reach, potential impact signals)
- News digest (recent company news, press releases, regulatory developments, major partnerships or deals)
- Price-action context and potential catalysts (short-term and intermediate-term)
- Risk flags and upside/downside scenarios
- Actionable takeaways for traders (lower/upper-bound risk, hedging ideas, near-term catalysts)
- A clear Markdown table at the end to summarize key points

Draft report outline (structure you’ll see once data is in)
1) Executive snapshot
   - Quick read on sentiment tilt and latest news catalysts
   - Immediately actionable implications for traders

2) Social sentiment landscape (last 7–10 days)
   - Day-by-day sentiment: Positive / Neutral / Negative
   - Top themes by day: AI integration, Foundry adoption, government/compliance, security concerns, earnings commentary
   - Net sentiment delta and notable swing days

3) Thematic deep-dive
   - AI/Foundry adoption and product momentum
   - Government sector traction and regulatory environment
   - Competitive posture vs. peers (e.g., other data analytics competitors)
   - News impact: partnerships, contract wins/losses, policy/regulatory signals

4) News digest (last week)
   - Summary of relevant headlines
   - Potential impact on sentiment and pricing
   - Any material guidance or strategic shifts

5) Price/sentiment integration
   - How sentiment shifts align with price movements
   - Any observed lag or lead-lag relationships
   - Notable anomalies (e.g., sentiment improves while price weakens, or vice versa)

6) Risk assessment
   - Macro or sector risks
   - Company-specific risks (regulatory, contract concentration, competitive pressures)
   - Liquidity and volatility considerations

7) Trader-oriented takeaways
   - Near-term catalysts to monitor (contract announcements, earnings cadence, regulatory updates)
   - Suggested risk management notes (position sizing, hedges, option skews)
   - Scenario analysis (bull case, base case, bear case)

8) Data caveats
   - Data limitations (sampling bias, bot activity, platform moderation)
   - Timing considerations (UTC vs local time, posting delays)

Provisional structure for the Markdown table (fill in with live data)
- I will append this exact table at the end of the report once data is available.

| Key Point | Lens / Source | Sentiment Signal (7d) | Key Drivers | Potential Price/Volatility Implications | Confidence |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|
| Overall sentiment tilt | Social channels mix | TBD (Positive/Neutral/Negative) | AI momentum, Foundry adoption, gov contracts | Potential short-term drift; watch for reversal signals | TBD |
| Top themes driving sentiment | Thematic analysis | TBD | AI/automation, data privacy, regulatory environment | Risk/Reward signals around news catalysts | TBD |
| Notable posts (high visibility) | Reddit/X/StockTwits highlights | TBD | Specific contract wins, porfolio comments by influential accounts | Elevated intraday moves around post times | TBD |
| Recent news catalysts | Company press / filings | N/A | Partnerships, earnings guidance, policy changes | Market interpretation of catalysts | TBD |
| Risk flags cited by community | Sentiment chatter | TBD | Patents, competition, contract concentration | Volatility spikes; hedging considerations | TBD |

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch immediately to populate the sentiment data?
- Or would you prefer I proceed with a qualitative, data-light analysis using only general placeholders, so we can start drafting the narrative while we wait for data?

If you prefer, I can also switch to pulling sentiment from alternative sources (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits, or other aggregators) and we can compile a multi-source composite sentiment once the tool is back online. Just let me know which direction you want.
