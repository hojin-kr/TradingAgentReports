I tried to load PLTR data to generate the indicators, but the data fetch backend returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a temporary issue with the data source. I can retry fetching the data now, or proceed with a strategic indicator setup you can use once the data loads. In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for PLTR (Palantir) and a rationale you can apply once data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for filtering signals from faster indicators.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm bullish/bearish regime and detect golden/death cross setups.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Responsive short-term momentum; can flag quick shifts when used with longer averages for filtering.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: Momentumจน a trend-change proxy via EMA differences; crossovers signal potential entries/exits in conjunction with other filters.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: MACD signal line; its cross with MACD provides clearer trigger points than MACD alone.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: MACD histogram; gauges momentum strength and divergence nuances, helpful to confirm momentum shifts.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Rationale: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold cues; watch for divergences and cross-check with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Rationale: Measures volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing; complements trend and momentum signals.

How to interpret signals once data is loaded (high-level guidance)
- Trend confirmation
  - Price above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA and 50_SMA > 200_SMA supports a bullish backdrop; look for pullbacks to 50_SMA or 10_EMA as potential entries.
  - Golden cross (50_SMA crossing above 200_SMA) is a long-term bullish signal; use in conjunction with MACD and RSI to avoid false positives.
- Momentum
  - MACD line crossing above MACD signal and rising histogram (macdh) reinforces bullish momentum; watch for MACD divergence if price makes new highs without MACD confirming.
  - RSI showing positive divergence in an uptrend or RSI crossing above/below major thresholds (e.g., crossing 50 or 70) can help time entries or exits when aligned with price action.
- Volatility and risk
  - ATR rising suggests expanding volatility; adjust stop losses and position sizing accordingly.
  - Use ATR to place stops a multiple of ATR away from entry to accommodate current volatility rather than fixed dollar amounts.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching PLTR data now and then compute the eight indicators exactly as listed, followed by a detailed, data-backed trend report with a final actionable framing.
- Alternatively, if you’d like to proceed immediately with a qualitative trend assessment in the absence of fresh data, I can provide a scenario-based interpretation framework (e.g., what to watch for if the price is near the 50/200 SMA, how MACD/rsi would likely behave in a bullish vs. bearish PLTR setup).

Would you like me to retry loading the PLTR data now and generate the full, data-backed indicators and report? If you prefer, I can proceed with the qualitative framework right away and run the data fetch in parallel. Also, feel free to specify your trading horizon (intraday, swing, or longer-term) and risk tolerance to tailor the interpretation. 

Key indicators summary (for quick reference)
- close_50_sma: Moving Average (middle-term trend)
- close_200_sma: Moving Average (long-term trend)
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum
- macd: Momentum (trend change signals)
- macds: MACD signal line
- macdh: MACD histogram (momentum strength)
- rsi: Relative momentum and overbought/oversold cues
- atr: Volatility and risk management

Table: Key indicators and their purpose
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Category: Moving Averages | Purpose: Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Category: Moving Averages | Purpose: Long-term trend confirmation and regime detection
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Category: Moving Averages | Purpose: Short-term momentum shifts and entry timing
- Indicator: macd | Category: MACD Related | Purpose: Momentum and potential trend-change signals
- Indicator: macds | Category: MACD Related | Purpose: Signal-line cross confirmations

Notes
- The data fetch error is a backend issue, not a user error. If you’d like, I can retry immediately or on a schedule you prefer.
- If you share your preferred horizon and risk preferences, I can tailor the final actionable signals (entry/exit suggestions) once the data is loaded.
