Thanks for trying. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit/stock news for GOOGL on 2025-10-14, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError indicating an internal issue with the Reddit data fetcher. I can’t get the live Reddit sentiment data right now.

Here are your best next options. Please tell me which you’d prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly:

Option A — Retry and continue with the full long report
- I’ll retry the Reddit stock info fetch as soon as the tool is available again.
- Once it returns data, I’ll deliver a comprehensive long report detailing:
  - Daily sentiment trends on social media (Reddit and other sources if available)
  - Key themes, concerns, catalysts, and notable memes or narratives
  - Relevant recent company news (earnings, product updates, regulatory, partnerships)
  - Sentiment vs. price/action analysis with potential implications for traders
  - Fine-grained insights (who is bullish vs bearish, risk factors, periodical patterns)
  - Practical takeaways for traders (short-term routes, risk management, watchpoints)
  - A final Makrdown table organizing key points (summary, drivers, sentiment, and implications)

Option B — Proceed with a qualitative, structured framework now (no live data)
- I’ll provide a detailed analysis framework and a sample skeleton report you can review while we wait for the data tool to come back.
- I’ll include:
  - Methodology for sentiment scoring (daily buckets, key keywords, influencer signals)
  - Expected data sources to monitor (Reddit threads, major finance subs, news outlets, Google/press releases)
  - Potential catalysts to watch (product announcements, ad revenue trends, AI integration, regulatory risks)
  - Trader-oriented implications (scenarios, price/volatility expectations, risk overlays)
  - A placeholder Makrdown table structure for you to fill in with actual data once available

Option C — Use alternative sources you approve
- If you’d like, I can summarize other publicly accessible information (e.g., company news, official announcements, financial press) and provide a sentiment-like synthesis based on that content, pending access to the Reddit data when the tool issue is resolved.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry now, I’ll attempt again as soon as the tool is back.
