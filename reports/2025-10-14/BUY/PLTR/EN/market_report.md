I tried to fetch PLTR data using get_YFin_data, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend data retrieval issue). I attempted twice and it didn’t work. I don’t want to delay you, so I’ll proceed with a solid indicator plan now and will run the data fetch as soon as the data source is available again. When the data is retrievable, I’ll generate the full, data-driven report with values and signals and tie them to the plan below.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it provides: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why PLTR: Helps identify the prevailing trend in a volatile growth/tech name and provides a reference for pullbacks or rallies.
  - How to use: Price above 50SMA suggests upside bias; a cross of price below 50SMA can warn of a trend pause or reversal.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it provides: Long-term trend context and a macro-level benchmark (golden/death cross reference).
  - Why PLTR: Aligns with larger market regime and helps filter trades in choppier periods.
  - How to use: Look for price staying above 200SMA for bullish bias; cross below can indicate longer-term risk.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it provides: Responsive short-term momentum indication.
  - Why PLTR: Captures quick shifts in momentum that may precede larger trend moves.
  - How to use: Use as a fast timer; look for price/10EMA crossovers as early entry signals, but confirm with higher-timeframe trend (50SMA/200SMA).

- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it provides: Momentum shift and trend-change potential via MACD line vs. signal line dynamics.
  - Why PLTR: Helps identify momentum-driven entries/exits in a stock known for rapid swings.
  - How to use: Consider MACD line crossing above the signal as a potential bullish trigger, especially when aligned with price above major moving averages.

- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it provides: MACD signal line, smoothing to confirm cross signals.
  - Why PLTR: Adds confidence to MACD-derived entries/exits and helps filter false positives.
  - How to use: MACD crossing above MACDs signal line strengthens the case for entry when other signals agree.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicator
  - What it provides: Relative momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why PLTR: Helps flag potential reversals in a stock that can extend trends before mean-reversion.
  - How to use: Watch for RSI moving into overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) zones and look for bullish/bearish divergences in conjunction with price trends.

- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicator
  - What it provides: Market volatility level and a basis for dynamic risk management (stop placement, position sizing).
  - Why PLTR: Useful in volatile tech/growth names where swings can be pronounced; helps avoid underestimating risk in fast moves.
  - How to use: Use ATR to set distance-based stops; rising ATR can indicate expanding volatility and potentially larger moves.

- vwma
  - Category: Volume-Based Indicator
  - What it provides: Trend confirmation incorporating volume (volume-weighted price).
  - Why PLTR: Volume-driven confirmation is valuable for a stock that can exhibit divergent price moves with low liquidity at times.
  - How to use: Price above VWMA with rising VWMA adds conviction to trend moves; use crossovers or sustained divergence as entry/exit cues.

Rationale for this combination
- Complements across four dimensions: trend (50SMA/200SMA, 10EMA), momentum (MACD, MACD signal, RSI), volatility (ATR), and volume-based confirmation (VWMA).
- Avoids redundancy: Instead of stacking all MACD components or multiple oscillators, we keep MACD and MACD Signal for robust momentum confirmation and RSI for independent momentum perspective.
- Tailored to PLTR’s profile: A tech-focused, potentially high-volatility name benefits from a multi-timeframe trend view (mid/long-term SMAs), prompt momentum signals (MACD and RSI), risk-aware volatility measures (ATR), and volume-based confirmation (VWMA.

How signals might be combined in practice (illustrative approach)
- Entry (bullish bias): Price above 50SMA and 200SMA, price above 10EMA, MACD crosses above its signal, RSI above 50 but not overbought, VWMA confirming price action, ATR not in extreme expansion that would imply an outsized whipsaw.
- Exit/stop considerations: Use ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR) and move stops to break-even or trailing levels as VWMA confirms ongoing volume-supported moves; monitor MACD/MACD Signal for potential momentum loss.
- Watch for divergence signals: RSI divergence with price or MACD/Signal divergence can forewarn of a upcoming reversal, especially after a strong up move.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed, data-driven trend report for PLTR using the 8 indicators above, including:
  - Current regime assessment (trend direction, momentum, volatility, volume confirmation)
  - Key levels (support/resistance derived from SMAs and VWMA)
  - Signal interpretations (specific buy/sell cues with thresholds)
  - Dynamic risk management recommendations (stop levels based on ATR, position sizing guidance)
  - A concise decision framework (how to act given different signal confluences)

Next steps
- I’ll re-run data retrieval as soon as the data backend is available again and then compute the selected indicators for PLTR with the date range you requested (2024-04-01 to 2025-10-14). I’ll produce a detailed trend report with concrete signals, level-by-level guidance, and a formatted table like the outline above.
- If you’d like, I can also switch to a slightly different 8-indicator combination (e.g., swap boll for another measure) or add one more indicator if you have a specific trading style (scalp, swing, or position) in mind.
