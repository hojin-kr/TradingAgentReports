Thanks for the patience. I’m running into an internal tool error fetching Reddit stock data for PLTR on 2025-10-14 (FileNotFoundError). I can’t retrieve the Reddit-based sentiment data right this moment. I can retry shortly, or we can proceed with a robust plan and I’ll deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as the tool is available again. Here are the two options:

Option A — Retry now
- I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again immediately and then generate the long-form report with:
  - Daily sentiment breakdown (last 7 days)
  - Top themes and representative posts from r/PLTR and related subreddits
  - Notable news items impacting sentiment (past week)
  - Trader-centric implications (short-term vs. longer-term)
  - Risk factors and potential catalysts
  - A final Markdown table organizing key points

Option B — Proceed with plan (no Reddit data yet)
- I’ll outline and deliver a comprehensive analysis framework and fill in all sections with the best available context and methodological notes, then automatically slot in Reddit findings as soon as the tool comes back online. This ensures you have a detailed actionable report without waiting.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option A (retry now) and I’ll include a brief status update in the report if the fetch succeeds or fails again. Alternatively, tell me to proceed with Option B and I’ll deliver the full framework now and populate Reddit insights as soon as possible.

What would you prefer? In the meantime, here’s the high-level structure I’ll use for the long-form report (so you can see what you’ll get once the data is in):

- Executive snapshot
  - Brief summary of sentiment trajectory, notable news, and implicit market cues
- Social sentiment deep-dive (past 7 days)
  - Daily sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Post volume and engagement trends
  - Top themes and representative posts (with caveats about amplification risk on Reddit)
- News and catalysts (past week)
  - Key company announcements, partnerships, earnings timing, regulatory/regulatory-spotlights
  - Market interpretation and immediate sentiment impact
- Price/sentiment correlation
  - Any observable relationship between sentiment shifts and intraday/close price moves
- Thematic drivers and risk factors
  - AI/product updates, government/commercial mix, competitive landscape, data/privacy concerns
- Trader-oriented implications
  - Short-term trading cues (1–5 days), medium-term view (weeks), and caveats
- Potential catalysts to watch
  - Upcoming events, contracts, or policy changes that could move sentiment
- Risks and mitigants
  - Sentiment fragility, meme-driven spikes, data ambiguity
- Key takeaways
- Markdown table (final section)
  - Date | Daily Sentiment | Top Theme | Notable Posts | News Highlights | Price Context

If you want me to proceed now with a retry (Option A), I’ll run it and then deliver the full report with the Markdown table appended as requested.
