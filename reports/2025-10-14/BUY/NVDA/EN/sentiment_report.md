Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the NVDA Reddit stock data for 2025-10-14 but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the Reddit data retrieval tool is currently unavailable. I can try again shortly, but in the meantime I can still move forward with a robust framework and a high-quality, trader-focused analysis using the best available public context and a clear plan for when the data comes back.

Here's how I can proceed, plus a detailed framework you can reference or approve before I fill in data.

What I can do right now
- Provide a comprehensive analyst framework for NVDA that covers social sentiment, recent news, and trading implications, tailored for traders and investors.
- Outline the exact data fields I would extract from Reddit/social sources, how I would interpret them, and how to translate them into actionable trading ideas.
- Deliver a draft long-form report structure and a Markdown-compatible summary table with key points, ready to populate once the sentiment/news data is available.
- If you’d like, I can retry the Reddit data fetch immediately or on a schedule (e.g., every hour) until it succeeds.

Proposed long-report structure (NVDA, past week, social sentiment + news)
1) Executive snapshot
- One-paragraph summary of the stock’s sentiment and news stance over the past week.
- Immediate read on potential upside/downside catalysts and risk factors.

2) Social media sentiment analysis (past 7 days)
- What to measure:
  - Volume of posts mentioning NVDA
  - Net sentiment (positive vs negative vs neutral)
  - Dominant themes (e.g., AI demand, product cycles, supply chain, valuation concerns, earnings expectations)
  - Notable spikes tied to events (earnings, rumors, or product announcements)
- How to interpret:
  - Sustained positive sentiment with rising volume plus favorable themes around AI adoption often supports price upside in the near-term, especially if supported by strong fundamentals.
  - Sudden negative sentiment spikes tied to supply/demand concerns, regulatory chatter, or earnings disappointment may precede short-term pullbacks.
  - Mixed or oscillating sentiment with no clear direction can imply a wait-and-see environment or range-bound price action.

3) Recent company news highlights (past 7 days)
- Earnings/Guidance: any surprises, margin implications, or AI demand signals
- Product/tech: new hardware/software releases, data-center deployments, or partnerships
- Supply chain/regulatory: any constraints, export controls, or geopolitical factors
- Market/competitive landscape: driver's competition (e.g., AMD, Intel) and tape-in AI demand narratives
- Sentiment effects: how the headlines align with or contradict social sentiment signals

4) Price action and market structure (contextual, not a price forecast)
- Short- to medium-term price moves, volume, and notable technical levels
- Options activity signals if available (skew, call/put ratio) and how they align with sentiment
- Key catalysts to watch (upcoming earnings, product launches, or policy changes)

5) Drivers, catalysts, and risk factors
- Positive catalysts: accelerators in AI compute demand, enterprise adoption, cloud spending trends
- Negative catalysts: supply constraints, macro risk, demand softening, competitive threats
- Tactical risks: sentiment reversals, rate expectations, geopolitical events

6) Trading implications and scenarios
- Bull case: what needs to happen to push NVDA higher in the next 2–4 weeks
- Bear case: failure modes that could trigger a pullback
- Neutral/base case: expected range and strategy ideas (range trades, hedging, or wait-and-see)
- Suggested trading ideas (without financial advice): levels to watch, potential entry/exit zones, risk controls

7) Data gaps and caveats
- Noting where sentiment data may be incomplete or lagging (e.g., if Reddit/X data is delayed)
- Limitations of public sentiment as a leading indicator
- Need for corroboration with fundamentals and macro context

8) Appendices (optional)
- Daily sentiment digest (if data available)
- Top Venus themes and representative sample posts (with sources)

Makrdown table (format to fill after data comes back)
- I will append a concise Markdown table at the end of the final report with key takeaways. A suggested schema:
  - Date
  - Source (Reddit, X, news outlet)
  - Headline/Theme
  - Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative)
  - Driver/Reason
  - Implications for NVDA (short-term)
  - Confidence Level (Low/Med/High)

What I need from you
- Do you want me to retry fetching the Reddit stock data for NVDA now, or would you prefer I proceed with the framework and prepare a full draft report once the data fetch succeeds?
- If you want an immediate draft without real-time sentiment data, I can produce a best-effort, non-live qualitative analysis based on public NVDA context up to today and clearly label it as non-live.

If you’d like me to retry the data fetch now, I’ll run another attempt as soon as possible and then fill in the sentiment details, news highlights, and the final table accordingly. Please confirm which option you prefer.
