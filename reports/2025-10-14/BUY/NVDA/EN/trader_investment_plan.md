Recommendation:
- Buy NVDA, using a disciplined, staged entry with explicit risk controls and hedges as outlined in the plan.

Why this aligns with the plan:
- Long-term growth thesis remains intact: secular AI compute expansion, CUDA ecosystem moat, and TAM expansion through software/platforms (Spectrum-X, DGX Spark) suggest durable earnings upside.
- Near-term volatility and valuation sensitivity are real, but manageable with staged sizing and hedging to preserve upside while limiting downside.

Key execution steps (concise):
- Stage 1 entry: Consider initiating ~25% of target exposure if NVDA tests a downside zone in the mid-to-high 160s to low 170s, with a tight ATR-based stop and trend confirmation.
- Stage 2 add-on: If price breaks above the 190–200 zone on strong volume with positive momentum signals, deploy an additional 25–50% of the target.
- Stage 3 complete: If sustained strength continues above 200–210 with continued trend confirmation, reach full allocation.

Risk controls:
- Use ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.5x ATR) to accommodate volatility; place stops in relation to key moving averages and recent swing highs.
- Hedge with options around key catalysts (protective puts or collars) to cap downside during policy announcements, earnings, or macro-inactivity periods without capping all upside.
- Maintain a cash buffer to avoid over-allocating in a volatile name and keep room to adjust.

Monitoring framework:
- 2–3 signal confirmation before each stage:
  - Trend: price above rising 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
  - Momentum: positive MACD cross with rising RSI (not extended).
  - Volatility: controlled ATR expansion with a price breakout rather than random spikes.
- Catalyst dashboard: track Spectrum-X momentum, DGX Spark uptake, hyperscaler capex commentary, and policy headlines. Be prepared to scale down or hedge further if negative catalysts emerge.

Past decisions and learnings:
- There are no prior mistakes recorded in this context; the plan explicitly emphasizes multi-signal confirmation and hedging to avoid common pitfalls (overreliance on a single signal and unhedged exposure).

Next steps:
- If you want, I can fetch current NVDA data and confirm exact levels for Stage 1 triggers, compute ATR, and generate a ready-to-execute readout with precise entry/exit parameters.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
