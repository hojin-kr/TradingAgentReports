Thanks for the nudge. Quick status update:

- I attempted to fetch Reddit-based stock sentiment data for AAPL across the requested dates (2025-10-08 to 2025-10-14) in parallel, and a subsequent single-call for 2025-10-14. All attempts returned a FileNotFoundError from the Reddit data tool, so I don’t currently have the daily sentiment data to report.

What I can do next (two options):

1) Retry and wait for the Reddit data tool to come back up, then produce the full, day-by-day sentiment report and the detailed long analysis you asked for.

2) Proceed with a qualitative, data-light Apple (AAPL) analysis right now, and then insert the Reddit sentiment results as soon as the tool is available again. This would include a structured framework for how the sentiment would be integrated (themes, bullish/bearish signals, and catalysts) without the actual daily numbers yet.

If you’d like, I can start with option 2 and deliver a complete long-form report framework plus a Markdown-summary table, ready to be populated with the Reddit data as soon as the tool is functional again.

Here’s what I propose to deliver in the long report (both now and updated once the Reddit data is back):

- Executive summary: A concise view of the current sentiment landscape for AAPL, potential catalysts, and implications for traders.

- Social sentiment overview (structure you’ll get once data is live):
  - Daily sentiment scores by date (AAPL) with bullish/bearish/mixed classification
  - Top themes driving sentiment each day (e.g., product/news events, supply chain, financial results, AI features)
  - Key subreddits and notable posts that are shaping sentiment

- News and events snapshot (past week):
  - Summary of relevant company/industry news that could influence sentiment
  - Any earnings, product announcements, regulatory updates, or major partnerships

- Thematic analysis and implications for traders:
  - Price-dispassion vs. sentiment correlations
  - Potential short-term catalysts and risks
  - Sector/market context (MSFT, NVDA comparisons if relevant)

- Risk considerations:
  - Sentiment-driven vol spikes, overhang risks, and potential counterfeit narratives
  - Regulatory or competitive headwinds

- Outlook and scenarios:
  - Bullish, neutral, and bearish case scenarios with likely triggers

- Methodology and data caveats:
  - How sentiment is measured, data cutoffs, and limitations of Reddit data

- Appendices:
  - Data sources, definitions, and a day-by-day sentiment log once available

Markdown table (to organize key points; to be filled with live data)

- Date | Daily Sentiment Score | Bullish/Bearish/Mixed | Top Themes | Notable Posts/Subreddits | News Hooks | Implications for Traders

What I need from you:
- Do you want me to retry immediately to fetch the Reddit data now and proceed with the full day-by-day sentiment report once it returns, or would you prefer I proceed with option 2 (framework-only with placeholders) and fill in data later?

If you choose to proceed now with the framework, I’ll deliver the long report structure, the placeholder table above, and a detailed plan for integrating the Reddit data as soon as the tool is available again.
