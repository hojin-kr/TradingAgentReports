Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AAPL data via the get_YFin_data tool, but I’m hitting a backend FileNotFoundError in the current environment. This looks like an internal file-path issue rather than a problem with the ticker. I can either retry the data pull (perhaps with adjusted dates), or proceed with a strong indicator framework so you can review the approach now and I’ll plug in the exact readings as soon as the data loads. How would you like to proceed?

Indicator framework for AAPL (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)

- close_50_sma
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why important for AAPL: Apple often trades in clear trend regimes around product cycles and earnings. The 50-day SMA helps confirm whether the stock is in a sustained up or down phase and provides a practical benchmark for pullbacks.

- close_200_sma
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark and context for major regime shifts (golden/death crosses).
  - Why important for AAPL: Helps confirm the broader market regime (bullish vs bearish). In uptrends, price staying above the 200-SMA reinforces trend strength; in downtrends, price below it adds weight to downside risk.

- close_10_ema
  - Role: Short-term momentum and quicker reaction signal.
  - Why important for AAPL: The 10-EMA reacts faster to news-driven moves (earnings, product announcements). When it crosses above/below longer-term averages, it can flag early momentum shifts.

- macd
  - Role: Core momentum measure via MACD line crossing/positive divergence.
  - Why important for AAPL: MACD captures shifts in trend strength and momentum, helping you differentiate genuine trend moves from noise, especially around earnings volatility.

- macds
  - Role: MACD signal line (smoother) crossovers as trade triggers.
  - Why important for AAPL: The MACD signal line helps confirm entry/exit signals derived from the MACD line, reducing false positives in choppy markets.

- macdh
  - Role: MACD histogram to visualize momentum divergence magnitude.
  - Why important for AAPL: Histogram growth indicates strengthening momentum; shrinking histogram can foreshadow loss of momentum or potential reversal.

- rsi
  - Role: Momentum oscillator to identify overbought/oversold conditions and divergences.
  - Why important for AAPL: RSI helps spot potential reversals when price has run too far in one direction, especially when used alongside trend indicators to avoid acting on noise in strong trends.

- atr
  - Role: Volatility measure to inform risk management and position sizing.
  - Why important for AAPL: ATR provides a sense of current volatility levels, useful for sizing, stop placement, and risk controls, particularly around earnings and product launches when volatility tends to spike.

Nuanced interpretation framework (how to read the signals once data is loaded)

- Trend alignment
  - If price is above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA, and the 10_EMA is above both, you have multi-timeframe bullish alignment. This supports trend-following entries on pullbacks toward the moving averages or on momentum breakouts.
  - If price is below both SMAs and the 10_EMA is below, you’re in a bearish alignment. Use caution with long entries; look for trend-resumption signals (MACD positive/negative cross changes, etc.).

- Momentum confirmation
  - MACD crossing above zero with MACD histogram expanding to the upside strengthens a bullish move; cross below zero with a widening negative histogram strengthens a bearish move.
  - RSI should be interpreted in context: in a strong uptrend, RSI can remain elevated for extended periods. Look for bullish/bearish divergence rather than just overbought/oversold readings to anticipate reversals in trend context.

- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising indicates increasing volatility, which can widen stops and require larger risk buffers. In high-volatility periods around earnings, rely more on multiple confirmations (MACD, RSI divergence, and price above/below moving averages) rather than a single signal.
  - When ATR is contracting, signals may be less reliable; prefer filters (e.g., MACD, RSI trend alignment) to avoid whipsaw.

- Signal composition and entry/exit ideas
  - Buy signal candidate: price above 50_SMA and 200_SMA with 10_EMA above these averages, MACD line crossing above the signal line, MACD histogram turning positive, RSI rising but not sharply overbought, ATR showing moderate volatility.
  - Sell/short signal candidate: price below 50_SMA and 200_SMA with 10_EMA below these averages, MACD line crossing below the signal line, MACD histogram turning negative, RSI confirming momentum in the downside direction, ATR increasing (risk-managed exits or hedges).
  - In range-bound or choppy markets, require two or more confirming indicators (e.g., MACD histogram momentum and RSI trend or divergence) before acting to avoid false signals.

Data status and next steps

- What I’ll deliver once data loads: exact readings for AAPL across these indicators, plus a consolidated trend assessment (e.g., trending up, trending down, or ranging), and concrete optional trade setups based on your preferred time horizon (intra-day, swing, or position).
- How you can proceed now:
  1) Tell me if you want me to retry the data fetch (potentially with adjusted dates, e.g., last 12–18 months) and I’ll run again.
  2) Or, if you’re comfortable proceeding with the framework above, I can generate concrete signals and a trade plan once the data is available.

Markdown table: key indicators and their roles

| Indicator | Role / Insight | What to watch for | How it helps with AAPL decisions | Practical notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price relative to 50_SMA; crossovers with price | Confirms trend direction and pullback entries around the 50_SMA | Lags price; combine with faster indicators for entries |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price relative to 200_SMA; golden/death cross signals | Context for regime: bullish if above; bearish if below | Slow to respond; best for strategic overlays |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum trigger | Quick shifts; crossovers with price/other averages | Early momentum signals for entry points | Prone to noise; filter with longer-term indicators |
| macd | Core momentum indicator | MACD line vs. signal; zero-line cross; histogram | Confirms momentum shifts and trend changes | Use with other filters to reduce false positives |
| macds | MACD signal line | Crosses with MACD line; histogram behavior | Entry/exit triggers when used with MACD | Smoother signal; helps reduce noise |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength; divergence cues | Early warning of momentum contraction/expansion | Can be volatile; pair with trend indicators |
| rsi | Momentum overbought/oversold; divergences | Divergence from price; readings relative to 70/30 | Signals potential reversals within the current trend | In trending markets, overbought/oversold checks are less reliable |
| atr | Volatility gauge; risk/position sizing | Volatility spikes (earnings/news); ATR changes | Guides stop placement and risk management | Reactive; use with trend/momentum signals for sizing |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now with a different date window, or you can specify a preferred date range (e.g., last 1 year, last 18 months), and I’ll proceed with the indicator-derived plan as soon as the data comes in.
