Short answer: HOLD. The provided framework supports a disciplined, data-driven stance until catalysts materialize and technical conditions confirm trend strength.

Rationale aligned with the plan
- Thesis balance: The bull case for TSLA remains credible (China demand, mix shift, and a diversified moat), but meaningful monetization milestones for AI/robotics and clear FSD regulatory progress are not yet cash-flow visible. This justifies waiting for tangible signals rather than pricing in the optionality.
- Risk framework: The plan emphasizes hedges, defined risk limits, and a staged upgrade only when both catalysts and technicals align. This reduces downside risk in a high-beta name with regulatory and macro sensitivities.
- Technical backdrop: The upgrade path hinges on price trading above key trend lines (e.g., 50-day and 200-day moving averages) with positive MACD cross and expanding volume. Until those signs appear with credible catalysts, maintaining a Hold preserves optionality without overpaying.

Upgrade triggers to watch (and act on)
- Monetization milestones for AI/robotics: visible revenue recognition, user adoption metrics, or subscription-like software revenue appearing in quarterly results.
- Regulatory clarity on FSD monetization: concrete timelines or policies that materially de-risk near-term economics.
- Energy/storage momentum: confirmed megawatt-scale project wins and solid revenue visibility, beyond backlog rhetoric.
- Technical confirmation: price trades above established resistance with increasing volume; price remains above 50-day and 200-day SMAs; MACD positive cross and VWMA trend supports continued upside.

Risk management and execution plan
- If already long: maintain a core with hedges or a controlled incremental exposure; avoid adding aggressively until upgrade criteria are met.
- If not yet long: avoid a large starter position; wait for clear catalysts and confirmatory technicals to trigger a staged entry.
- Use risk controls: ATR-based stops (below recent swing lows or a multiple of ATR), consider protective puts or a collar to cap downside while preserving upside optionality.
- Cadence: weekly 8-indicator framework review; maintain a live catalyst watchlist (FSD regs, China policy, energy/storage awards) with predefined response plans.

Bottom line
- Hold now. You preserve optionality and capital efficiency while awaiting credible monetization milestones and confirmatory technicals. If catalysts materialize and the technicals confirm trend strength, escalate toward a Buy with staged exposure increases and continued risk controls.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
