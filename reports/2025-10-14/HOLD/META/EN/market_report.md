I attempted to fetch META data for the period you asked, but the data retrieval tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. I don’t have fresh price data to run the indicators right now. If you’d like, I can retry in a moment, or proceed with a plan that doesn’t require immediate data until the fetch succeeds. In the meantime, here’s a concise plan and a recommended indicator set you can expect to use once the data comes through.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
Rationale: These provide complementary angles on META’s price action—trend direction, momentum, volatility, and volume context—without overlapping signals.

1) close_10_ema
- Category: Moving Averages (short-term)
- Why: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Good for reacting to recent price moves.

2) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages (medium-term)
- Why: Identifies the prevailing trend and dynamic support/resistance; helps filter noise from the 10-EMA signal.

3) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages (long-term)
- Why: Establishes the long-term trend baseline; useful for major trend confirmation and to identify potential golden/death cross dynamics when combined with shorter averages.

4) macd
- Category: MACD
- Why: Momentum changes and potential trend reversals via MACD line crossovers and divergences; works well with trend filters from the SMAs.

5) macds
- Category: MACD Signal
- Why: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with the MACD line provide more robust entry signals when used with trend proxies like the 50/200 SMAs.

6) rsi
- Category: Momentum
- Why: Momentum gauge with well-known overbought/oversold thresholds; useful for spotting potential reversals, especially when price is extended relative to the trend.

7) boll
- Category: Volatility (Bollinger Middle)
- Why: The 20-period middle line provides a dynamic benchmark; combining with bands helps identify breakouts or reversals in context of current volatility.

8) atr
- Category: Volatility
- Why: Measures true market volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing; complements price/momentum signals with a volatility lens.

Notes and trade-context considerations
- This set covers trend (SMAs), momentum (MACD, RSI), and volatility/stop guidance (ATR, Bollinger middle). It avoids redundancy (for example, selecting both boll_ub and boll_lb isn’t necessary here; boll and atr plus a momentum suite give a balanced view).
- If you prefer fewer signals or want to emphasize volume, we could swap in vwma for a volume-confirmed trend signal instead of one of the moving averages, but the current 8-indicator mix already aims for broad coverage.
- Once data is available, I’ll generate a detailed trend report with:
  - Current directional bias from SMA relationships (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA, 50 above 200 indicating bullish trend, etc.)
  - MACD/macd signals and any divergence observations
  - RSI levels and potential reversals or continuation signals
  - Bollinger bands context (price touching bands, breakouts, or mean reversion in current volatility)
  - ATR-based volatility regime and suggested stop levels
  - VWMA considerations if we swap indicators later on
- Timeframe and look-back: daily data with a 15- to 30-day look-back can give a balanced view; for more tactical entries, we can shift to a shorter horizon (e.g., 10-15 days) if you want.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching data now and then provide a full, data-backed trend report with the 8 indicators above.
- Alternatively, tell me if you’d like me to:
  - Adjust the indicator set (e.g., keep MACD but drop one of the SMA indicators, or replace MACD with VWMA for volume-based confirmation)
  - Change the look-back period (e.g., 60 days for longer-term context)
  - Use a different date range (start_date and end_date) to align with a specific event window

Proposed output format once data is retrieved (example structure)
- Executive summary of META’s current trend
- Trend confirmation from SMA relationships (price vs 50/200, 50 vs 200)
- Momentum read from MACD and RSI with any divergences
- Volatility and breakout context from Bollinger middle and ATR
- Volume/price context if VWMA becomes part of the analysis
- Practical trading considerations (entry/exit ideas, risk management notes)
