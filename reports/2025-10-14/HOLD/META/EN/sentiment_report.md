I’m running into a tool issue on the Reddit stock-info fetch for META (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can’t retrieve the latest Reddit sentiment data right now. I can either retry the data fetch if you want me to attempt again, or proceed with a detailed, framework-based long report that outlines how I would analyze social sentiment, news, and implications for traders once the data feed is available. Below is a comprehensive framework and a sample report structure you can use. If you’d like, I can also fill in the analysis once the data fetch succeeds.

Planned approach (what I would deliver once data is available)
- Data sources:
  - Reddit stock threads and subreddits relevant to META (e.g., r/investing, r/stocks, r/WallStreetbets if applicable, r/technology, etc.)
  - Other social sentiment sources (X/Twitter, stock forums) if access is available
  - Company news (earnings, product announcements, regulatory developments)
  - Key macro/news drivers (advertising market trends, AI deployments, metaverse/capex updates, regulatory/regulatory-privacy news)

- Data analysis methodology:
  - Daily sentiment extraction: positive/negative/neutral counts, weighted by engagement (upvotes, comment volume)
  - Topic modeling: track focus areas (ads revenue, AI features, privacy, metaverse, regulatory risk, user growth, AR/VR hardware)
  - Sentiment momentum: compare day-over-day and week-over-week changes
  - Event tagging: flag days with major news and quantify sentiment impact
  - Correlation checks: relate sentiment swings to stock moves and key headlines

- Key sentiment and news drivers to monitor for META:
  - Ad revenue trends and monetization of Reels/short-form video
  - AI initiatives and performance (e.g., AI-driven products, ROI impact on ads, competitive positioning vs. peers)
  - Privacy/regulatory developments (EU/US privacy rules, data handling, advertising governance)
  - Platform changes (algorithms, feed changes, creator incentives)
  - Metaverse strategy and hardware investments (Reality Labs)
  - User growth/engagement metrics (MAUs, time spent, ARPU)
  - Financial health signals (earnings surprises, guidance revisions, CAPEX cadence)

- Trader-oriented insights and implications:
  - When sentiment shows rising optimism tied to AI or monetization milestones, expect potential near-term price strength, especially if accompanied by favorable earnings guidance.
  - Heightened negative sentiment around regulatory risks or ad-pacing constraints could precede pullbacks or increased volatility.
  - Divergence between sentiment momentum and price action may indicate a latent move (e.g., sentiment improves while price redistributes, or vice versa).

- Report structure and key findings sections:
  - Executive snapshot: high-level sentiment tone, major themes, and likely near-term risk/reward
  - Daily sentiment timeline: day-by-day sentiment scores and notable posts/headlines
  - Top topics and narratives: breakdown by topic and sentiment polarity
  - News-heat map: alignment (positive/negative) of recent headlines with sentiment shifts
  - Risk flags and catalysts: regulatory, competitive, or product-driven catalysts
  - Trading implications: short/medium-term guidance based on sentiment and news alignment
  - Data gaps and next steps: what data is missing and how it could alter the view

- Makrdown table: a ready-to-fill summary (end of the report)
  - The table will include per-day sentiment, top topics, notable headlines, and implied trader signals.

If you want me to proceed with the above once the data fetch works, I’ll generate a full, narrative-long report with actionable insights and a final Makrmarkdown table. In the meantime, here is a ready-to-fill template you can use immediately.

Proposed template for the long report
- Title: META (META) Social Sentiment, News, and Trading Implications — [Date Range]
- Executive snapshot
- Data sources and methodology
- Daily sentiment and topics (by day)
- Notable headlines and event impact
- Sentiment momentum and correlations with price
- Key risk factors and catalysts
- Trading implications and scenarios
- Limitations and data gaps
- Appendix: Method details and glossary

Makrdown table (to fill with data once available)
| Date | Platform / Source | Sentiment (Pos/Neu/Neg) | Top Topics / Keywords | Notable Headlines / Posts | Expected Market Impact | Confidence / Notes |
|------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| 2025-10-14 | Reddit (META) | Pos/Neu/Neg | AI, Ads, Privacy, Reels | Example headline or post summary | Bullish/Bearish signal with rationale | Data quality / gaps |
| 2025-10-13 | Reddit (META) | Pos/Neu/Neg | AI, Metaverse, User growth | … | … | … |
| 2025-10-12 | Reddit (META) | Pos/Neu/Neg | Ads monetization, regulatory risk | … | … | … |

Would you like me to:
A) Retry the Reddit data fetch now and then produce the full report with live data, or
B) Proceed with the detailed framework and a placeholder report structure (as above) so you can review the approach, and I’ll populate it once the data fetch succeeds?

If you prefer option A, I’ll reattempt the data retrieval immediately and then deliver the complete long-form report with the Makrmarkdown table appended. If you want option B now, I’ll generate a full, richly detailed framework and narrative immediately, ready to populate with data once the tool works again.
