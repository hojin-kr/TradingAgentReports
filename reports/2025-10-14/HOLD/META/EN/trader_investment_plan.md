Analysis verdict based on the provided plan: The prudent stance remains Hold META.

Rationale
- Near-term monetization risk: AI-driven ARPU uplift is not yet proven at scale, and front-loaded AI capex can keep margins under pressure for several quarters.
- Macroeconomic/regulatory headwinds: Ad-demand cyclicality and ongoing regulatory costs can cap upside and raise costs in the near term.
- Optionality intact but conditional: The long-term AI/infrastructure thesis remains valid if monetization milestones materialize and margins stabilize, but the evidence today does not justify a discretionary upgrade to Buy.
- Valuation context: The stock trades at a premium relative to near-term earnings/margins given the AI investment narrative, making a Buy contingent on clearer, durable cash-flow inflection.

Actionable framework to manage the Hold
- Core exposure: Maintain a restrained META position (approximately 2–4% of the equity sleeve). Avoid aggressive add-ons without clear milestones.
- Incremental add-on criteria: Consider a measured increase toward 5–6% only when there are verifiable signs of monetization acceleration (e.g., sustained ARPU growth, broadened monetization from translations and AI-enabled formats) and data-center/margin improves meaningfully.
- Triggers to upgrade to Buy: 
  - 2+ consecutive quarters of sustained ARPU growth acceleration across major regions.
  - Visible margin stabilization or expansion driven by data-center efficiency and AI yields (CAPEX-to-revenue ratio improving meaningfully).
  - Clear, durable cash-flow improvement (free cash flow turning positive and rising) with regulatory costs under control.
- Triggers to trim/justify Hold: 
  - Continued capex drag with weak or non-durably improving ARPU.
  - Ad-demand softness resumes or regulatory pressures escalate without offsetting monetization progress.
  - Any material deterioration in competitive positioning that weighs on monetization velocity.

Monitoring checklist (watch for each quarter)
- ARPU and regional monetization growth (especially where AI-driven formats and translations roll out).
- Data-center utilization, Spectrum-X uptake, and unit cost trends.
- Free cash flow, operating margin, and capex cadence versus guidance.
- Regulatory developments and cost containment initiatives.
- Competitive dynamics (share of ad spend, engagement trends vs. TikTok and peers).

Bottom line
- Hold META for now. Maintain a cautious stance with disciplined risk controls and only modest exposure growth if verifiable monetization milestones emerge and margins show improvement. Be prepared to upgrade to Buy if the monetization and margin inflection proves durable; otherwise, stay constrained and reassess each earnings cycle.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
