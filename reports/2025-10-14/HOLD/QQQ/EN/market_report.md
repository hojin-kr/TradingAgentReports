Thanks for your patience. I attempted to fetch QQQ data from Yahoo Finance to generate the indicator analysis, but the data retrieval step failed in the current environment (FileNotFoundError). I can still set up the indicator framework and provide you with a detailed plan. Once the data fetch succeeds, I will generate the full, data-driven report.

Selected indicators (8 total) with rationale for QQQ (Nasdaq-100, tech-heavy, volatile, growth-oriented):

1) close_10_ema
- Category: Moving Averages (short-term)
- Why: Captures quick shifts in momentum and can signal early entries or exits. Useful for a fast-moving tech index like QQQ where rapid sentiment changes are common.

2) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages (medium-term)
- Why: Provides a clearer view of the intermediate trend and can act as dynamic support/resistance. Helps filter noise from the ultra-short term.

3) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages (long-term)
- Why: Benchmarks the overall trend. Golden/death cross signals can indicate longer-term regime changes; good for context and risk budgeting.

4) macd
- Category: MACD
- Why: Measures momentum via EMA differences. Crossovers and divergences help spot potential trend changes in a high-volatility index like QQQ.

5) macds
- Category: MACD Signal
- Why: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with the MACD line provide clearer entry/exit signals when used with other filters.

6) macdh
- Category: MACD Histogram
- Why: Shows momentum strength and divergence potential. Helpful for early warning before MACD line crossovers.

7) rsi
- Category: Momentum
- Why: Identifies overbought/oversold levels and potential reversals. In strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated, so it’s best used with trend context from moving averages.

8) atr
- Category: Volatility
- Why: Quantifies market volatility to inform stop placement and position sizing. Critical for a sector-heavy index where base risk can spike quickly.

Notes on interpretation and usage plan (once data is available):
- Trend layering: Use the 10-EMA, 50-SMA, and 200-SMA together to classify market regime:
  - Uptrend: Price above 50-SMA and 200-SMA with 10-EMA above 50-SMA.
  - Downtrend: Price below 50-SMA and 200-SMA with 10-EMA below 50-SMA.
  - Sideways: Prices hover near the 50-SMA with mixed signals from the 10-EMA and price action.
  This helps you align trades with the prevailing trend and avoid counter-trend setups in choppy markets.

- Momentum confirmation: MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram should be considered together:
  - bullish momentum: MACD line crosses above the MACD Signal with positive histogram
  - bearish momentum: MACD line crosses below the MACD Signal with negative histogram
  Use these in conjunction with RSI to avoid over-reliance on a single momentum signal.

- RSI usage: Watch for overbought (above ~70) or oversold (below ~30) readings, but interpret within trend context.
  - In strong uptrends, RSI can remain elevated; look for bearish divergences or failure to make new highs as potential reversal signals, especially if MACD shows weakening momentum.

- Volatility management: ATR informs stop-loss placement and position sizing.
  - Higher ATR suggests wider stops and/or smaller position sizes; lower ATR allows tighter stops but may imply more frequent whipsaws.

- Volume/price context: While not in the current 8-indicator set, when available, consider adding VWMA (volume-weighted) to validate price movements with volume confirmation. If you want, I can add it as a ninth indicator when appropriate.

What I can deliver next (once the data fetch works):
- A detailed, data-driven trend report covering:
  - Current trend direction and strength across the three moving averages
  - MACD/MACD-Signal/MACD-Histogram reading and any crossovers/divergences
  - RSI level with interpretation in the latest price context
  - ATR-based volatility assessment and implications for risk management
  - Integrated narrative with potential entry/exit points and risk controls
- A concise trader’s short-list of potential setups aligned with the identified regime (e.g., trend-following entries on MACD crossovers with RSI confirmations, or cautious stance in high ATR markets).

Next steps:
- Retry data retrieval now or at a later time. If you’d like, I can try again immediately.
- If you have an alternative data source (CSV file of QQQ prices), you can provide it, and I’ll generate the full 8-indicator analysis from that data.
- I can also scale back to fewer indicators if you want a quicker, less data-intensive read.
