I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock data for QQQ on 2025-10-14, but I’m hitting an internal tool error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

It looks like the Reddit data tool is currently unavailable or misconfigured on the backend. I can proceed in a few ways:

Options to proceed
- Option 1: Retry now. I can try the Reddit data fetch again immediately to see if the error resolves.
- Option 2: Proceed with an interim, data-grounded analysis using all other accessible sources (e.g., recent headlines, general social sentiment on X/Twitter, StockTwits, Reddit outside of the tool, and public market commentary) while we wait for the Reddit tool to come back online.
- Option 3: Wait and retry later, then deliver a full, Reddit-informed report once the tool works again.

What I can deliver right now (without Reddit data)
- A comprehensive sentiment and news analysis focusing on QQQ (the ETF) over the past week, using:
  - Public headlines and major market news related to QQQ, Nasdaq-100, and broad market drivers.
  - Social sentiment signals from general online financial chatter not restricted to Reddit (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits, forums) if you approve me to pull them via available channels.
  - Any available data on volatility, volume, and price action for QQQ during the past week.
- A traders’ implications section with fine-grained takeaways (what catalysts to watch, potential scenarios, risk factors).
- A structured Markdown-table summary of key points at the end, to help you quickly skim the main signals and implications.

Important note about QQQ
- QQQ is an ETF tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, not a single company. Sentiment and news around QQQ often reflect broader tech and growth equity dynamics, sector concentration (tech, semiconductors, AI-related names), and macro factors (rates, liquidity, earnings season impact, geopolitical risk). The implications I provide will explicitly tie back to those drivers.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (Option 1)
- Proceed with an interim analysis using other sources (Option 2)
- Wait and retry later (Option 3)

If you choose Option 2, I’ll start assembling the interim report right away and share a detailed, trader-focused analysis plus the final Markdown table.
