Recommendation: Hold

Rationale
- The presented plan emphasizes that multiple near-term milestones (OpenAI/hyperscaler ramp, data-center margin expansion, ROCm ecosystem adoption) are not yet verifiably in place due to intermittent data signals. In the absence of confirmed data-center revenue growth and margin improvement, the upside remains contingent and potentially risky.
- Bear risks (execution delays, macro/policy headwinds, margin pressure) remain concrete and could erode near-term earnings visibility. A Hold preserves capital and optionality until verifiable progress appears.
- This stance aligns with prudent risk management: avoid adding exposure while conditions are uncertain, and be ready to upgrade on clear, verifiable signals or downgrade if risks intensify.

What to do now (per plan)
- Do not initiate new AMD long positions beyond existing exposure; if already long, consider stabilizing (trim to neutral rather than add) to manage risk.
- Maintain liquidity and consider small hedges if you’re concerned about downside, recognizing AI-cycle volatility.
- Use explicit triggers to upgrade to Buy only on verifiable milestones (sustained data-center revenue growth and margin expansion over at least two consecutive quarters, plus confirmatory AI compute demand signals). Downgrade to Sell on stalled data-center growth, unchanged or eroding margins, or deteriorating AI demand signals.
- Schedule a structured data review cadence (even if data is imperfect): monitor data-center bookings/mix indicators, guidance on ROCm ecosystem adoption, and macro/policy risk signals.

Data integration note
- I can retry the data pull now to populate the 8 indicators and present a data-backed upgrade case if constructive signals appear. If you’d like me to proceed with another data fetch to attempt an upgrade to Buy, say “retry data pull now,” and I’ll return with a refreshed, signal-driven rationale. If you prefer to stay qualitative for the moment, we proceed with the Hold framework and the triggers above.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
