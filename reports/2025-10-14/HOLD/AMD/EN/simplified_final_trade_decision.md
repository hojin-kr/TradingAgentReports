# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
HOLD AMD. Upside depends on AI demand, but near-term margins and execution risks are real. Data signals are unclear, so holding preserves optionality until verifiable milestones and margin improvements appear.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold. Confidence level: Medium.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term verifiability gap: The bull case relies on milestones (data-center ramp, ROCm adoption, margin gains) that arenâ€™t clearly verifiable with current data.
- Significant risks exist: Potential issues with margins, execution, and policy headwinds could dilute upside.
- Data signals are intermittent: Guardrails are needed; a staged upgrade approach is prudent rather than an immediate Buy.
- Maintains optionality: If verifiable progress and margin improvements show up, a Buy upgrade remains possible.

## Risks To Watch
- Execution risk: Ramp delays, integration challenges, and reliance on a few large customers.
- Demand risk: AI compute demand from OpenAI/hyperscalers may not translate into durable share gains or pricing power.
- Margin risk: Costs rise or AI ramp underperforms, squeezing margins.
- Policy/macroeconomic risk: Regulatory changes or macro weakness could hurt margins and demand.
- Data signal risk: Intermittent data limits confidence in milestones; misreading signals could hurt timing.
