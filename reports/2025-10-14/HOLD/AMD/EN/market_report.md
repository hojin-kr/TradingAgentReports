I attempted to fetch AMD data and run indicators, but I hit a data-access error (FileNotFoundError) when querying the data source. I can retry or proceed with a qualitative framework now and then rerun the calculations once the data fetch succeeds. Tell me if you’d prefer I retry immediately or proceed with the analysis as a data-absent scenario.

Selected indicators (up to 8) for AMD, to give complementary, non-redundant insights:
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for AMD right now
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Provide medium- to long-term trend context. AMD often moves with the broader semiconductor cycle; 50s help identify intermediate trend direction, while 200s help confirm whether the stock is in a longer-term uptrend or downtrend. Crossovers (e.g., 50 above 200) can signal potential regime shifts.
- close_10_ema: Captures short-term momentum shifts and potential entry/exit points. Useful to spot faster reactions to news, earnings, or product-cycle updates that AMD frequently experiences.
- macd, macds, macdh: Together give momentum and trend-change signals. MACD line crossovers with MACD signal, divergence with price, and histogram changes help confirm or warn of trend strength or weakness.
- rsi: Momentum gauge to identify overbought/oversold levels and potential reversals. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated; in choppier periods, RSI cues become more actionable when aligned with trend signals.
- atr: Volatility terrain that helps with risk management (stop placement, position sizing). AMD can swing on earnings or supply-chain news, so ATR helps calibrate risk without relying on price direction alone.

Nuanced trend framework for AMD (without current numeric data)
- Trend direction: Use price relative to the 50 and 200 SMAs:
  - If price remains above both SMAs and the 50SMA is above the 200SMA, the context favors a bullish drift, with pullbacks potentially finding support near the 50SMA or the 200SMA as dynamic floors.
  - If price is below both SMAs, or if the 50SMA crosses below the 200SMA (death cross), expect a more cautious or bearish regime unless momentum signals diverge positively.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD crossovers and histogram behavior should align with price action:
  - A bullish MACD crossover (MACD line crossing above MACD signal) with price above the 50/200 SMAs strengthens a continuation or a new up leg.
  - Bearish MACD crossovers should be treated as risk signals, especially if price is near key support.
- Short-term momentum: 10 EMA with RSI helps time entries and exits:
  - If the price trades above the 10 EMA and RSI is not at extreme overbought levels, there could be room for a short-term tilt higher, particularly if MACD momentum supports it.
  - RSI divergence (e.g., price making new highs while RSI fails to follow) can flag potential reversals even in uptrends.
- Volatility and risk management: Use ATR to set stops and adapt position sizing:
  - Higher ATR values imply wider stops; lower ATR allows tighter risk controls. In AMD’s volatile environment around earnings or product-cycle announcements, ATR-based sizing can keep risk in check.
- Overbought/oversold context: RSI levels around 70/30:
  - In uptrends, RSI can remain above 70 for extended periods; watch for bearish divergence or RSI dropping toward 50-60 before committing to new long entries.
  - In downtrends, RSI near 30 can reflect oversold conditions but should be confirmed by price action and MACD momentum to avoid catching downward spikes.

Actionable signal framework (how to interpret signals once data is available)
- Bullish setup if:
  - price above 50SMA and 200SMA, 50SMA rising toward 200SMA (or a golden cross),
  - MACD line crosses above MACD signal and histogram turns positive,
  - RSI climbs from mid-range and stays above 40-50,
  - ATR rising but not at extreme disruption, indicating sustainable momentum with controlled risk.
- Bearish setup if:
  - price above/below SMAs in a way that suggests a regime shift (e.g., price failing to sustain above the 50SMA after testing it, or a death cross),
  - MACD crosses below and histogram turns negative,
  - RSI breaks below 50 or makes lower highs while price trends lower,
  - ATR increases sharply with price weakness, signaling rising volatility and potential stop-outs.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the AMD data and compute these indicators as soon as the data source is accessible again. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry the data pull with a different date window (e.g., shorter recent window) or a fresh data source,
  - Or proceed with the qualitative analysis now and update with precise indicator values once data is retrieved.

Markdown table of key points
- Indicates how each indicator contributes to AMD analysis and the intended interpretation once data is available.

| Indicator | Purpose | What to look for | AMD-specific notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Trend direction / dynamic support-resistance | Price above/below 50SMA; 50SMA trending up/down | Helps gauge medium-term trend in AMD’s cyclical semis environment |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above/below 200SMA; 50SMA above/below 200SMA (golden/death cross) | Critical for strategic bias; AMD often influenced by macro semicon cycles |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum shifts | Price crossing above/below 10EMA; proximity of price to 10EMA | Quick entry/exit timing; care in choppy markets |
| macd | Momentum and trend-change signal | MACD line crossing MACD signal; histogram growth/decay | Confirms or conflicts with price-driven moves; use with other filters |
| macds | MACD signal line smoothing | Crossover with MACD; alignment with MACD histogram | Helps reduce false positives from MACD alone |
| macdh | Momentum strength visualization | Histogram expansion/contraction; divergence with price | Early momentum cues; watch for reversals when diverging from price | 
| rsi | Momentum / overbought-oversold | RSI near 70/30; bullish/bearish divergences | In uptrends, watch for overextension; in downtrends, look for reversals near 30-40 |
| atr | Volatility & risk management | Higher ATR implies wider stops; lower ATR allows tighter risk | Adjust position sizing and stop placement for AMD’s earnings-driven moves |

If you want me to retry data retrieval now, tell me to proceed with another fetch attempt, and I’ll run the indicators again once the data source responds.
