I hit an issue fetching live data for NFLX with the current tool setup (FileNotFoundError from get_YFin_data). I can’t generate the exact indicator values right now. If you’d like, I can retry shortly or proceed with a purely strategic qualitative analysis using the chosen indicator set and explain how to interpret them once data is available. Below is a detailed plan with the eight most complementary indicators I’d use for NFLX in a typical mid- to short-term trading context, along with how to read them together. I’ve kept the set focused on distinct insights (trend, momentum, and volatility) without redundancy.

 Selected indicators (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
 - close_50_sma
 - close_200_sma
 - close_10_ema
 - macd
 - macds
 - macdh
 - rsi
 - atr

 Rationale for indicator choices
 - close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
   - What it provides: A mid-term trend benchmark and a dynamic support/resistance reference.
   - How to use: Look for price crosses of the 50 SMA, and use the 50 SMA as a guide for pullbacks in uptrends or as a ceiling in downtrends.
   - NFLX context: If price sits above the 50 SMA and holds, it suggests a constructive intermediate trend; a break below can signal a potential acceleration of a correction or consolidation.

 - close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
   - What it provides: A long-term trend anchor; commonly watched for golden/death cross signals.
   - How to use: Confirm the longer-term trend direction; use crossovers with the price or with the 50 SMA to gauge regime shifts.
   - NFLX context: A clear price above the 200 SMA with a rising slope tends to favor bulls; persistent closings below the 200 SMA can indicate regime risk or a shift to a bearish stance.

 - close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
   - What it provides: A responsive short-term momentum ruler; helps detect quick shifts in price action.
   - How to use: Observe crossovers of price or of longer SMAs with the 10 EMA; use as a trigger for faster-entry opportunities, but filter with longer-term trends.
   - NFLX context: When the 10 EMA crosses above major SMAs or price stabilizes above the 10 EMA after a pullback, it can hint at near-term bullish momentum.

 - macd (MACD line)
   - What it provides: Momentum and trend-change signals via the difference of two EMAs.
   - How to use: Watch for MACD line crossings above/below zero and crossovers with its signal; confirm with other indicators to reduce false signals in choppy markets.
   - NFLX context: Positive MACD and rising histogram support a bullish momentum tilt; negative MACD/histogram can warn of deterioration.

 - macds (MACD Signal)
   - What it provides: The smoothed signal line used to validate MACD crossovers.
   - How to use: Use MACD vs MACD Signal crossovers as trade triggers; not standalone—should be corroborated by price action and trend indicators.
   - NFLX context: A MACD crossing above its signal with price strength strengthens entry validity; crossing below signals potential downside or risk-off moves.

 - macdh (MACD Histogram)
   - What it provides: Momentum strength and divergence visualization between MACD and its signal.
   - How to use: Positive histogram indicates bullish momentum, negative indicates bearish momentum; track histogram expansion/contraction for momentum shifts.
   - NFLX context: An expanding positive histogram amid rising prices reinforces a strong up-move; a shrinking or negative histogram amid gains can warn of waning momentum.

 - rsi (RSI)
   - What it provides: Momentum gauge showing overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences.
   - How to use: Typical 70/30 thresholds; look for bullish/bearish divergences with price; consider trend context to avoid misreads in strong trends.
   - NFLX context: RSI rising toward 70 in a strong uptrend can be healthy if price supports the move; RSI near or beyond 70 in a peak phase may warn of a pullback.

 - atr (Average True Range)
   - What it provides: A measure of volatility magnitude; helps with risk management and position sizing.
   - How to use: Use ATR to set dynamic stop distances and adjust risk per trade; higher ATR means wider stops, lower ATR supports tighter risk controls.
   - NFLX context: Spikes in ATR often accompany earnings or major news; use ATR to avoid tighten-stops during high-volatility periods and to scale risk appropriately.

 How to interpret these indicators together (typical scenarios)
 - Bullish alignment
   - Price above 50 SMA and above 200 SMA, with 10 EMA above price/near price, MACD line above zero and rising, MACDH positive and expanding, RSI in a healthy upwards range (e.g., 40–70, not overbought), ATR elevated but not exploding.
   - Trading takeaway: Favor entries on pullbacks toward the 10 EMA or test of the 50 SMA as support, with stop-losss sized using the ATR. Position sizing can reflect the current volatility regime.

 - Bearish alignment
   - Price below 50 SMA and below 200 SMA, 10 EMA trending lower, MACD negative with a degrading histogram, RSI near or below 40, ATR rising (volatility increasing with downside risk).
   - Trading takeaway: Look for breakdown-confirmation opportunities or rallies into resistance zones (50/200 SMA, prior support) to enter shorts or reduce long exposure. Use ATR-based stops to account for volatility.

 - Range-bound/consolidation
   - Price oscillating between 50 SMA and 200 SMA, MACD flat, RSI hovering near midrange, ATR subdued or periodically spiking on headlines.
   - Trading takeaway: Favor mean-reversion strategies with tighter risk controls; consider waiting for a decisive breakout or breakdown confirmed by MACD cross or RSI re-acceleration.

 Next steps and data request
 - I attempted to fetch NFLX data and calculate these indicators, but the data retrieval failed due to a backend FileNotFoundError. If you’d like, I can:
   - Retry the data fetch now, or
   - Proceed with a qualitative interpretation based on typical NFLX behavior in this setup, and then re-run once data is available to provide exact current readings.

 Markdown table: Key indicators, what they measure, and how to interpret for NFLX
 Indicator | What it measures | How to use for NFLX | Typical interpretation in NFLX context
 - close_50_sma | 50-day trend/mid-term support-resistance | Price cross of 50 SMA; use as dynamic support/resistance with trend confirmation | Above 50 SMA: potential bullish bias; below: potential bearish bias
 - close_200_sma | 200-day trend/long-term direction | Long-term trend confirmation; watch for golden/death cross with other signals | Above 200 SMA: long-term bullish context; below: potential long-term weakness
 - close_10_ema | Short-term momentum and quick shifts | Quick entry/exit triggers; filter with longer-term trend | 10 EMA rise near price can signal near-term upside; break below may precede continued downside
 - macd | Momentum and trend-change signal (MACD line) | Crosses with MACD Signal; zero-line position as trend alignment | MACD above zero and rising: bullish momentum; MACD below zero: bearish momentum
 - macds | MACD signal line (smoothing) | Crossovers with MACD for trade triggers | MACD cross above MACD Signal = potential buy signal; cross below = potential sell signal
 - macdh | MACD histogram (momentum strength) | Momentum strength and divergence visualization | Expanding positive histogram supports up-moves; expanding negative histogram signals protection or reversal risk
 - rsi | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | Readability of overbought/oversold conditions; watch for divergences | RSI rising toward 70 in uptrends can be healthy; sharp moves to overbought with divergence can warn of a pullback
 - atr | Volatility magnitude and risk management | Use for stop placement and position sizing; adapt to volatility regime | Rising ATR means wider stops; low ATR allows tighter risk controls; spikes often around earnings/news

If you’d like, I can:
- Retry get_YFin_data for NFLX now and then compute the eight indicators, or
- Proceed with a hypothetical example using assumed readings to illustrate how to trade NFLX under current market context, clearly marking it as illustrative until real data is available.

Would you prefer me to retry data retrieval now, or proceed with the illustrative scenario while we wait for the data fetch to succeed?
