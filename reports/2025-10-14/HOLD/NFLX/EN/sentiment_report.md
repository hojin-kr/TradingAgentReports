Thanks for your patience. I’m seeing a tool error when trying to fetch Reddit stock info for NFLX on 2025-10-14: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). I’ve retried several times, and the issue persists, which likely means the data source or the tool endpoint is currently unavailable.

Here are your options to move forward:

Option A: Retry and fetch data when the tool is available
- I can keep attempting to pull the Reddit sentiment data for NFLX for the past week (daily granularity) and then deliver the full long-form analysis with a daily sentiment breakdown, notable posts, and inferred sentiment trends, plus the latest news.
- If the tool comes back online, I’ll produce the comprehensive report and a Markdown table with key takeaways.

Option B: Use alternative data sources or methods right away
- I can provide a detailed qualitative analysis based on publicly available signals (news headlines, general social sentiment signals, and notable public statements) and outline a framework for traders without the exact day-by-day Reddit data.
- If you have other data sources you want me to pull (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, news feeds, or you can provide links to Reddit threads), I can analyze those and still deliver a thorough report with daily sentiment approximations.

Option C: Proactively prepare a thorough report framework now
- I can prepare a complete, ready-to-fill analysis framework: sections on social sentiment by day, key catalysts, risk factors, price-action correlation, and a final verdict for traders. Once the Reddit data is available, I’ll plug in the actual numbers and post-event notes and append the Markdown table.

What would you like to do?
- If you want me to keep trying the Reddit data fetch, I’ll continue retrying and notify you as soon as it succeeds.
- If you prefer, I can switch to Option B or C and deliver the rest now, then update with data when the tool becomes available.
