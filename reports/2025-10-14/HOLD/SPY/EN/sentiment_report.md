Sorry about that — the Reddit stock info tool failed with a FileNotFoundError when I tried to fetch SPY data for 2025-10-14.

I can proceed in one of two ways:
- Retry the Reddit data pull now (same parameters: SPY, 2025-10-14).
- Or switch to broader sentiment and news sources (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits, Reddit via other channels, major news headlines) to build a comprehensive week-long sentiment and news report.

Which would you prefer? If you want me to retry now, I’ll run the Reddit fetch again immediately. If you’d rather I proceed with broader sources, I’ll collect and synthesize sentiment from those sources for the past week (roughly 2025-10-07 to 2025-10-14) and prepare the long-form report with insights and a final Markdown table.
