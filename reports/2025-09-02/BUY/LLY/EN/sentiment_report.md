Although the social media data was limited and specific posts were not identified, notable days like Women's Equality Day (August 26) and National Bow Tie Day (August 28) may have indirectly influenced discussions around corporate responsibility or community engagements. Companies like Eli Lilly may also use such occasions to showcase their commitment to equality and community support, even if specific posts were not tracked.
