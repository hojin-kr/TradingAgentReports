## Comprehensive Report on Current Global Economic Trends (September 2, 2025)

### **1. Overview of Macroeconomic Conditions**
Over the past week, significant macroeconomic developments have emerged affecting global markets. The most notable trends indicate a rebound in European manufacturing alongside ongoing struggles in key Asian economies. Additionally, the global financial landscape is being shaped by expectations regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate policies amid geopolitical tensions and fluctuating market sentiment.

#### **European Manufacturing Rebounds**
- The Eurozone's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has risen to 50.7, signaling the first manufacturing expansion since mid-2022. This improvement is largely attributed to robust domestic demand from nations like Greece and Spain, which offset challenges posed by ongoing tariffs from the United States. Germany's sector is contracting at a slower pace than before, reflecting broader positive trends.
- Contrarily, Asian manufacturing remains under pressure, with Japan and South Korea recording PMIs below the critical threshold of 50, indicating continued contraction. China's manufacturing sector showed a mixed picture, with some private sector indicators suggesting growth but official data still chillingly pointing to contraction.

#### **Market Reactions to U.S. Federal Reserve Policies**
- Global financial markets are experiencing fluctuations driven by anticipated interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve, potentially dropping rates by 50 basis points. As a result, the U.S. dollar has weakened, reaching nearly five-week lows. In contrast, gold prices surged to a record high of $3,503.32 per ounce.
- Investors are closely monitoring upcoming U.S. employment data, particularly the non-farm payroll reports, which are vital for determining the Fed's future policy moves.

#### **Geopolitical and Political Risks**
- Markets are entering September with increased caution due to several global risks:
  - Domestic U.S. tensions following recent actions by President Trump, including the dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, raising concerns about the central bank's independence.
  - Risks in the Eurozone following a no-confidence vote threat against the French Prime Minister.
  - Ongoing geopolitical tensions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, creating volatility in bond markets and fluctuating oil prices.

### **2. Updates on Eli Lilly (LLY)**
Eli Lilly, a significant player in the pharmaceutical sector, has experienced a surge in stock behavior due to its advancements in obesity treatment and positive trial results.

#### **Key Developments:**
- **Obesity Pill Approval**: Eli Lilly is repositioning itself for approval of its oral weight loss pill, orforglipron, which recently passed critical Phase 3 trials. This has led to analysts upgrading the stock’s rating — HSBC upgraded LLY to "Hold" with a price target of $700, with sentiment leaning toward LLY being a strong long-term hold.
- **Stock Performance**: Eli Lilly shares rose sharply, more than 4%, on news of successful trials for its obesity drug. The company's stock price is currently observed around $732 amid increased attention from analysts and investors.
- **Sales and Revenue**: With Q2 revenue hitting $15.6 billion (a 38% increase year-over-year), driven largely by strong sales from its diabetes and weight-loss product lines, Eli Lilly's performance in the market reflects both a strong product pipeline and investor sentiment.

### **3. Broader Market Reflections**
- Investors seem cautious as September historically tends to be a bearish month for stocks, notably represented by the MSCI World Index's historical performance.
- Bond market activity remains under scrutiny as U.S., Japanese, and German governments face pressure to engage investors amid rising yields.

### **4. Conclusion and Market Implications**
The mixed signals from manufacturing indicators, coupled with the anticipated policy shifts by central banks, indicate a potentially volatile trading environment in the coming weeks. For Eli Lilly, the successful advancement of its obesity treatments could provide substantial momentum moving forward, positioning it against competitors.
