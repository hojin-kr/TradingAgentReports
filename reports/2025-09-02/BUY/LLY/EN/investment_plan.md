# Investment Plan

Here’s how I see it after weighing both cases:

On the bull side you have truly impressive top-line momentum—a 38 percent year-over-year revenue gain to $15.6 billion, driven by diabetes franchises and a blockbuster in the making with Mounjaro’s obesity results. That plus orforglipron’s pending approval gives Lilly a strong shot at a slice of the $75 billion weight-loss market. Their $6 billion-a-year R&D engine, solid balance sheet and brand legacy in diabetes and oncology point to sustained innovation. Add in the prospect of Fed rate cuts and renewed global consumer spending, and you have a credible path to high-teens earnings growth over the next few years.

On the bear side the main worries are market saturation for diabetes drugs, rising generic competition and outcomes risk if new therapies stumble in uptake or regulation. The technical picture looks weak—LLY trading below its 50- and 200-day moving averages, negative MACD readings and that sense of market indecision reflected by an RSI around 53. But these indicators have often flashed early “sells” before big approvals or earnings beats reversed course.

I’m siding with the bull. Fundamentally this company is in the sweet spot of healthcare innovation right now, and I’ve learned from past mistakes—when I’ve bailed out of growth stories too early, I missed the real run-up. Lilly’s pipeline isn’t just hype; it’s delivering revenue today and has clear catalysts on the horizon. Volatility will persist, but I’d rather own the shares into those events than stand on the sidelines.

So here’s the plan:

1. Recommendation: BUY LLY.  
2. Rationale: Robust, diversified pipeline; sizable addressable market in diabetes and obesity; strong free cash flow and R&D commitment; Fed policy support; history of outperformance post-FDA approvals. Short-term technical noise doesn’t outweigh structural growth.  
3. Strategic Actions:  
   – Establish a core position equal to 2–3 percent of portfolio capital.  
   – Use staggered limit orders to average in around recent support levels (e.g., $720–730).  
   – Place an initial protective stop about 12 percent below entry to limit downside while giving the shares room to breathe.  
   – Monitor key catalysts: Mounjaro label expansion, orforglipron approval decision, quarterly sales updates. Adjust position size up to 4 percent on positive news or trim to 1–1.5 percent on clear setbacks.  
   – Review the trade quarterly rather than reacting intraday to volatility.  

I’m committing to patience here. LLY’s current pullback looks like an opportunity to me, not a signal to sell. Let’s buy into the story now, stay disciplined with stops, and revisit as the data rolls in.
