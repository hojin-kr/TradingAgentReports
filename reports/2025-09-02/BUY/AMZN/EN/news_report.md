## Current State of the World: Macroeconomic and Trading Insights (Week of August 26 - September 2, 2025)

### **Macroeconomic Developments**

#### 1. **Impact of U.S. Tariffs on Asian Economies**
The U.S. has imposed increased tariffs on a variety of Asian nations, leading to a marked contraction in manufacturing activities in countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Meanwhile, China reported a slight growth in its manufacturing PMI, indicating a complex interplay of economic impulses in the region. Continued tariffs and decreasing exports pose threats to Asia's economic recovery, warranting close monitoring by traders.

#### 2. **U.S. Court Ruling on Tariffs**
A recent U.S. Court ruling deemed that former President Trump's tariffs were beyond his executive powers, although further appeals could arise. This has resulted in increased uncertainty in global markets, particularly affecting businesses linked to trade.

#### 3. **Anticipation of Federal Reserve Rate Cuts**
Expectations of a potential 50 basis-point cut in U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates have weakened the dollar, pushing gold prices up to record highs. Upcoming U.S. labor market data will be critical, as traders await clarity on monetary policy shifts amid a backdrop of economic fluctuations.

#### 4. **Political Unrest in Indonesia**
Increased protests in Indonesia triggered a noticeable decline in the IDX Composite, with significant impacts on the Indonesian currency. Add to this the intervention by the Bank of Indonesia to stabilize the rupiah; these factors shed light on the geopolitical risks associated with trading in emerging markets.

#### 5. **Gold and Oil Price Market Movements**
Gold prices have surged, driven by safe-haven demand and expectations of a looser monetary policy. Meanwhile, oil prices experienced volatility due to supply concerns linked to Middle East disruptions and OPEC+ actions, with Brent crude rising above $79 per barrel.

### **Amazon (AMZN) Related Developments**

Amazon continues to play an integral role in both e-commerce and technological landscapes, with key points of interest as follows:

#### 1. **Labor Day Sales and Economic Impact**
Amazon's Labor Day sales feature significant discounts across a multitude of categories, with reports of high traffic for tech products, which indicates robust consumer interest and spending even amid economic uncertainty.

#### 2. **Investment in AWS**
Amazon has announced plans to invest approximately $4.4 billion in new data centers in New Zealand. This commitment reinforces its competitive position within the cloud computing market, which shows signs of high growth potential amid an expanding internet infrastructure demand.

#### 3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**
Amazon is facing legal challenges regarding consumer rights associated with purchased digital content on its platforms, which has implications for its digital services market. Investors should stay informed about how these developments may affect Amazon's operational integrity and stock performance.

### **Global Economic Trends**

- **GDP Growth and Economic Stabilization**: The global economy, particularly Brazil and the U.S., shows signs of recovery, with Brazil posting a 5.7% GDP increase in Q1 and the U.S. growing 3.3% in Q2 2025. Such growth dynamics can influence market trends and consumer sentiment positively.
  
- **Gold Prices Hitting Record Highs**: Driven by fears of recession and the weakening dollar, gold continues to rise. Traders need to consider gold as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuation risks.
