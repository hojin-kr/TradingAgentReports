I have thoroughly evaluated the proposed investment plan for UBER, taking into account the key points from both the Bull Analyst and the Bear Analyst. After careful consideration, I concur with the recommendation to **SELL**.

My reasoning is based on the following factors:

1. **Ongoing Bearish Momentum**: The 50-day SMA suggests ongoing bearish momentum, which outweighs the positive trend indicators.
2. **Increasing Competition**: The rise of Chinese players like Didi Chuxing and Byd poses significant competition to Uber's ride-hailing business.
3. **Regulatory Challenges**: Uber's efforts to navigate complex regulatory landscapes come at a cost, investing heavily in its autonomous driving technology. This may further exacerbate the challenges posed by global trade tensions.
4. **Autonomous Driving Risks**: While self-driving cars have potential benefits, they also pose significant risks in terms of liability, cybersecurity, and public acceptance.

Considering these factors, I strongly believe that investing in UBER at this time is not justified. The potential risks outweigh the potential rewards, and it's essential to prioritize caution and prudence when making investment decisions.

**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
