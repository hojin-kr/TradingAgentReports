I have carefully reviewed the proposed investment plan and considered both sides of the debate. Based on my analysis, I agree with the Bull Analyst's stance that AFRM is a compelling investment opportunity.

After reviewing the key points presented by both analysts, I am particularly impressed by the Bull Analyst's in-depth understanding of AFRM's growth potential, its partnership with XBio Therapeutics, and its commitment to innovation and expansion. The Bull Analyst's argument that the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes will have a positive impact on growth-oriented stocks like AFRM is well-reasoned and supported by concrete data points.

However, I do take note of the Bear Analyst's concerns about biotech risks and global economic trends. While these are valid considerations, I believe the Bull Analyst has effectively addressed these concerns and presented a more compelling argument for investing in AFRM.

Given my past experiences, I have learned to be cautious when investing in biotech stocks, but I also recognize the importance of being proactive and taking calculated risks. In this case, I believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks, and I am willing to take a bullish stance on AFRM.

**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY**
