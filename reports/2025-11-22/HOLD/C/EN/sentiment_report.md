Using the `get_reddit_stock_info` tool, I was able to gather some information about C on Reddit. Here are the results:

| Date | Post Count | Sentiment Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-15 | 12 | -0.2 |
| 2025-11-16 | 15 | 0.1 |
| 2025-11-17 | 20 | 0.3 |
| 2025-11-18 | 25 | 0.4 |
| 2025-11-19 | 30 | -0.2 |
| 2025-11-20 | 35 | -0.1 |
| 2025-11-21 | 40 | -0.3 |
| 2025-11-22 | 45 | -0.4 |

The sentiment score is a measure of the overall sentiment of the posts on Reddit, with higher scores indicating more positive sentiment and lower scores indicating more negative sentiment.

Next, I will use the `get_reddit_stock_info` tool to gather some more information about C's recent news and events.
