## FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY/HOLD/SELL
Based on the analysis of the indicators provided, here is a proposed transaction plan for C:

### Technical Analysis:
The short-term trend is up with some pullbacks and volatility in the market.

*   Close_50_sma (50 SMA) has been above 80 since November 10th. This suggests that the current uptrend may be sustainable.
*   RSI values indicate a slight oversold condition on November 11th, but they have been increasing since then, indicating potential buying opportunities at higher prices.
*   Bollinger Middle (BB) has been steadily rising and is currently near the upper band. This could suggest that we are entering overbought territory or an impending correction.

### Risk Management:
Considering the overall market trend, it seems appropriate to maintain a long-term position with stop-loss levels set at around 20% ATR below the current price level. A possible short position might be taken if the Bollinger Middle (BB) falls below its lower band and stays there for an extended period.

### Transaction Plan:
1.  **Buy**: If Close\_50\_sma rises above 85, considering a buy order with a target of $100.
2.  **HOLD**: Keep holding positions as long as RSI values remain above 50.
3.  **Sell**: Consider selling at around 20% ATR below the current price level if Bollinger Middle (BB) drops below its lower band and stays there for an extended period.
