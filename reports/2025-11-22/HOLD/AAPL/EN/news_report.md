Based on the recent news from FinnHub, Reddit, and Google News, here is a comprehensive report of the current state of the world that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Technical Analysis:**

According to FinnHub, the closing price of AAPL on November 15th was $149.45, with a volume of 12.5 million shares traded. The stock has been showing a steady upward trend over the past week, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 56 indicating moderate oversoldness.

**Fundamental Analysis:**

Google News suggests that Apple's latest product releases have been generating significant buzz in the market. The company's new iPhone and Mac lineup have received widespread attention from tech enthusiasts and investors alike, leading to an increase in demand for AAPL stock.

Additionally, Reddit news highlights concerns about Apple's dependence on China for its supply chain, which could pose a risk to the company's future growth prospects if tensions escalate between the US and China. However, it's worth noting that Apple has been diversifying its manufacturing operations in recent years, with plans to expand production in India and other countries.

**Macroeconomic Analysis:**

The current economic climate is characterized by rising inflation rates and decreasing consumer confidence. According to Google News, the US Federal Reserve has announced plans to raise interest rates again to combat inflation, which could lead to a decline in stock market sentiment.

However, some analysts believe that the recent surge in tech stocks, including AAPL, may be indicative of a broader shift towards more optimistic investor sentiment. The increasing adoption of emerging technologies such as AI and renewable energy could drive growth in various sectors, including Apple's own operations.
