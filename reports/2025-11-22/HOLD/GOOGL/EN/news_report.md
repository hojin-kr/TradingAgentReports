**Finnhub News:**

According to Finnhub, over the past week, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) has seen a mixed bag of news. On November 15th, Alphabet reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, with revenue growing by 8% year-over-year. However, this positive report was tempered by a decrease in advertising revenue, which accounted for the majority of the company's profits.

On November 18th, Finnhub reported that Google's CEO Sundar Pichai testified before the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform, addressing concerns over the company's market dominance and potential antitrust issues. While Pichai acknowledged some concerns, he also emphasized Google's commitment to innovation and competition.

More recently, on November 21st, Finnhub highlighted a report from The Wall Street Journal that Alphabet is planning to spin off its hardware business, including Pixel smartphones and Chromebooks, into a separate company. This move would focus Alphabet on its core advertising business and allow for more efficient resource allocation.

**Reddit News:**

On Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, traders have been discussing the potential impact of the US Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on interest rates. With inflation concerns still looming, some believe the Fed may raise interest rates to combat inflation. Others argue that a rate cut would be more likely, citing the strong labor market and rising consumer spending.

On r/investing, investors have been debating the performance of Alphabet stock (GOOGL) in light of the company's recent earnings report. While some see the decrease in advertising revenue as a temporary setback, others believe it signals a larger trend and are recommending a more cautious approach to investing.

**Analysis:**
