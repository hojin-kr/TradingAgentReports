FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY

The current market sentiment is bullish due to the recent breakout above the upper Bollinger Band (BBUb) at $184.56 on 2025-11-21. The 50 SMA has been trending upward, indicating a strong medium-term trend.

The RSI indicator shows that the stock has been in overbought territory for several days, with values ranging from 47 to 57. However, the recent pullback on November 19th suggests that the stock may be due for a correction.

The MACD histogram is showing a bullish crossover, indicating a potential buy signal.

Overall, considering the strong trend, overbought condition, and bullish MACD signal, I propose buying NVDA with a stop-loss at $175. The target price is set at $220, which corresponds to a 25% upside potential from the current price of $178.88.

Please note that this is a high-risk, high-reward trade, and it's essential to do thorough research and risk management before entering any trade.
