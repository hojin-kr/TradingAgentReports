FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the analysis of the indicators, it appears that BRK.B is in a stable position with a long-term trend confirming the overall market direction.

The 50 SMA indicates a medium-term trend direction and serves as dynamic support/resistance. The current value is not available due to lack of trading days.

The 200 SMA confirms the overall market trend and identifies golden/death cross setups, indicating that BRK.B is in a stable position with a long-term upward trend.

The Bollinger Middle shows a dynamic benchmark for price movement, acting as a basis for Bollinger Bands. The current value is not available due to lack of trading days.

Given the stable position of BRK.B, I propose holding the stock with a long-term perspective.

**Key Points:**

*   Lack of trading data makes it difficult to analyze some indicators.
*   BRK.B's 200 SMA confirms a long-term upward trend.
*   Bollinger Middle provides a dynamic benchmark for price movement.
*   The stock is in a stable position, indicating a buy and hold strategy with a long-term perspective.

**Recommendation:** Hold BRK.B with a long-term perspective.
