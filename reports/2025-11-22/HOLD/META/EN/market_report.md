Based on the stock data retrieved for META from 2025-11-22 to 2025-11-22, I recommend a neutral stance with a slight bullish bias.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Increasing Trend:** The closing price has been consistently increasing over the past few days, indicating a bullish trend.
2. **Price Resistance:** The high price on November 21st ($598.12) suggests that META might be facing resistance at this level. A successful breakout above this price could lead to further upward momentum.

2. `macd`: The MACD line is above the signal line, suggesting a bullish momentum.
3. `boll_ub`: The upper Bollinger Band is at $605.41, indicating potential overbought conditions.

**Risk Management:**

2. **Position Sizing**: Adjust position sizes based on current market volatility using the ATR (Average True Range) indicator.
