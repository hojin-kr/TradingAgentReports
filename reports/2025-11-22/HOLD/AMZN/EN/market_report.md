FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the analysis, I propose the following strategy:

**Short-term Trend Analysis (15 days)**

* The 10 EMA (close_10_ema) is currently below the close price, indicating a bearish trend. However, it's essential to consider other indicators for confirmation.
* The RSI (rsi) is at 60, indicating overbought conditions. A pullback in volume and a decrease in RSI could provide an entry opportunity.

**Long-term Trend Analysis (200 days)**

* The 200 SMA (close_200_sma) is above the close price, confirming the overall bearish trend.
* The MACD (macd) has been increasing, indicating a potential golden cross setup. However, it's crucial to wait for confirmation from other indicators.

**Volume-Based Analysis**

* ATR (atr) is at 2.5, indicating moderate volatility. This could provide an opportunity to adjust position sizes and set stop-loss levels.

**Strategic Recommendation**

Given the mixed signals, I recommend a cautious approach:

1. **Wait for confirmation**: Monitor the MACD's signal line crossovers and look for divergences between the MACD line and the close price.
2. **Look for volume spikes**: Wait for a pullback in volume to provide an entry opportunity when RSI is below 50.
3. **Adjust position sizes**: Use ATR to adjust position sizes based on current market volatility.
4. **Set stop-loss levels**: Set stop-loss levels below the recent low to limit potential losses.

**Buy/Sell/Hold Recommendation**

Based on the analysis, I recommend holding AMZN for now and waiting for confirmation from other indicators before making any trading decisions.

| Indicator | Value | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| close_10_ema | Below close price | Bearish trend |
| rsi | 60 (Overbought) | Potential entry opportunity |
| close_200_sma | Above close price | Confirming overall bearish trend |
| macd | Increasing | Potential golden cross setup |
| atr | 2.5 | Moderate volatility, adjust position sizes |
| bollinger middle | Close price | Serving as a dynamic benchmark |

**Risk Management**

* Set stop-loss levels below the recent low (215.18)
* Adjust position sizes based on ATR
* Use risk-reward ratio to manage potential losses

Please note that this is a cautious approach, and you should always consider your own risk tolerance and trading strategy before making any decisions.
