Based on the comprehensive analysis provided by your team of analysts, I have carefully considered the pros and cons of Square Inc. (SQ) as an investment opportunity. After weighing the arguments presented by both sides, I agree with the sell stance proposed in the plan.

The concerns raised about regulatory uncertainty, competition from established players, and high cash burn rates are valid and significant enough to warrant caution. While SQ's strong branding and customer loyalty are impressive, they may not be sufficient to overcome the risks associated with investing in the company.

Furthermore, the valuation expectations for SQ seem reasonable given its high P/E ratio and growth prospects. The expected decline to 35 by 2025 is still relatively steep compared to industry averages, indicating a need for caution.

In light of these concerns, I recommend selling Square Inc. (SQ) due to its high valuation and significant risks associated with investing in the company. This decision aligns with the investment plan's recommendation to sell SQ, diversify the portfolio, monitor regulatory developments, and adjust valuation expectations.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
