**Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock News**

According to Finnhub, there have been several notable events affecting Apple's stock in the past week. On November 15, 2025, Apple announced its quarterly earnings results, reporting a revenue increase of 8.9% year-over-year to $90.1 billion. The company also reported a net income of $22.3 billion, up from $20.4 billion in the same quarter last year.

In a statement, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue delivering strong results despite economic headwinds. "We're seeing increased demand for our products and services, particularly in emerging markets," he said. "We're well-positioned to take advantage of these trends and drive long-term growth."

However, not all news about Apple has been positive. On November 20, 2025, a report by Bloomberg suggested that Apple is facing significant challenges in its Chinese market. The report stated that the company's iPhone sales have declined sharply in recent months due to increased competition from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi.

**Reddit News**

On Reddit, there has been ongoing discussion about the impact of inflation on Apple's stock price. Some users have argued that the company's dependence on a strong US dollar makes it vulnerable to economic downturns, while others have pointed out that Apple's diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty provide a degree of insulation against economic shocks.

**Google News**

According to Google News, there have been several articles published in the past week discussing the potential impact of a global economic slowdown on Apple's stock price. A report by CNBC suggested that investors are becoming increasingly concerned about the prospects for Apple's iPhone sales in 2026, citing declining demand in China and increased competition from other smartphone manufacturers.

Another article by The Wall Street Journal noted that Apple's cash reserves have been depleted in recent years due to increased investment in research and development and strategic acquisitions. This has led some analysts to question whether the company can maintain its dividend payments in the face of a potential economic downturn.
