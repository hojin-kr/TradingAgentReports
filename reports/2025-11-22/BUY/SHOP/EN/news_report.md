**Report**

Over the past week, there have been several significant developments in the markets and economy. According to Finnhub, the stock price of SHOP, a Canadian retail company, has been on a downward trend since November 15th. The stock closed at $20.50 on November 19th, down from $23.25 on November 10th. This decline is largely attributed to increased competition in the retail sector and concerns over the company's ability to maintain profitability.

In contrast, the US economy has been showing signs of strength. According to Google News, there have been several articles highlighting the growth of the US economy, including a report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis that showed a 2.5% increase in GDP in the third quarter of 2023. This growth is largely driven by consumer spending and business investment.

However, there are also concerns about inflation and interest rates. According to Reddit News, there have been several discussions on WallStreetBets about the impact of rising interest rates on the stock market. Some traders believe that higher interest rates will lead to a decrease in stock prices, while others argue that it will lead to a stronger US dollar.
