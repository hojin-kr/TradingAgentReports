Thanks for the prompt. I tried to pull Reddit-based stock news for PLTR on 2025-10-15, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError and isn’t giving me Reddit sentiment data right now. I can either retry the data pull immediately, or proceed with a comprehensive analysis using other sources (news, general social sentiment outside Reddit, press releases, and public filings) and clearly mark where Reddit data would be incorporated once the tool is available. Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here is a structured framework and an interim analysis approach you can use.

What I can provide now (framework-focused, without Reddit-specific data)
- Objective: Deliver a detailed, trader-oriented read on Palantir Technologies (PLTR) by integrating sentiment concepts from social chatter (where available), recent company news, and market-influencing catalysts, then translate into actionable implications for traders.

1) Sentiment framework (without Reddit data)
- Overall tone: Track positive vs. negative chatter across primary channels (X/Twitter, StockTwits, LinkedIn comments, forums) and compute a daily sentiment index. Without Reddit, we’ll still capture a high-fidelity pulse from other platforms.
- Key metrics to monitor daily:
  - Volume of mentions (count of posts referencing PLTR)
  - Net sentiment (positive minus negative mentions)
  - Peak sentiment days (identify days with outsized positive/negative swings)
  - Thematic clusters (AI product updates, government contracts, earnings commentary, data privacy/regulatory concerns, competition)
- 7-day/14-day trends: Look for momentum shifts (e.g., a rising sentiment line after a product update or a downtick after regulatory chatter).

2) News and event-driven drivers (recent weeks)
- Product and platform updates: Any material releases or enhancements to Palantir’s AI capabilities, data integration, or scalability that could influence enterprise adoption.
- Government and enterprise demand: Any notable contract wins, expansions in existing accounts (federal, state, or commercial), or commentary on contract slowdowns or procurement cycles.
- Financial and guidance signals: Quarterly earnings cadence, revenue mix shifts (government vs. commercial), margins, and cadence of customer additions.
- Regulatory/compliance context: Any antitrust, data privacy, or export controls discussions that could alter growth trajectory.
- Competitive landscape: Activity from peers in the AI/data analytics space affecting PLTR's positioning (e.g., partnerships, interoperability, pricing dynamics).

3) Price action and setup (what to watch)
- Short-term catalysts: AI product news, government contract announcements, enterprise deployments, or earnings surprises.
- Technical read: Look for key support/resistance levels, moving averages (e.g., 20/50/200-day, depending on the time horizon), and RSI/volume divergences around catalysts.
- Implied volatility: If there are near-term catalysts (earnings or major product announcements), monitor options activity for skew or unusual volume that may reflect hedging vs. speculation.

4) Risk factors to consider
- Revenue concentration risk: Dependence on government contracts vs. commercial enterprise momentum.
- Procurement cycles: Government spending and contract-award cycles can create uneven revenue timing.
- AI risk and data governance: Regulatory scrutiny or data-privacy concerns affecting deployment or customer sentiment.
- Competition and pricing pressure: Developments from other AI/data analytics platforms affecting PLTR’s value proposition.

5) How to structure the final assessment (deliverable you’ll see)
- Executive snapshot: Core sentiment signals, recent news highlights, and immediate catalysts.
- Thematic sentiment breakdown: AI/product updates, government/enterprise demand, regulatory signals, competitive dynamics.
- Catalyst calendar: Upcoming events and the potential market impact.
- Trading implications: Short-term (days to weeks) and intermediate-term (weeks to months) implications, with scenario-based guidance (bullish, neutral, bearish).
- Risks and caveats: Data gaps, potential biases in sentiment signals, and limitations of the sources used.

What I can do next (two options)
- Option 1: Retry the Reddit data pull now and deliver a full, sentiment-rich PLTR report including Reddit-specific daily sentiment, themes, and a final table.
- Option 2: Proceed immediately with a high-fidelity, Reddit-free report using all available non-Reddit sources, plus a robust methodology for incorporating Reddit data as soon as the tool works again, and include a plan for updating with Reddit data in a follow-up.

If you want me to proceed now with Option 2 (no Reddit data for the moment), I’ll deliver:
- An in-depth narrative on PLTR’s current sentiment landscape based on recent news, press releases, and non-Reddit social signals.
- A day-by-day sentiment outline for the past week using non-Reddit sources, with caveats about data gaps due to the tool issue.
- A precise list of upcoming catalysts and the associated potential market impact.
- A final Markdown table organizing key takeaways (sources, sentiment direction, catalysts, and trading implications).

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull now (Option 1) or proceed with Option 2? If you prefer, I can also attempt both: retry Reddit data first, and while we wait, deliver the Option 2 framework so you have something actionable immediately.
