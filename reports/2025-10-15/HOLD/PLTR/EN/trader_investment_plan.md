Decision: Hold Palantir (PLTR) today.

Why Hold (consistent with the plan)
- Valuation vs near-term fundamentals: The current price action implies optimistic assumptions about ARR growth, gross margin lift, and AI-driven demand. Until we see durable, non-government growth and meaningful margin progression, the risk of multiple compression remains a key headwind.
- Non-government execution uncertainty: The bull case hinges on commercial/healthcare cross-sell velocity and higher-value deployments. If these stay tepid or lumpy, downside risk from valuation could re-emerge even if government performance holds.
- Structural moat remains intact but needs proof points: Foundry’s governance and data capabilities are meaningful, but real-world revenue mix and cross-sell realization must be demonstrated with durable ARR/ACV gains.

What would upgrade to Buy look like (clear triggers)
- Sustained non-government ARR/ACV growth: multiple quarters of meaningful expansion in commercial and healthcare segments, with improving net-new logos and higher cross-sell velocity.
- Margin visibility: credible path to gross margin expansion and operating leverage, supported by higher mix, price progression, or cost discipline.
- Consistent non-government revenue growth: steady, less-lumpy contributions from commercial/healthcare, with improving contract durations, renewals, and visibility.
- Technical confirmation: solid price action confirmations (e.g., price above 50-SMA with favorable SMA alignment, MACD bullish confirmation, RSI holding above midline) alongside improving breadth/volume.

Risk controls and plan around catalysts
- Maintain liquidity and risk discipline: keep position size modest if you don’t already own PLTR; for existing holders, use ATR-based stops and defined hedges around earnings.
- Catalyst awareness: pay close attention to earnings (Q3 2025) and management commentary on ARR/ACV mix, as well as any notable contract wins or cross-sell milestones.
- Diversification: avoid overweight exposure to a single name; balance with other AI-enabled software exposure to reduce idiosyncratic risk.

Monitoring framework (8-indicator style)
- Track ARR/ACV progression in commercial/healthcare, gross margin trajectory, non-government revenue growth, contract renewals, and cross-sell momentum.
- Integrate price/volume signals (trend, momentum, volatility) to confirm a breakout or to warn of risk regimes.

Operational actions if you’re already long
- If you already hold PLTR, consider trimming to maintain a 1–2% position cap in new money, and use defined risk levels to preserve capital while awaiting clearer evidence.
- If you’re starting anew, avoid a large initation now; a very small starter could be considered only on a confirmed technical breakout with controlled risk.

If you want, I can run a data-driven 8-indicator readout to quantify a bear-forward vs. bull-forward setup for PLTR and tailor a follow-up action plan based on live signals.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
