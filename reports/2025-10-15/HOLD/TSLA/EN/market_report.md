Thanks for the queue. I attempted to fetch TSLA data and run the indicator suite, but the data service returned errors (FileNotFoundError) for both the price data feed and the indicator reports. I can proceed with a solid, strategy-focused indicator setup that would work well once data access is restored. Below is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators, with rationale tailored to TSLA’s typical volatility and market behavior.

Selected indicators (8)

- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Why these are suitable for TSLA now

- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - What it reveals: the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why TSLA: TSLA often pendulates around its mid-term trend; using 50SMA helps detect regime shifts (sustained above/below signals ongoing trend strength).

- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - What it reveals: the long-term trend; major macro-bias reference (golden/death cross contexts when combined with other signals).
  - Why TSLA: TSLA’s longer-term cycles can be driven by fundamental catalysts; 200SMA helps confirm whether you’re in a broader uptrend or drawdown phase.

- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  - What it reveals: short-term momentum and quick shifts in price pressure.
  - Why TSLA: In fast-moving name like TSLA, the 10-EMA can flag timely entry/exit points and short-term trend reversals that other slower averages might miss.

- macd (MACD line)
  - What it reveals: momentum via differences of EMAs; crossovers indicate potential trend changes.
  - Why TSLA: Supports discerning shift strength when price is oscillating around key levels; helps filter false signals in volatile periods when used with other tools.

- macds (MACD Signal line)
  - What it reveals: momentum confirmation via the MACD signal line.
  - Why TSLA: The MACD cross with the MACD Signal strengthens (or weakens) the momentum signal, adding a cross-confirmation layer to the MACD reading.

- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - What it reveals: momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why TSLA: In high-volatility regimes, RSI can overextend. Use with trend context (price relative to SMAs) to spot possible reversals or divergences.

- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it reveals: current volatility magnitude; helps manage risk (stop placement, position sizing).
  - Why TSLA: TSLA tends to exhibit spikes in volatility around catalysts. ATR helps calibrate risk and adapt stops/position sizes to volatility regime.

- vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
  - What it reveals: trend confirmation when price moves are supported by volume.
  - Why TSLA: Volume dynamics are critical for a name with big moves. VWMA helps validate price-driven moves with market participation, aiding in filtering false breakouts.

How to read signals in combination (practical framework)

- Trend confirmation
  - Price above 50SMA and above 200SMA generally indicates bullish bias; look for 10-EMA cross above price or above 50SMA for momentum confirmation.
  - If price is below both SMAs, be cautious of long entries; look for potential pullback reversals where price tests 50SMA or 200SMA as support.

- Momentum confirmation
  - MACD crossing above its signal (macd crosses macds) supports a bullish move; MACD histogram turning positive (macdh rising) reinforces upward momentum.
  - RSI above 50 helps corroborate upside momentum; RSI nearing overbought (above 70) warrants caution and tighter risk control unless supported by strong trend.

- Volatility and risk management
  - Rising ATR signals expanding volatility; consider wider stops or smaller position sizes to manage risk.
  - If ATR contracts while price moves, that may imply a consolidation phase; use VWMA in that window to judge if volume is drying up or still supporting the move.

- Volume-backed validation
  - Price advances with rising VWMA give more conviction; price moves on light volume with VWMA not supporting the move suggest potential reversals or traps.

Notes and caveats

- Data availability: I could not fetch TSLA data or indicator outputs due to a data-access error. Once the data service is restored, the above indicators can be computed and monitored in real-time to generate actionable signals.
- Redundancy risk: This set avoids overloading with multiple MACD components beyond macd and macds to keep signals clear while still providing momentum nuance via histogram considerations. If you prefer, macds can be replaced by a cross-check with RSI or VWMA; the current mix preserves trend, momentum, volatility, and volume perspectives.
- Market context awareness: TSLA is sensitive to fundamentals (production, demand, policy) and tech-sector shifts. Use the indicators as a framework, not as a sole signal source; combine with macro factors and event calendars.

Appendix: quick-reference table (key points)

| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret (bullish/bearish) | Practical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above = bullish bias; below = bearish bias | Trend direction, dynamic support |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend reference | Price above = long-term uptrend; below = downtrend | Strategic trend confirmation |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | 10-EMA above price or turning upward = bullish momentum | Timely entry/exit signals, momentum shifts |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD line crossing above zero and above MACD signal = bullish; below = bearish | Momentum trend change signals |
| macds | MACD signal line | MACD crossing MACDS = confirmation of MACD trend shift | Filter for MACD entries/exits |
| rsi | Momentum strength, overbought/oversold | RSI rising toward overbought (>70) or falling toward oversold (<30) | Reversal risk, divergence checks |
| atr | Market volatility | Rising ATR = higher volatility; falling ATR = compression | Position sizing, stop placement, risk management |
| vwma | Volume-weighted trend confirmation | Price movement supported by rising VWMA = stronger move; divergence with VWMA warns | Validate moves with volume; filter false breakouts |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data and compute these indicators as soon as the data service is back, then provide a data-grounded, point-by-point read of current TSLA conditions.
