Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit+stock info for TSLA, but the tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I can either retry that data pull now, or proceed using the available methods (e.g., other public signals, news, and sentiment proxies) and clearly flag any data gaps.

What I can do next (please choose):
- Retry now: I’ll re-run the Reddit stock-info fetch for TSLA for 2025-10-15 and then build the full report with direct sentiment and news data.
- Proceed without the Reddit tool: I’ll produce a comprehensive long-form TSLA social sentiment and news analysis using non-tool sources and provide a structured report with placeholders where Reddit data would go, plus a detailed actionable framework for traders.

If you’d like me to proceed immediately, I’ll draft a complete long report focusing on social media sentiment (to the extent possible without the Reddit data), recent company news, and implications for traders, ending with a Markdown table organizing key points.

Proposed structure of the final long report (regardless of whether we have Reddit data yet)
- Executive snapshot
  - Brief situational overview for TSLA on 2025-10-15
  - What traders should watch in the next 1–2 weeks
- Sentiment overview (by source)

Please tell me which path you prefer:
1) Retry the Reddit stock-info fetch for TSLA now and then generate the full report with the actual Reddit data included, or
2) Proceed with the full report now using non-Reddit sources and clearly labeled data gaps where Reddit data would normally appear.

If you want me to retry, I’ll kick off the Reddit fetch immediately and then craft the complete report with the data as soon as it’s retrieved.
