I attempted to fetch data and run the indicator analyses for GOOGL, but the data retrieval step failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the tool environment. I can’t compute the current indicator values without the price data. If you’d like, I can retry the data pull, try an alternate date range, or proceed with a framework you can apply once data is available. In the meantime, here is a careful plan with the most relevant indicators you can use for GOOGL, along with the rationale and how to interpret signals in this stock’s context.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)

1) close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
- What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- How to interpret: Price above the 50 SMA suggests a bullish mid-term trend; price crossing above/below 50 SMA can signal a trend continuation or pullback. Use with a shorter-term mover to filter noise (e.g., the 10 EMA).
- Why it’s suitable for GOOGL: Alphabet tends to exhibit clear mid-term trend characteristics around earnings cycles; 50 SMA helps confirm trend direction beyond daily noise.

2) close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
- What it measures: Long-term trend baseline.
- How to interpret: Price above the 200 SMA indicates a long-term uptrend; a cross of price or faster averages below/above can signal major regime shifts (golden/death cross patterns are more strategic than tactical here).
- Why it’s suitable: Gives a high-level contextual anchor for strategic decisions and risk management.

3) close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
- What it measures: Short-term momentum; responsive to recent price moves.
- How to interpret: A bullish signal when the 10 EMA crosses above longer-term averages (e.g., 50 SMA) or when price rises above the 10 EMA. Watch for crossovers that align with the 50/200 SMA trend for higher-probability entries.
- Why it’s suitable: Captures timely shifts in momentum that may precede price moves, useful in fast-moving tech names around earnings or product announcements.

4) macd (MACD)
- What it measures: Momentum via EMA differences.
- How to interpret: MACD line crossing above the signal line suggests bullish momentum; crossing below suggests bearish momentum. Positive MACD values reinforce uptrends; negative values reinforce downtrends.
- Why it’s suitable: Works well with price trends in large-cap growth names like GOOGL, helping identify momentum shifts that aren’t yet price-confirmed.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- What it measures: Smoothing of MACD line; signals timing of momentum changes.
- How to interpret: MACD crossing the MACD Signal line is a timing cue for entries/exits. Confluence with price trend increases signal reliability.
- Why it’s suitable: Reduces false signals from MACD in choppy markets and helps align entry/exit with momentum shifts.

6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
- What it measures: Momentum strength and divergence (the gap between MACD and its signal).
- How to interpret: Expanding histogram suggests strengthening momentum in the direction of the MACD; shrinking or negative histogram indicates weakening momentum. Divergence between price and histogram can precede reversals.
- Why it’s suitable: Provides a visual, early cue on momentum changes that can precede price moves, useful near key levels or around earnings.

7) rsi (RSI)
- What it measures: Short- to mid-term momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
- How to interpret: RSI above ~70 indicates overbought conditions; below ~30 indicates oversold. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; use RSI signals in conjunction with trend indicators (50/200 SMA, MACD).
- Why it’s suitable: Helps identify potential reversals and overextensions when used with trend context, especially around major news events or stock-wide momentum shifts.

8) atr (ATR)
- What it measures: Market volatility (average true range).
- How to interpret: Rising ATR implies increasing volatility (adjust position sizing and stop levels accordingly); falling ATR suggests compression and potential breakout setups when combined with price action near support/resistance.
- Why it’s suitable: Critical for risk management in a high-valuation, event-driven stock like GOOGL; helps set practical stop losses and adapt position sizes to current volatility.

Notes on interpretation when data is available
- Context matters: In tech mega-caps, a confluence of signals is more reliable. For example, price above 50/200 SMA with MACD positive and MACD Histogram expanding supports a stronger setup than any single signal alone.
- Divergences: Watch for RSI or MACD divergences against price, which can precede reversals even if trend indicators look persistent.
- Earnings and catalysts: Be mindful of timing around quarterly earnings, product launches, or regulatory news, as these can trigger rapid momentum shifts that the MACD/MFI/rsi framework should help catch but require quick risk management via ATR-informed stops.

Next steps
- If you want, I can retry fetching data for GOOGL now (or with a different date range, e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31). Alternatively, you can provide a CSV of historical OHLC data and I’ll compute the indicators locally.
- If you’re comfortable, I can also proceed with a qualitative pass using typical patterns for GOOGL based on historical behavior, but the precise current signals would be more reliable with fresh data.

Key points table

| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret signals | Why it’s useful for GOOGL |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50 SMA = bullish mid-term; cross signals with 10 EMA for entries | Helps confirm trend direction in a large-cap tech stock with periodic volatility |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend baseline | Price above 200 SMA = long-term uptrend; watch for crossovers with faster averages | Provides strategic backdrop for positions and risk tiering |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Beige signals when 10 EMA crosses above/below longer averages; indicates quick shifts | Captures timely momentum moves around catalysts |
| macd | MACD | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD line crossing signal line; positive/negative momentum | Signals momentum regime shifts aligned with price trends |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD for timing | MACD vs MACD Signal cross as entry/exit timing cue | Reduces false momentum signals, improves timing |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength/divergence | Expanding histogram = strengthening momentum; divergences warn of reversals | Early visual cue on momentum changes |
| rsi | RSI | Momentum/overbought-oversold | >70 overbought, <30 oversold; use with trend context | Helps identify potential reversals or continued strength in uptrends |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility | Rising ATR = higher volatility (adjust stops); falling ATR = quieter markets | Essential for risk management and position sizing around events |
