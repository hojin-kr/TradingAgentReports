I tried to fetch the latest Reddit-based stock news for GOOGL (GOOGL) using the provided tool, but I’m hitting an internal error (FileNotFoundError). It looks like the Reddit data source isn’t accessible at the moment, so I can’t pull the day-by-day sentiment data you asked for right now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry the Reddit data pull: I can attempt the tool call again if you’d like.
- Use alternative data sources: I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis based on other public signals (major news headlines, earnings, product launches, regulatory updates, and general social sentiment from other platforms) and clearly label the sources as “not Reddit.” If you have other sources you want included, tell me.
- Wait and collect once the Reddit tool is available: I can pause and resume once the tool returns.

What would you prefer?
- Retry Reddit data now
- Proceed with an alternative data sources approach (and I’ll deliver a comprehensive long report with sentiment signals, news highlights, risk/implication insights, and a concluding table)
- Wait and try again later

If you want me to continue now with alternatives, I’ll produce:
- A detailed sentiment analysis narrative (daily sentiment trends over the past 7 days, with notable posts/topics)
- Key news highlights about Alphabet/GOOGL (regulatory, AI initiatives, earnings, partnerships)
- Implications for traders (short-term catalysts, narrative shifts, risk factors)
- A Markdown table at the end organizing the key takeaways

Please confirm which path you prefer.
