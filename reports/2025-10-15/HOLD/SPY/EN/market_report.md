Thanks for the ticker, SPY. I attempted to fetch the data needed to generate the indicators, but I’m running into a backend data retrieval error.

What happened
- I tried to call get_YFin_data for SPY with a date range from 2024-10-15 to 2025-10-15.
- Both attempts returned: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like a data source issue on my end rather than a strategy issue.
- I can retry automatically after a short pause, or proceed with a qualitative, rules-based framework now that you have the plan for SPY.

What I can do next
- If you’d like, I can retry to fetch SPY data now and then compute the 8 indicators below as soon as the data import succeeds.
- If you prefer immediate value, I can provide a detailed, SPY-specific interpretation framework using the selected indicators (without the actual numeric outputs yet). Then, once data is available, I’ll fill in the precise trend readings and signals.

Proposed 8 indicators for SPY (diverse, complementary, no redundancy)
Rationale: SPY is a broad-market ETF; using a mix of trend, momentum, volatility, and volatility-adjusted levels gives a robust view without overfitting to one signal type.

- close_50_sma
  - What it tells you: medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. 
  - Why SPY: Helps confirm the broader market trend and filter entries in pullbacks/rallies.

- close_200_sma
  - What it tells you: long-term trend benchmark; major support/resistance level; golden/death cross signals.
  - Why SPY: Useful for macro-context (bull vs bear regime) and position-sizing anchors.

- close_10_ema
  - What it tells you: responsive short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action.
  - Why SPY: Provides timely entry/exit cues in fast-moving market days or after macro news.

- macd
  - What it tells you: momentum changes via MACD line vs. signal line crossovers and histogram.
  - Why SPY: Helps identify regime changes and divergence with price during swings.

- macds
  - What it tells you: MACD signal line; crossovers with macd provide timing for trades.
  - Why SPY: Filters MACD crossovers for more robust entry/exit signals.

- rsi
  - What it tells you: momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why SPY: Useful for spotting reversals, especially when used with trend filters from SMAs.

- boll
  - What it tells you: middle Bollinger SMA provides a dynamic price benchmark; bands show volatility regimes.
  - Why SPY: Helps gauge squeeze/breakout contexts and mean-reversion potential around the mid-line.

- atr
  - What it tells you: market volatility and risk level; helps size positions and place stops.
  - Why SPY: Useful for adapting risk management to changing volatility regimes, especially around macro events.

How I’ll interpret signals (once data is available)
- Trend alignment: Prefer trades when price is above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA for bullish bias, and below them for bearish bias. Confirm with close_10_ema direction.
- Momentum confirmation: Look for MACD crossovers (macd crossing above macds for bullish momentum; vice versa for bearish) in the context of RSI not producing extreme overbought/oversold readings unless supported by trend.
- Volatility context: Use ATR to adjust stop placement and position sizing; higher ATR means wider stops and/or smaller size to manage risk.
- Breakouts vs mean reversion: Boll indicators help identify whether prices are testing the upper/lower bands versus reverting to the middle; combine with MACD and RSI to differentiate breakouts from false moves.
- Risk management discipline: Use ATR-based stops, consider laddered exits around major levels (e.g., around the 50/200 SMAs, or near Bollinger bands) to manage drawdowns.

Next steps
- I will reattempt the data fetch for SPY as soon as the data source is available, and then I’ll generate a detailed, SPY-specific, multi-indicator report with:
  - A trends and signals narrative (near-term to multi-week horizon)
  - Specific readings for each indicator
  - Trade setup ideas (entry, stop, target) if applicable
  - A concise summary of risk and scenario analysis

In the meantime, here is a compact reference table of the chosen indicators and their roles for SPY:

| Indicator       | Role / What to watch for SPY                                      | Why it’s useful for SPY                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma    | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance              | Aligns with the broader market trend; filters entries     |
| close_200_sma   | Long-term trend benchmark; golden/death cross context               | Macro regime indicator; strategic trend confirmation        |
| close_10_ema    | Short-term momentum shifts; timely entry points                     | Captures quick moves; complements longer averages        |
| macd            | Momentum changes via MACD line vs. signal; histogram cues          | Signals regime changes and divergences                     |
| macds           | MACD signal line crossovers                                         | Adds timing filter to MACD-based signals                   |
| rsi             | Momentum read with overbought/oversold cues                          | Divergence and reversal hints when used with trend          |
| boll            | Bollinger middle line as a price benchmark; volatility context       | Identifies mean-reversion vs breakout contexts              |
| atr             | Volatility and risk management gauge; stop-placement efficiency     | Adapts sizing and stops to current market volatility       |

If you’d like, I can attempt another data fetch now and proceed with the full indicator analysis as soon as it succeeds. Alternatively, tell me if you prefer I switch to a purely qualitative SPY framework right away (with ready-to-use levels and scenarios) while we troubleshoot data access.
