I tried to fetch AAPL data with get_YFin_data (2024-10-15 to 2025-10-15), but the backend returned a FileNotFoundError. I’ve retried a couple of times, and it’s still not accessible on my end. I can proceed in two ways:
- Wait and retry the data pull now that the backend may recover, or
- Proceed with a well-rounded indicator plan so we’re ready to run the calculations as soon as data is available.

Here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for AAPL without much redundancy. These cover trend, momentum, volatility, and momentum-confirmation signals, and they pair well for stock-like equities with both growth/development and news-driven movement.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these are suitable for AAPL
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Establish the medium- and long-term trend backdrop to identify the prevailing direction and potential support/resistance levels. Useful for filtering trades in the context of AAPL’s strong earnings cadence and macro sensitivity.
- close_10_ema: Captures short-term momentum shifts, useful for timing entries around earnings events or catalysts that can move stock price quickly.
- macd, macds, macdh: A cohesive momentum suite. MACD provides signal-line crossovers for trend changes, MACD Signal smooths the MACD for fewer false signals, and the MACD Histogram helps gauge momentum strength and potential divergences.
- rsi: Measures relative momentum and helps flag overbought/oversold extremes, while observing for divergences with price action to anticipate reversals or continuations in a strong trend.
- atr: Adds a volatility-aware layer for risk management and position sizing, particularly around earnings and high-volatility sessions that AAPL often experiences.

How to interpret and act once data is available
- Confirm trend direction with the 50/200 SMA crossovers and the 10 EMA in the same direction to avoid whipsaw in choppy markets.
- Use MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram to validate momentum shifts before entries, especially around earnings days.
- Cross-check RSI with trend context: in a strong uptrend, RSI can stay overbought for longer; look for bullish/rullish divergence as early warning rather than sole signals.
- Apply ATR to set dynamic stop-loss levels and to scale position sizes according to current volatility, reducing risk during high-volatility earnings periods.
- Combine these signals to form a rule set (e.g., bullish entry when price is above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD bullish, RSI above 50 but not in extreme overbought, and ATR indicates elevated but tradable volatility).

Proposed report format to fill once data is available
- A detailed narrative of the current trend (based on SMA crosses and price position relative to them).
- Momentum assessment (MACD/MACD histograms and RSI status/divergences).
- Volatility and risk (ATR-driven stop levels and position sizing guidance).
- A compact decision table (entry/exit/hold) based on the above.

Markdown table: Key indicators overview
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | Why it’s relevant for AAPL now | How to interpret for trades |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | 50-day trend and dynamic support/resistance | Provides mid-term trend context, useful for filtering trades around catalysts | Price above 50SMA with rising slope supports long entries; price below suggests caution or shorts in a downtrend |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | 200-day long-term trend | Confirms longer-term direction; helps avoid counter-trend trades | Price above 200SMA indicates bullish bias; cross below could indicate a secular shift or consolidation |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum/shift in price | Detects quick shifts around events (earnings, product launches) | Price above 10EMA with positive slope supports entry; cross below can be a caution signal in choppy markets |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMAs; trend strength | Core momentum signal; robust when used with other filters | Bullish MACD crossover with price above key MAs strengthens long entries; bearish crossover supports exits |
| macds | MACD Signal | EMA-smoothed MACD line | Smoother confirmation to avoid false MACD signals | MACD crosses above MACD Signal add confidence to entries; crosses below suggest exits or shorts |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Gap between MACD line and its signal | Visual momentum strength; divergences can precede price moves | Growing histogram supports momentum in the current direction; shrinking/negative histogram warns of reversal risk |
| rsi | Momentum Indicator | Relative momentum, overbought/oversold | Helps time entries around price extremes and identify divergences | RSI rising into overbought requires confirmation from trend; RSI near oversold with bullish divergence is a potential reversal cue |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility (range, price movement) | Essential for risk management and sizing, especially around earnings | Higher ATR suggests wider stops; lower ATR allows tighter stops and potentially tighter risk controls |

Next steps
- I’ll retry the data pull as soon as the backend is available again. If you’d like, I can also switch to a narrower date window (e.g., last 6–9 months) or a different ticker to validate the workflow.
- If you have a preferred date range, earnings cycle focus, or specific strategy (swing vs. intraday), tell me and I’ll tailor the indicator interpretation and risk guidelines accordingly.

Would you like me to keep retrying the data fetch now and proceed with the eight indicators as soon as data is retrieved? Or would you prefer a different ticker/date window to test the setup in the meantime?
