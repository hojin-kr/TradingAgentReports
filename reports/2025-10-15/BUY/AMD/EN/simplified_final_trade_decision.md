# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD aims to ride a multi-quarter AI compute cycle, supported by Oracle and OpenAI demand and an open ROCm/Helios platform that could boost software leverage and hardware use. The longer-term view is attractive, but near-term risks exist.
## Investment Decision
Buy, with high confidence.
## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Durable AI demand from multiple customers: Oracle has commitments to deploy 50,000 MI450 GPUs in OCI starting 2026, with OpenAI as a major AMD customer over a multi-year period.
- Open ROCm/Helios platform as a differentiator: An open software-hardware ecosystem could lift margins and hardware utilization beyond a pure GPU cycle.
- Diversified AI platform: AMD’s CPU-and-GPU integration and broader AI workloads offer a path beyond a single GPU cycle.
- Clear events that could move the stock: Oracle milestones, ongoing OpenAI relationships, ROCm ecosystem progress, and Helios adoption provide visible upside.
- Optionality with disciplined risk control: The pluses come with risks, but a platform approach adds optionality beyond marquee deals.

## Risks To Watch
- Nvidia’s broader moat and macro softness could slow cloud spending and AI demand.
- ROCm ecosystem maturity risk: adoption could be slower and onboarding may face friction.
- Execution risk on ramping Oracle/OpenAI deals and other AI demand signals.
- Regulatory and supply-chain concerns that could affect timing or costs.
- Valuation risk if milestones slide or market conditions worsen, leading to larger price swings.
