Executive summary
- Verdict: Buy (with disciplined entry, risk controls, and catalyst awareness)
- Core thesis: AMD stands to benefit from a multi-quarter AI compute cycle (Oracle’s MI450 deployments, OpenAI engagements) and an open platform strategy (ROCm/Helios) that can foster software-to-hardware leverage and diversified AI workloads beyond pure GPU cycles. Risks include Nvidia’s moat, ROCm ecosystem maturation, and macro softness; these are balanced by a broader platform thesis and potential margin expansion if software tooling accelerates.

Trade-ready framework (plug in live data)
1) Entry criteria (confluence to open a position)
- Price action: Price above both 50-day and 200-day SMAs (trend confirmation).
- Momentum: MACD positive with MACD line above signal and histogram rising; 10-day EMA crossing up or already above MACD line.
- Momentum strength: RSI rising, not yet overbought (e.g., >40 but not in the 70s).
- Volatility/momentum breakout: Price testing or breaking above the Bollinger upper band with ATR confirming momentum (rising ATR).
- If you don’t have full confluence, initiate a staged entry once 2 of the 3 momentum signals are in place and risk only a small initial tranche.

2) Position sizing and portfolio context
- Initial exposure: 1-2% of portfolio for the first tranche.
- If signals remain intact after momentum confirmation, scale up toward 3-4% total exposure.
- Be cautious around catalysts (earnings, Oracle/OpenAI updates); pare back or pause if volatility spikes meaningfully.

3) Entry price and stop levels
- Entry trigger: Close above the confluence for 2–3 consecutive sessions, or a clean breakout above the Bollinger upper band with rising ATR.
- Initial stop: ATR-based stop 1.0x to 1.5x ATR below entry (adjust to your risk tolerance and chart baseline).
- If price reverses and closes back below the 50-day SMA, tighten stops or exit.

4) Profit targets and exit plan
- Initial target: 1.5x to 2x initial risk.
- Profit management: Partial take-profit (e.g., 50% or 2/3) once hit; let the remainder ride with a tightened trailing stop.
- If momentum stays positive, keep a trailing stop to capture upside while protecting gains.
- Hard exit triggers: MACD turns negative, RSI stalls, or price closes meaningfully below major trend supports.

5) Catalysts and timing
- Monitor: Oracle’s deployment trajectory (50k MI450/OCI), OpenAI collaboration milestones, ROCm ecosystem progress, and Helios platform adoption.
- Be aware that macro cycles can influence cloud capex; adjust exposure accordingly.

6) Risk management and hedging
- Consider a protective hedge (collar or put options) around catalyst windows if you’re carrying a larger core position.
- Maintain diversification across AI beneficiaries to avoid single-name concentration risk.

7) Post-decision review
- Weekly check-in on price vs. 50/200 SMA, MACD, RSI, and Bollinger/ATR readings.
- If ROCm adoption stalls or Oracle/OpenAI momentum falters, reassess quickly and tighten risk or reduce exposure.

8) Lessons and discipline notes
- Favor breadth of demand signals over a single marquee deal; require tangible software ecosystem progression for durable revenue growth.
- Strict risk controls (ATR stops, clear entry/exit rules, catalyst-aware positioning) to avoid overstay in a choppy setup.

Caveats
- AMD faces competition from Nvidia’s dominant position and potential ROCm ecosystem maturation risks; macro softness can dampen near-term cloud capex.
- This plan emphasizes a data- and catalyst-driven approach with disciplined risk management rather than a hype-driven bet.

If you want, I can tailor this into an exact one-page briefing with live price levels, and provide concrete entry/exit prompts once you share current price, SMA values, MACD, RSI, and ATR readings.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
