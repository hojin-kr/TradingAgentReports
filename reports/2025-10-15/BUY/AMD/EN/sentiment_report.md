I hit an internal error trying to fetch Reddit stock info for AMD on 2025-10-15 (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can’t pull the Reddit feed right now.

Here are the options so we can move forward:

- Option 1: I retry the Reddit data fetch immediately and then generate the full long-form report with the latest sentiment and news once that succeeds.
- Option 2: If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a comprehensive AMD sentiment/news/earnings-context report using other sources I can access (e.g., recent press releases, company earnings notes, major news headlines, and general market sentiment proxies) and clearly label where Reddit data is missing. I’ll still aim for a thorough, trader-focused analysis and include a Markdown table at the end.
- Option 3: If you have a specific date or a different data source you want me to pull from, share it and I’ll align the report to that.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like me to proceed right away with Option 2, I’ll assemble a detailed AMD report (past week focus, sentiment drift, notable news events, and implications for traders) and include a clear methods note about data sources and any gaps.
