I attempted to fetch AMD data for 2024-10-15 to 2025-10-15 but the data retrieval tool (get_YFin_data) returned a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can retry the data fetch if you’d like, or proceed with a detailed indicator framework and trading plan now while we wait for the data to be available. Below is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators, along with why they’re suitable for AMD given a typical 衰 market/AI-cycle context, and a detailed, nuanced read of how to use them together.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- boll_ub
- atr

Rationale and how they complement each other
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it helps AMD: AMD often trades with multi-quarter cycles (product launches, data-center demand, AI/CPU/GPU shifts). The 50SMA helps you gauge the prevailing trend and filter whipsaws with faster signals.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark; signals like golden/death crosses.
  - Why it helps AMD: Distinguishes secular trend from shorter-term noise; useful for framing position sizing and risk.
- close_10_ema (10-period EMA)
  - Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum indicator.
  - Why it helps AMD: Captures quick shifts around earnings, supply-chain news, or AI demand news; complements the slower SMAs.
- macd (MACD line)
  - Purpose: Momentum indicator derived from EMAs; signals trend changes via crossovers.
  - Why it helps AMD: Works well with tech cycles where momentum can shift quickly after catalysts; use in conjunction with other filters to reduce false positives.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Purpose: Momentum strength and divergence visualization; gap between MACD line and its signal.
  - Why it helps AMD: Adds nuance on how strong the current move is and helps confirm crossovers suggested by MACD line.
- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - Purpose: Momentum indicator showing overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why it helps AMD: Useful for spotting reversals amid extended moves, especially around key events like product launches or earnings, but should be filtered with trend.
- boll_ub (Bollinger Upper Band)
  - Purpose: Upper boundary of Bollinger Bands; signals potential overbought conditions or breakout zones.
  - Why it helps AMD: Helps identify potential breakouts vs. reversals in a stock known for volatility around catalysts; should be corroborated with other indicators.
- atr (Average True Range)
  - Purpose: Volatility measure; informs position sizing and stop placement.
  - Why it helps AMD: AMD can exhibit volatile moves around earnings and AI-cycle news. ATR helps you adapt risk controls to current volatility levels.

How to read and apply (a practical framework)
- Bullish setup (summary)
  - Price above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma (trend alignment).
  - close_10_ema crossing above or staying above the MACD line; macd positive with rising macdh.
  - RSI moving higher but not in overbought extremes (e.g., not above 70 too consistently).
  - Price testing or comfortably above boll_ub with rising ATR (indicates a breakout supported by momentum and volatility).
- Bearish setup (summary)
  - Price below close_50_sma and close_200_sma; long-term trend down.
  - MACD line crossing below signal with negative macdh; RSI weakening toward or below 50.
  - Price failing near boll_ub or rolling toward the lower bands; ATR rising can imply continued volatility in the downside.
- Neutral/range-bound context (summary)
  - Price oscillating around the 50SMA with smoothed MACD and RSI hovering mid-range; ATR relatively stable.
  - In this case, prefer tighter stop management and consider range-based entries near the boll_ub or boll_lb with confirmation from MACD histogram.

Recommended trading workflow for AMD (qualitative, data-dependent)
- Confirmation filters
  - Trend filters: price above 50_sma and 200_sma for long-side entries; price below both for short-side entries.
  - Momentum filters: MACD above signal with positive macdh for bullish bias; MACD below signal with negative macdh for bearish bias.
  - Risk filter: RSI should align with trend (e.g., bullish in uptrend near mid-range) and avoid overbought extremes as the primary entry signal.
- Risk management
  - Use ATR to set initial stop-loss distance (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR) from entry to adapt to current volatility.
  - Consider dynamic position sizing based on volatility (higher ATR, smaller position; lower ATR, larger position) to manage drawdown risk.
- Entry/exit cues
  - Bullish entry when price holds above 50_sma/200_sma, MACD line rises above signal with positive macdh, RSI climbs from mid-range, and price tests/breaks above boll_ub with ATR rising.
  - Exit or reverse if MACD turns down, macdh narrows and turns negative, RSI fails to hold above mid-range, and price stalls near or below boll_ub with rising ATR signaling distribution.
- Things to watch around AMD-specific catalysts
  - Earnings or guidance updates (PC/gaming GPU demand, AI data-center growth).
  - Competitive landscape shifts (NVIDIA developments, console/discrete GPU cycles).
  - Supply chain, Foundry yields, and AI demand trends impacting margins and growth.

Note about data access
- I’m ready to re-run the data fetch (get_YFin_data) for AMD to generate a concrete, data-backed indicator readout and to populate figures for the exact date range. If you’d like me to retry, please confirm, and I’ll attempt again immediately. In the meantime, the above framework gives you a robust, complementary 8-indicator setup with a practical trading workflow for AMD.

Appendix: quick reference table
Indicator | Category | What it measures / read signals | How to apply to AMD
- close_50_sma | Moving Average (Trend) | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Use with 200_SMA to confirm trend; prefer long entries when above both
- close_200_sma | Moving Average (Trend) | Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation | Use as backdrop for risk posture; golden/death cross context
- close_10_ema | Moving Average (Momentum) | Short-term momentum shifts | Capture quick entries/exits around catalysts; filter with longer SMA
- macd | MACD | Momentum via EMA differences; crossovers signal trend changes | Look for MACD crossing above/below signal to confirm momentum shift
- macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength; divergence signals | Confirm MACD cross with histogram expansion/contract
- rsi | RSI | Momentum; overbought/oversold signals | Watch for divergences and cross back toward mid-range in uptrends
- boll_ub | Bollinger Upper Band | Potential overbought and breakout zones | Use with other signals to validate breakouts or reversals
- atr | ATR | Volatility level; stop-loss/risk sizing basis | Adjust stops and position size to current volatility

Would you like me to retry pulling the AMD data with get_YFin_data now? If you prefer, I can proceed with deeper scenario analyses or generate a chart-ready summary once the data fetch succeeds.
