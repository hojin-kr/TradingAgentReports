Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch the Reddit stock info for NFLX on 2025-10-15, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the data source or the execution environment for the tool is currently failing.

Options to move forward:
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again immediately.
- Pause and proceed with a plan: I can outline a detailed long-form analysis (sentiment, social buzz, and news) and structure the final report, and then fill in the data once the Reddit tool is functioning again.
- Use an alternative data path: If you’re open to it, I can focus on other available sources (e.g., general news headlines, earnings/attendance signals, or macro factors) and still deliver a thorough trader-focused analysis, with clear notes about data limitations until Reddit data is recovered.

What would you like me to do?
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now,
2) Proceed with an outline and methodology for the full report (so you can review the approach while the tool is fixed),
3) Or use an alternative data path (news + sentiment framework) and provide a provisional analysis in the meantime.

If you want me to retry, I’ll run the Reddit data pull for NFLX on 2025-10-15 again right away and then generate a comprehensive, fine-grained report with a Makrdown-style table at the end, as requested.
