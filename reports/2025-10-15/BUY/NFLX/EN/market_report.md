Thanks for the symbol. I attempted to fetch NFLX data for 2024-10-15 to 2025-10-15, but the data retrieval step currently failed due to an internal FileNotFoundError in the data backend. I can retry immediately, or adjust the date window (e.g., last 12 months or a shorter range) to try to pull the data again. Please tell me which option you prefer.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators (8 total) that provide diverse, complementary insights for NFLX, focusing on trend, momentum, volatility, and volume/context. Once I can fetch the data, I will generate a detailed, nuanced trend report using these indicators.

Proposed indicators and rationale for NFLX
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming ongoing trend and for pullback entries around the 50-SMA.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Represents the long-term trend baseline. Signals like golden/death crosses can inform strategic bias and major turning points.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. A responsive short-term momentum gauge to detect quick shifts and potential entry points when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd: MACD line. Measures momentum via differences in EMAs; crossovers against its own signal provide momentum-change cues to pair with trend context.
- macds: MACD Signal. EMA of MACD; its cross with MACD (or with zero line) adds a robust confirmation layer to MACD-based entries/exits.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes the gap between MACD and its signal, highlighting momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than lines cross.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index. Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; useful in confirming trend-based signals when not in extreme zones.
- atr: Average True Range. A volatility measure to help with risk management: sizing, stop placement, and understanding current volatility regimes that can affect entries and exits.

How I’ll use these together (once data is available)
- Trend confirmation: Look for price position relative to 50-SMA and 200-SMA; price above both supports a bullish bias, with potential golden cross signals (50-SMA crossing above 200-SMA) as a strong longer-term signal.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD, MACDS, and MACDH provide multi-angle momentum signals. A bullish setup would be MACD above MACDS with a rising histogram; bearish setups would show MACD below MACDS with a falling histogram.
- Entry/exit timing: Use the 10-EMA in conjunction with the longer SMAs to spot early momentum shifts; a price crossing above/below the 10-EMA after confirming the longer-term trend adds confidence for entries or partial exits.
- Overextension checks: RSI helps gauge overbought/oversold contexts to avoid chasing in extreme conditions; look for divergences against price action and corroboration from MACD.
- Volatility and risk: ATR informs position sizing and stop levels to adapt to current volatility, reducing risk during high-ATR periods and avoiding premature stops during low-ATR zones.

Next steps
- Please tell me:
  - Do you want me to retry fetching NFLX data now, or would you prefer a different date window (e.g., last 12 months, or a dedicated recent window)?
  - If you have a preferred set of indicators (up to 8), I can adjust accordingly.
