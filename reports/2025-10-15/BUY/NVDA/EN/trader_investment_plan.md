Recommendation:
- Buy NVDA with a disciplined, staged entry and robust risk controls.

Why this aligns with the plan and the current setup:
- Durable AI cycle thesis remains intact: Nvidia sits at the center of AI infrastructure adoption (hardware, software, tooling, and ecosystem), with multi-channel demand across cloud, on-prem, edge, and industrial contexts.
- End-to-end moat and monetization leverage: CUDA ecosystem and software/services create stickiness and ongoing gross-margin support beyond hardware cycles.
- Manageable downside through risk controls: a staged entry and defined hedging can participate in upside while limiting drawdowns in case of macro or policy shifts.

Structured entry plan (as outlined in the proposed plan):
- Stage 1 (starter): Enter near 190–195 if volume supports the move and confirm momentum (positive MACD, RSI not extreme, price above 50SMA/200SMA). Initial risk cap: about 1–2% of the portfolio per tranche, with a stop around 180–182 (ATR-based).
- Stage 2 (dip/ consolidation): If price drifts toward 185–188 with constructive momentum, add to the core position. Move Stage 1 stops to break-even; consider a modest trailing stop for Stage 2.
- Stage 3 (breakout/scale): If NVDA clears 198–200 on strong volume with confirmatory momentum (MACD cross, healthy RSI), increase exposure with a smaller incremental allocation.

Risk controls and hedging:
- Use ATR-based stops that adjust to volatility; widen only modestly in high-ATR regimes to avoid whipsaws, but maintain explicit risk per tranche (1–2% per tranche initially).
- Hedging options:
  - Buy protective puts or deploy a small put spread to cap downside around earnings or regulatory headlines.
  - Consider calendar/diagonal spreads to reduce cost while keeping upside optionality on near-term catalysts.
- Position sizing: Allocate roughly 4–6% of the portfolio to NVDA across all stages, excluding hedges, to manage macro risk.

Catalysts and monitoring:
- Key catalysts: DGX Spark adoption, Spectrum-X deployments, ABB collaborations, OpenAI ecosystem activity, and any regulatory/export headlines.
- Momentum checks: Monitor MACD, RSI context, volume on breaks above 198–200, and price relation to 50SMA/200SMA.
- Earnings/trends: Focus on software monetization signals (CUDA tooling usage, libraries adoption, services traction) alongside hardware sales.

What I’d apply from past learnings:
- Don’t rely on a single catalyst or headline. Confirm with multiple signals (software monetization, backlog quality, cross-channel demand).
- Avoid overexposure to one outcome; use staged entry and hedges to participate in upside while limiting downside if macro/policy shifts intensify.
- Keep the risk framework dynamic. If momentum deteriorates or price breaks below key moving averages with volume, tighten exposure quickly and reassess.

Operational notes:
- If you’d like, I can generate a live sentiment/news digest and a ready-to-fill scenario table with explicit entry/exit targets and risk flags to complement this plan.

Bottom line:
- The core thesis supports a Buy stance, implemented through a disciplined, staged entry and active risk management to participate in Nvidia’s AI-driven growth while protecting capital in uncertain moments.
