Thanks for trying. I’m seeing a tool error on the Reddit data fetch right now:

- Error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory)
- This appears to be an internal issue with the Reddit data source used by the tool.

What I can do right now
- I can retry the Reddit data fetch momentarily, but if the underlying service is unavailable, repeating the request will likely fail again.
- In the meantime, I can proceed with a robust plan for the NVDA analysis and outline a detailed report structure. Once the Reddit tool is responsive, I’ll fill in the data and finalize the long-form report with a Markdown table at the end.

Options for you
1) I retry the Reddit data pull now and proceed with filling in the report as soon as it succeeds.
2) You prefer I proceed immediately with a comprehensive outline and a template table (no data yet) and then plug in the Reddit/news sentiment data as soon as the tool works again.

Proposed plan for the NVDA social media sentiment + news analysis
- Objective: Produce a comprehensive long-form report onNVDA’s current state using social media sentiment, daily sentiment trends, and recent company news, with actionable insights for traders.
- Time window: Past 7 days leading up to 2025-10-15, plus notable longer-term catalysts within that window.
- Data sources to synthesize:
  - Social media sentiment: Reddit posts, comments, and threads; other major platforms if available (topics, virality, sentiment polarity, momentum changes).
  - News sentiment: Key headlines and articles (corporate earnings, product launches, supply chain, AI demand, regulatory factors).
  - Market context: Stock price action, volatility, options activity, any notable catalyst (guidance updates, partnerships, product announcements).
- Key analysis components:
  - Daily sentiment score trend for NVDA (up/down/flat) with volume-weighted sentiment.
  - Top topics and themes driving sentiment (e.g., AI demand, supply chain constraints, competitive landscape, guidance expectations).
  - Sentiment concentration: Are opinions clustered around a few big posts or widespread across the community?
  - News sentiment snapshot: Positive/neutral/negative framing of the week’s headlines; any notable catalysts or red flags.
  - Risk flags and opportunities: Identify potential overhangs (e.g., overoptimism, delays, regulatory risk) and catalysts that could shift sentiment (e.g., quarterly results, product/margin news).
  - Trader implications: Short-term swing trading signals, thresholds for sentiment reversals, and how sentiment aligns or diverges from price action.
- Output structure (what you’ll get):
  - Executive summary with the latest sentiment read and key takeaways.
  - Detailed section-by-section analysis (social media sentiment, daily trends, topics, and news sentiment).
  - Implications for traders, including risk factors, potential entry/exit considerations, and scenario analysis.
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing key points, sources, and implications (see template below).

Preview Markdown table structure (to be filled with data when available)
- Note: This is a template. Values marked N/A will be replaced once data is fetched.

What I need from you
- Please tell me which path you prefer:
  - Retry the Reddit data fetch now (and then generate the full report when the tool works), or
  - Proceed with the outline and template immediately, filling in data as soon as the tool becomes available.

If you’d like me to proceed with the outline now, I’ll deliver the full report framework, the risk/entry/exit implications, and a polished Markdown table skeleton right away. If you’d prefer I retry, I’ll run the Reddit data fetch again and then deliver the full long-form report with the table appended once data is in.
