I attempted to fetch NVDA data and compute the specified indicators, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry fetching the data now or later, but I don’t have the live indicator values to present yet. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of 8 indicators with rationale tailored to NVDA's typical market context (AI-sector leader, high volatility, and strong long-term uptrend in recent periods). This selection aims to provide complementary viewpoints without redundancy.

Selected indicators (up to 8), with rationale
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (medium-term trend)
  - Rationale: Helps identify the intermediate trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. In a strong uptrend, price often bounces off the 50SMA; in a pullback, it can act as a clingy re-entry zone when other signals align.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (long-term trend)
  - Rationale: Provides the overarching trend benchmark. For NVDA, staying above the 200SMA is typically a bullish condition; a cross below could signal a longer-term shift or consolidation.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages (short-term momentum)
  - Rationale: Captures quicker shifts in momentum and potential short-term entry points. Useful to see if the short end is leading the trend, especially when price tests the 50SMA or 200SMA.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: Offers momentum changes via crossovers and divergence. In NVDA’s high-volatility context, MACD crossovers can provide timely signals when used with other filters.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: MACD Histogram shows momentum strength and can reveal divergences earlier than price changes. Useful to confirm shifts signaled by macd.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Rationale: Measures momentum and overbought/oversold conditions. In a strong uptrend, RSI can remain elevated; use with trend context to avoid false reversals.
- boll_ub
  - Category: Volatility Indicators (upper band)
  - Rationale: Upper Bollinger Band signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones. In NVDA’s case, breakouts above the upper band with volume can indicate sustained momentum, but require confirmation from other signals.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Rationale: Reflects current volatility magnitude and helps with risk management (e.g., stop placement, position sizing). Elevated ATR often accompanies rapid moves in NVDA and warrants wider stops or tighter risk controls when combined with other alerts.

Notes on interpretation in NVDA’s typical context
- Trend backdrop: NVDA has historically shown strong bullish tendencies during AI-cycle booms. If price remains above the 50SMA and 200SMA, the broader trend remains favorable, and pullbacks to these levels can provide potential entries if momentum signals align.
- Momentum and overextension: A high RSI in a continuing uptrend can indicate momentum exhaustion rather than immediate reversal; look for MACD histogram shifts or bearish divergences to prune entries or plan exits.
- Volatility and risk management: Elevated ATR signals higher expected price movement; pair with ATR-based stop placement to avoid premature stops. Boll upper band expansion can precede or accompany breakouts, but require volume confirmation to avoid false breakouts.
- Signals to watch together: A bullish setup might look like price above 50SMA/200SMA, 10EMA above 50SMA, macd line above signal with rising macdh, RSI in upper-mid range without extreme overbought conditions, and price testing or breaking the boll_ub with rising ATR. A bearish scenario would show price failing to hold above the 50SMA with MACD weakening, macdh shrinking, RSI rolling over, and ATR staying elevated but price moving toward or below the 200SMA.

Trading plan ideas (high level)
- Entries: Consider entering on pullbacks to the 50SMA or Boll middle line when MACD/macdh confirm momentum, RSI remains supportive (not in hyper-overbought territory), and price shows a bounce with volume support (if you track VWMA, that would help).
- Exits: Use the upper Bollinger Band breakouts with volume as potential take-profit signals, but set stops using ATR-based levels to account for current volatility.
- Risk management: Use ATR to size positions and place stops. In high-volatility regimes, wider stops are appropriate; in choppier markets, rely more on trend filters and MACD/macd_histogram changes to avoid whipsaws.
