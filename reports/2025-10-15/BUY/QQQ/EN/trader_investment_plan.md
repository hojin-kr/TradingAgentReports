Recommendation:
- Buy QQQ with a disciplined, staged entry and explicit risk controls as a core, long-horizon tech exposure.

Key action plan (condensed from the proposed framework):
- Position sizing
  - Target core exposure: 4–8% of net investable capital (adjust to portfolio size and risk tolerance).
  - Staged entry (three tranches):
    - Tranche 1: 40–50% of target core exposure on a confirmed bullish setup.
    - Tranche 2: 25–35% more if price confirms (e.g., price above 50-day and 200-day SMAs with positive momentum).
    - Tranche 3: 15–25% on pullbacks after a durable breakout with breadth confirmation.
- Entry triggers (technical alignment)
  - Price above both 50-day and 200-day SMAs.
  - MACD bullish crossover.
  - RSI > 50 (not overbought).
  - Volume supports a breakout (above-average).
- Risk management
  - Stop: ATR-based, 1.25x–1.5x ATR below entry, scaled with position size and volatility regime.
  - Hedge options: Protective puts or a collar for partial downside protection (6–12 month horizon) to offset potential volatility.
  - Portfolio discipline: Ensure diversification beyond mega-caps to avoid concentration risk; avoid overpaying in a crowded bid.
- Monitoring cadence
  - Check weekly/monthly: trend relative to 50SMA/200SMA, MACD momentum, RSI posture, breadth indicators (broader participation among mega-caps).
  - Volatility/drawdown guardrails: Tighten stops or hedge further if ATR spikes or if price breaks key trendlines on high volume with negative news.
- Exit and contingency
  - If breadth deteriorates or macro risk spikes: reduce exposure, tighten stops, or switch to hedged/covered exposure.
  - Profit-taking: Use trailing stops and scale out if a sizable portion of gains materializes and breadth remains healthy.
  - Endgame: Break below critical trend lines or sustained breadth collapse → progressively unwind core exposure and consider hedges or shift to non-tech.
- Operational guardrails and review
  - Data hygiene: Rely on price/volume action and multi-indicator alignment rather than a single signal.
  - Documentation: Record tranche triggers, outcomes, and lessons to improve future decisions.

Rationale:
- The bull case emphasizes durable AI/cloud-driven growth, strong cash flow, and multi-name exposure within QQQ, which supports a constructive long-horizon stance when paired with disciplined risk controls and hedging.
- The plan explicitly acknowledges bear risks (breadth, macro/regulatory concerns, AI hype) and provides a structured framework to mitigate them through staged entries, diversification within mega-caps, and hedging.

Contingencies:
- If data issues arise or signals are unreliable, lean on a cautious initial tranche and prioritize establishing triggers for re-entry when data normalizes. Do not rely on hype or unverified signals.
