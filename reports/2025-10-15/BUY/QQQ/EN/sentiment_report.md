I ran the Reddit data fetch for QQQ on 2025-10-15, but the tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). It looks like a backend issue with the get_reddit_stock_info tool rather than a data problem on your end. I can retry now, or we can proceed with a plan to complete the analysis once the tool is available, or switch to alternative data sources if you’d like.

Options to proceed
- Retry now: I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again for 2025-10-15 and then proceed with the full sentiment/news analysis.
- Proceed without Reddit data for now: I’ll outline and draft the full report framework, including how I’d analyze sentiment and news, and leave placeholders for the Reddit-derived metrics to be filled once the tool works.
- Use an alternative data source (if you have one): I can incorporate non-Reddit sentiment sources you authorize, or I can rely on publicly available news sentiment frameworks.

What I can deliver right away (once data is available)
- A comprehensive long report detailing social sentiment (Reddit-focused, daily sentiment and volume) over the past week for QQQ, plus recent company/ETF-related news.
- Fine-grained insights with implications for traders and investors: momentum clues, key themes (AI/tech mega-cap focus, macro rate expectations, Nasdaq-100 dynamics), potential catalysts, and risk flags.
- A clear, easy-to-read Markdown table at the end summarizing key takeaways.

If you’d like, I can:
- Retry the Reddit data pull immediately and then return the full, filled report.
- Or, we can proceed with the report skeleton now and fill in the Reddit metrics as soon as the tool is available.

Would you prefer that I retry the Reddit fetch now, or proceed with the report framework and fill in Reddit metrics later?
