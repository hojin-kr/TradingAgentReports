Sorry—there's a hiccup with the Reddit data tool right now. The parallel tool run returned FileNotFoundError for all the dates, and a direct call to get_reddit_stock_info also failed with the same error. Likely an internal tool issue rather than something wrong with your request. I can retry in a moment, or we can proceed with alternative approaches in the meantime.

What would you like to do next?
- Option 1: Retry fetching Reddit sentiment data for PLTR (Tue Oct 17 through Tue Oct 23, 2025). I’ll run the queries again as soon as you confirm.
- Option 2: Proceed with a high-level analysis using other public signals (e.g., company news, press releases, general market sentiment) while we wait for Reddit data to come back.
- Option 3: Use a mixed approach: fetch whatever Reddit data is available now if any tool returns partial results, and supplement with other sources.

If you want me to proceed with Option 1 (retry), I’ll reattempt to pull the Reddit-focused sentiment dataset for PLTR for the week and then deliver a full, trader-focused long report. If you’d prefer Option 2 or 3, I can start outlining and analyzing what we can access right away.

In the meantime, here’s a structured plan for the long report I will deliver once we have Reddit sentiment data, plus a skeleton Markdown table you’ll see at the end of the report. This will help you understand exactly what to expect and how to use it for trading decisions.

What the long report will cover (once data is available)
- Daily sentiment breakdown
  - Positive, neutral, and negative sentiment percentages per day
  - Key drivers behind big sentiment shifts (e.g., notable posts, threads, or news events)
- Post volume and engagement
  - Daily post counts, upvotes/comments, and major contributors or subreddits (e.g., r/StockMarket, r/WallStreetBets, r/investing)
- Thematic clustering
  - AI/product updates (Foundry), governance/leadership signals, government contracting chatter, competitive landscape, valuation nerves
- News and catalysts correlation
  - Any public company news from the week (earnings hints, product launches, partnerships, contracts, regulatory updates) and how they align with sentiment
- Price and volatility context
  - Daily price moves around the sentiment shifts (e.g., did a sentiment spike precede a move into a new intraday high/low?)
  - Implied sentiment-volatility relationships (if applicable)
- Risk and trading implications
  - Short-term trading signals (intraday swing potential, mean-reversion expectations)
  - Longer-term sentiment trends and potential catalysts to watch
- Pitfalls and caveats
  - Sentiment data biases (subreddit demographics, coordinated activity, meme-driven swings)
  - Limitations of Reddit data for institutional decision-making

Proposed final deliverable format
- A comprehensive narrative analysis with data-backed observations
- A day-by-day sentiment appendix summarizing the key posts and themes
- Actionable takeaways for traders (entry/exit considerations, risk management cues)
- A Markdown table at the end to organize the core points clearly (see sample table format below)

Sample Markdown table (to be populated with actual data in the final report)
| Date | Daily Sentiment (Pos/Neu/Neg) | Top Themes/Drivers | Notable Posts/Threads | News Catalyst (if any) | Price Change % | Suggested Position (Short-term) |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 2025-10-23 | 42/38/20 | AI product chatter; contract rumors | u/ExampleUser post on Foundry update | None observed | +1.3% | Monitor for breakout; potential pullback entry if momentum fades |
| 2025-10-22 | 55/25/20 | Government contract discussion; risk-off sentiment | Large thread on governance concerns | Press release on new partnership | -0.5% | Wait for confirmation; look for support near key levels |
| 2025-10-21 | 38/40/22 | Mixed topics; volatility spikes | Several posts on valuation concerns | Earnings hint from company chatter | +2.1% | Short-term upside potential but watch for reversal risk |
| 2025-10-20 | 60/25/15 | Positive product updates; optimism around platform | Positive user experience threads | News on deployment in a new sector | +0.8% | Favor light long exposure; tighten stop losses |
| 2025-10-19 | 30/50/20 | Broad market malaise; sentiment drift | Meme-driven posts; cautionary posts | Market-wide risk-off tone | -1.2% | Reduce exposure; wait for clarity on catalysts |
| 2025-10-18 | 45/35/20 | Mixed on AI; tech sector rotation | Discussion on competition and pricing | No major catalysts | -0.3% | Sideways to mild resolve; watch for breakout/trend confirmation |
| 2025-10-17 | 50/30/20 | Balance of optimism and caution | General optimism about data analytics space | None major | +1.5% | Consider small long positioning with risk controls |

Notes
- The actual daily sentiment numbers, top themes, and price changes will be filled in once the Reddit data is retrieved.
- I will also include a brief section highlighting any notable outliers or unusually high-engagement posts that could be driving sentiment.

Would you like me to proceed with Option 1 (retry now) to fetch the Reddit data for PLTR for the week, or would you prefer I start with Option 2 or 3 and provide the best-available analysis right away?
