I attempted to fetch AMD data with the provided tool, but I’m encountering a FileNotFoundError in the Yahoo Finance data retrieval step. I can’t compute or display live indicator values until the data fetch works. Here’s a plan I can execute as soon as data access is restored, plus a carefully chosen set of indicators and a detailed AMD-focused framework you can use right away.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators, non-redundant, complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for AMD’s mid-cycle shifts (e.g., data-center demand cycles, GPU refresh timing).
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Establishes the long-term trend baseline and can confirm major trend direction (golden/death-cross contexts). Good for strategic bias on AMD.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures short-term momentum changes and potential entry points. Helpful for timelier signals in a volatile semi-conductor space.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum-based signal to spot potential trend changes via crossovers and divergence, especially in choppy or ranging phases.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoothed MACD line; crossovers with MACD help confirm trend-change signals and avoid false positives.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and divergence tendencies; useful to spot diminishing or accelerating momentum ahead of price moves.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum gauge to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; watch for divergences in strong uptrends or downtrends.
- atr: Average True Range. Measures volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing—crucial for AMD around AI/graphics demand shifts and supply-chain news.

Why these 8 are suitable for AMD in current market context
- They cover a balanced spectrum: trend (50/200 SMA), momentum (10 EMA, MACD trio, RSI), and risk management (ATR).
- The moving averages give both medium- and long-term trend context, which is useful given AMD’s exposure to cyclical demand (data center vs. consumer GPU cycles) and timing of product launches.
- MACD components provide multi-layer momentum signals, helping differentiate genuine trend moves from noise—important in a stock with frequent product-cycle-driven moves.
- RSI adds a momentum check for potential reversals after overstretched moves, which pairs well with ATR to manage risk in volatile tech equities.
- ATR adds a practical risk-management lens, crucial for AMD’s sometimes sharp intraday swings on earnings, supply chain feedback, and AI/GPU demand news.

Trading framework and fine-grained interpretation for AMD (once data is live)
- Trend confirmation checks
  - Price above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma suggests a positive macro trend for AMD; look for pullbacks toward the 50 SMA for potential entries, provided momentum signals align.
  - If price is below both SMAs, trend bias is bearish. In that case, prefer trend-following entries only on strong bullish confirmations (e.g., MACD turning up with price crossing above 50SMA).

- Momentum consensus (multi-indicator alignment)
  - Bullish setup: macd > macds and macdh turning positive, with price above 50SMA and RSI rising but not yet overbought (e.g., RSI in 40–70 range). A rising MACD histogram (macdh increasing) strengthens the case for continuation.
  - Bearish setup: macd < macds with macdh turning negative, price under SMAs, RSI failing to sustain gains (divergence with price), and ATR showing rising volatility on a downside breakout.

- Entry and exit nuances
  - Entry candidates: price retracing toward the 50SMA while MACD histogram is turning positive and RSI is climbing from oversold levels (below 50). A confirming MACD cross above the signal line adds conviction.
  - Stop placement: use ATR to size stops just beyond a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR) from the entry, adjusted for AMD’s typical volatility in the current regime.
  - Profit targets: consider a risk-reward framework (e.g., 2:1 or 3:1) using nearby resistance levels or the 50/200 SMA confluence as potential take-profit zones.

- Special considerations for AMD
  - Sector and product-cycle sensitivity: AMD often moves with AI/data-center demand, gaming GPU refresh cycles, and supply-side news. Use RSI and MACD in combination with price-position relative to SMAs to avoid getting trapped by short-lived knee-jerk moves around earnings or new product announcements.
  - Volume context: While VWMA isn’t in the selected set, you can mentally weigh volume spikes with ATR to gauge breakout legitimacy; if a breakout occurs with rising ATR and price clears 50SMA with MACD confirming momentum, it’s a stronger signal.
  - Divergence watch: In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated longer; watch for bearish RSI-divergence if price makes new highs but RSI fails to follow suit, potentially signaling a pullback.

What the above means in practice for AMD
- If AMD is in a confirmed uptrend (price above 50SMA and 200SMA) and MACD is bullish with rising MACD-H, but RSI is not overbought, a pullback toward the 50SMA could present a favorable entry with a tight ATR-based stop.
- If AMD breaks below the 200SMA with MACD turning down and RSI slipping, expect a higher likelihood of further downside; use ATR for stop sizing and consider waiting for a bullish turnaround signal before entering.
- In choppy market conditions, rely more on MACD crossovers (macd/macds) and MACD histogram changes to avoid false breakouts, while using ATR to avoid overleveraged positions.

Appendix: concise key points table (Markdown)
| Indicator | Category | Purpose | How to interpret (AMD) | Signals / Action|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Trend direction, dynamic support/resistance | Gap or pullback near 50SMA can indicate potential entries in uptrends; failure to hold may signal weakness | Enter on pullback toward 50SMA with aligning momentum signals; use 50SMA as first target/support |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above indicates bullish longer-term bias; below suggests caution | Favor long entries only with positive momentum; avoid aggressive longs if price remains below 200SMA |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum capture | Quick shifts in momentum; can precede price moves | Use for early entries with confirmation from MACD RSI |
| macd | MACD Line | Momentum/change of trend | Positive slope and crossing above signal line strengthens uptrend; negative relation signals weakness | Look for MACD crossing above macds as entry filter; confirm with price above SMAs |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD for confirmations | Crosses with MACD indicating signal changes | Use macd vs macds cross as confirmation signal; avoid trades on MACD alone |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Increasing positive histogram signals strengthening upmove; decreasing or negative indicates caution | Use histogram expansion to validate breakout durability |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold, momentum strength | RSI rising toward overbought can precede pullbacks; divergences matter | Trigger or add-on signals when RSI breaks above/below key thresholds or shows divergence with price | 
| atr | Volatility | Risk management; stop sizing | Higher ATR means larger stops; use to adapt position size | Size positions with ATR; widen stops during high volatility and tighten during quiet periods |

Progress and next steps
- Data fetch is currently blocked by the FileNotFoundError. If you can re-enable data access or supply a data source, I’ll immediately pull AMD’s price data for the requested window and generate a concrete, data-backed indicator readout (including current values and a live interpretation).
- If you’d prefer, I can proceed with executing the 8-indicator framework above using any available alternative data source you approve (e.g., a local CSV you provide or an alternate feed), then deliver a precise trend report and table similar to the one shown here.

Would you like me to retry with the data source, or would you prefer I proceed with a purely framework-based AMD report (as above) until data access is restored?
