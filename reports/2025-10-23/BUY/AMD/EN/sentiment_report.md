Thanks for the nudge. The Reddit data fetch tool just threw a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t pull live Reddit stock sentiment right now. I’ll outline how we can proceed and give you a solid path forward, plus a ready-to-fill structure for the long-form AMD sentiment/NVDA-era analysis.

What happened
- The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like an environment/tool issue rather than user input error. I can retry after a moment, but I don’t want to block you if you want to proceed now.

Two workable paths right now
1) I retry fetching Reddit sentiment data for AMD (ticker AMD) for 2025-10-23 as soon as the tool is available again.
2) I proceed with a comprehensive qualitative AMD sentiment/news analysis for the past week using known public signals (without live Reddit pulls) and structure a robust report with trader-focused insights. This will be less data-forward in exact daily sentiment numbers but still valuable for decision-making.

If you’d like, I can start with option 2 immediately and present a detailed, trader-oriented analysis, then plug in the live Reddit data as soon as the tool is up again.

Proposed structure for the long report (AMD, past week)
- Executive snapshot
  - High-level sentiment tone (bullish, bearish, mixed) and notable consensus themes.
  - Key catalysts and events in the past week (news, earnings chatter, product rumors, supply chain signals).

- Social sentiment overview (qualitative)
  - Daily sentiment sketch: what people were talking about each day, major talking points, and any spikes in discussion volume tied to events.
  - Top sentiment drivers: AI GPU demand, data center ramp, product launches/rumors, driver/software issues, pricing, supply chain comments, stock price movement context.
  - Common buzzwords and themes observed in posts.

- News and events recap (past week)
  - Summary of notable AMD-related news: product announcements, partnerships, earnings hints, regulatory/regulatory risk, supply chain updates.
  - Compare to Nvidia/other peers where relevant (relative sentiment context).

- Market impact and interpretation
  - How sentiment and news interplay with recent price action, volatility, and options activity (if available).
  - Short- to mid-term implications for traders: catalysts to watch, risk factors, and scenario analysis (bull case, base case, bear case).

- Quantitative proxies you’d typically see (planning notes)
  - Suggested daily sentiment scoring approach (e.g., 0-1 scale per day, with weights for mention intensity, post engagement, and author credibility).
  - Key indicators to monitor going forward (AI GPU data center demand signals, OEM/enterprise chatter, driver stability feedback, supply constraints).

- Trading implications and risk controls
  - Trade ideas anchored in sentiment shifts (e.g., if AI demand signals strengthen, look for positive momentum; if chatter highlights supply chain risk, prepare for potential volatility).
  - Risk considerations: the lag between sentiment and price, potential earnings surprises, and macro tech cycles.

- Appendix: data table scaffold (for when you have daily sentiment)
  - A Markdown-friendly table template to capture daily counts, average sentiment, notable themes, and any price/volatility moves.

Markdown table scaffold (ready to fill)
- Daily Sentiment Snapshot (past 7 days)
  - Date | Mentions (rough) | Avg Sentiment (-1 to 1) | Top Themes | Price Move (%) | Volatility Signal
- Notable Events and Reactions
  - Date | Event | Sentiment Jump | Price Move | Notable Commentary

Next steps
- Please tell me which path you want:
  - Option A: I retry the Reddit data pull now and then compile a full, live-report with daily sentiment deltas and a final Markdown table (as soon as the tool responds).
  - Option B: I deliver the full qualitative AMD sentiment/news analysis for the past week right now (without granular daily Reddit numbers) plus the report structure and the Markdown table scaffold, then plug in Reddit data when the tool comes back online.

If you prefer, I can proceed with Option B immediately and then switch to Option A when the tool is available again. Just let me know which you want.
