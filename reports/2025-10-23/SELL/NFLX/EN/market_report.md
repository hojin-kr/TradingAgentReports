I’m running into an environment issue fetching NFLX data right now. The requests to retrieve the price data and to generate the 8 indicators returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the actual numeric readings to cite at the moment. I can retry immediately or wait a bit and reattempt, whichever you prefer. In the meantime, I’ll outline the 8-indicator framework I plan to use for NFLX and how I’d interpret them once the data loads. This will also give you a clear sense of what to expect when I can fetch the data.

Selected indicators (8) to use for NFLX
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these 8 indicators are complementary
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Establish the trend backbone and major dynamic support/resistance levels. The 50-day SMA reflects medium-term trend; the 200-day SMA provides a long-term trend benchmark and potential golden/death cross signals.
- close_10_ema: Captures more immediate momentum shifts and can help identify quicker entry/exit points. It’s more sensitive than the SMAs, so it’s useful for spotting early moves that confirm with longer-term trends.
- macd, macds, macdh: Together they give a coherent view of momentum and trend change:
  - MACD line (macd) crossing the signal line (macds) can signal potential entry/exit.
  - MACD histogram (macdh) shows momentum strength and potential divergences ahead of price moves.
- rsi: Provides momentum context and overbought/oversold signals with possible divergences. It helps filter trades when prices are extended in strong trends.
- atr: Adds a measure of volatility to inform risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and to gauge whether breakout moves have strength behind them.

What I’ll look for once data is available
- Trend confirmation: when price sits above both the 50SMA and 200SMA, or when the 50SMA is rising above the 200SMA (golden cross) and price respects these levels; the reverse for a death cross.
- Momentum shifts: MACD crossing above/below its signal line (macd vs macds) and histogram bars expanding/contracting (macdh) to confirm or warn of fading momentum.
- Quick momentum cues: 10 EMA crossing price or turning relative to SMAs to flag early entry/exit points, especially in conjunction with the longer-term trend.
- RSI context: RSI moving into overbought/oversold zones (with consideration of trend strength) and potential divergences with price action.
- Volatility and risk context: ATR levels rising to indicate increasing volatility (suggesting wider stops/adjusted position sizes) or decreasing volatility during consolidations.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching NFLX data and compute these 8 indicators now. If you’d like, I’ll run another fetch in a moment and provide a detailed, data-backed interpretation with a table of key takeaways.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-agnostic interpretation based on recent market context, and clearly label it as a framework-guided analysis until data loads.

Proposed output structure (once data loads)
- Short-term narrative: how current price action interacts with 50SMA/200SMA and 10EMA, with MACD/macd/macdh context, RSI stance, and ATR-driven risk framing.
- Signals matrix: potential bullish/bearish signals with confidence levels based on the combination of indicators.
- Risk notes: suggested stop placement guidance using ATR, and any caveats in choppy markets.
- Actionable ideas: potential bullish/bearish setups and risk controls.

Markdown table: Key points to monitor (structure to fill with actual data)
| Indicator | What it measures | Typical read | NFLX-specific notes (to fill after data loads) |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA; slope direction |  |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend, major level | Price above/below 200SMA; golden/death cross signals |  |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price/EMA crossover; momentum shifts |  |
| macd | Momentum trend strength | MACD line vs signal; histogram direction |  |
| macds | MACD signal line | Crossovers with MACD line trigger signals |  |
| macdh | Momentum momentum strength | Histogram magnitude/divergence cues |  |
| rsi | Relative momentum | Overbought/oversold levels and divergences |  |
| atr | Market volatility | Higher ATR = more volatility and wider stops |  |

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now and then deliver the full, data-backed report with the eight indicators, including the detailed interpretation and the final table? If you prefer, I can also run a quick qualitative pass now (clearly labeled as provisional) and then update with the exact numbers once the data loads.
