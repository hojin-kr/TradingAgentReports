Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit sentiment data for NFLX across 2025-10-23 to 2025-10-17, but the Reddit stock-info retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError (system-side issue). I can’t pull the day-by-day Reddit sentiment data right now, which prevents the full, data-driven sentiment analysis you requested.

Here’s how we can proceed, and I’ll outline what I can deliver now and what I’ll deliver once the tool is working again:

Options to proceed
- Retry now: I can retry the Reddit data pull for NFLX on the requested dates as soon as the tool is responsive again.
- Alternative data sources: If you’re okay with waiting or using non-Reddit sources, I can proceed with a comprehensive framework using whatever sources are available (e.g., public news headlines, company press releases, earnings commentary) and clearly label sentiment where Reddit data would have been.
- Hybrid approach: I can deliver a detailed analytical framework and an interim report focusing on fundamental and macro/sentiment drivers (without the day-by-day Reddit sentiment counts), then immediately slot in the Reddit sentiment once the tool is back.

What I can deliver right now (structure and content you’ll get once data is in)
- Executive snapshot
  - Brief read on NFLX current state as of late Oct 2025, key catalysts, and sentiment backdrop (from non-Reddit sources if needed).
- Sentiment framework (days and drivers)
  - A planned day-by-day sentiment map showing what factors to watch (e.g., subscriber growth, price changes, content slate, legal/regulatory issues, macro ad market, competition) and how they typically move sentiment.
- News and catalysts roundup
  - Consolidated recent company news (earnings, subscriber metrics, content strategy, pricing changes, ad-supported tier rollout, partnerships) and how each item could influence sentiment and stock reaction.
- Social sentiment interpretation (without Reddit data)
  - Qualitative read on what social sentiment would look for Netflix given typical catalysts, with caveats about data gaps.
- Implications for traders
  - Short-term trading scenarios (beat/miss expectations, guidance changes) and how sentiment nuances could amplify moves.
  - Longer-term view considering content slate durability, content cost, cash flow, and subscriber dynamics.
- Risk factors
  - Key upside/downside risks (advertising cycle, subscriber churn, content investment, competition from Disney/AMZN/Apple, regulatory scrutiny).
- Data table (Markdown at the end)
  - A structured table listing the main sentiment drivers, data source, expected directional impact, and potential trading implications.

Proposed final deliverable format
- A comprehensive long report detailing analysis, insights, and implications for traders, with:
  - Narrative analysis of sentiment drivers
  - Day-by-day or per-date sentiment signals (once data is available)
  - News digest
  - Quantitative sentiment proxies (if data becomes available)
  - Trading implications and scenarios
  - A final Markdown table organizing key points

Next steps
1) Do you want me to retry fetching Reddit data now, hoping the tool comes back online shortly?
2) Or should I proceed with the robust framework and provide a high-quality interim analysis using available sources, and then plug in the Reddit sentiment data as soon as the tool is operational?

If you prefer, I can also tailor the report to specific angles (e.g., earnings-driven seasonality, ad-supported tier impact, or content strategy implications) and prioritize those sections.

Note: I haven’t issued a FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL (BUY/HOLD/SELL) yet, since we’re still awaiting data and the analysis is incomplete. I’ll present a clear trading stance only after we have a fuller sentiment signal set.
