I attempted to fetch AAPL data and run the indicator checks, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source in this environment isn’t available right now, so I can’t generate the actual current-trend report or compute the indicator values at this moment.

What I can do now
- I can retry immediately if you’d like, or attempt again in a moment.
- If you have an alternative data source (CSV) you can share, I can analyze that locally.
- In the meantime, I can lay out a solid, complementary indicator plan (8 indicators) and explain, in detail, how I would interpret them once data is available. Then I’ll generate a fully fleshed-out, post-fetch report as soon as the data retrieval succeeds.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it gives: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s useful here: Helps confirm the broader trend context against near-term moves.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it gives: Long-term trend benchmark; signals like golden cross/death cross.
  - Why it’s useful here: Provides strategic trend confirmation and helps filter choppiness.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it gives: Responsive short-term momentum signal.
  - Why it’s useful here: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd (MACD)
  - What it gives: Momentum via MACD line crossovers and divergence.
  - Why it’s useful here: Signals trend changes when momentum shifts; works best with trend confirmation.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it gives: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD trigger signals.
  - Why it’s useful here: Reduces false positives when used with MACD and other filters.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it gives: Momentum strength and potential divergence via histogram gaps.
  - Why it’s useful here: Early momentum clues; helps gauge strength of moves and when momentum is fading.
- rsi (Momentum)
  - What it gives: Momentum with overbought/oversold readings; 70/30 thresholds; divergence signals.
  - Why it’s useful here: Identifies potential reversals or continuation in momentum; best when used with trend context.
- atr (Volatility)
  - What it gives: Average true range to gauge volatility and position sizing risk.
  - Why it’s useful here: Helps calibrate stop losses and risk per trade as volatility changes.

How I’ll present the final analysis (once data is available)
- Trend assessment: price relative to 50SMA and 200SMA; SMA cross dynamics; where price sits relative to these baselines.
- Momentum assessment: short-term (10 EMA) direction vs MACD/MACD signals and RSI positioning/divergence.
- Volatility/Risk: ATR-based context for stop placement and risk management; Bollinger bands context could be inferred if bands are available.
- Signals and Fallbacks: Confirmed signals (e.g., MACD cross with RSI condition and price above/below key SMAs) vs potential false positives in low-volatility regimes.
- Practical trading angles: identify potential entries with alignment across trend, momentum, and volatility; outline exits based on momentum fade or volatility expansion.

Appendix: Key points table (example layout)
- Indicator | Category | What it measures | Bullish signal interpretation | How to use
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend with dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA or price crossing above it supports upside; pullback near 50SMA can be a bounce point | Use with short-term signals to confirm trend direction
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA suggests bullish long-term trend; cross above 200SMA is a stronger confirmatory signal | Use for strategic positioning and risk-off checks when below
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price above 10EMA or a bullish cross with price action indicates near-term upside | Use as a timing filter with longer-term trend
- macd | MACD | Momentum and trend changes | MACD line crosses above zero or above MACD signal, bullish momentum | Confirm with RSI and price action
- macds | MACD Signal | Momentum smoothing | MACD signal line crossing MACD line in bullish direction | Use for practical entry/exit confirmation
- macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Histogram rising positive values indicate strengthening bullish momentum (and vice versa) | Watch for divergences with price
- rsi | Momentum | Relative momentum and potential reversals | RSI moves into overbought/oversold regions; divergences signal possible reversals | Use with trend context to avoid false reversals
- atr | Volatility | Market volatility level | Rising ATR implies higher volatility; helps size positions and set wider/narrower stops | Combine with stop placement and risk limits

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry fetching the data now? If you prefer, I can also wait and attempt again automatically in a short interval.
- If you have an alternative data source (CSV) or a specific date window you want analyzed (e.g., a shorter recent window like last 6–12 months), tell me and I’ll adapt.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a hypothetical walkthrough using synthetic data to illustrate exactly how the final report will look and how I’ll interpret each indicator.

Once the data access issue is resolved, I’ll deliver a detailed, nuanced report of AAPL’s current setup with the 8 indicators, including a thorough narrative of trend, momentum, and volatility conditions, plus a Markdown table like the one above summarizing the key points.
