Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the Reddit-based sentiment data for META for 2025-10-23, but the tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I attempted the call again with the same result. It looks like the data retrieval endpoint is currently unavailable on my side.

Options to move forward
- Retry now: I can try the Reddit data pull again immediately if you’d like.
- Alternate data sources: I can proceed with a thorough META analysis using other available signals (e.g., public news summaries, general social media sentiment outside Reddit, notable earnings/announcement coverage) and clearly label that Reddit data couldn’t be retrieved this round.
- Hybrid approach: I can draft a complete long-form report outline now and fill in the Reddit sentiment sections as soon as the data source is healthy again.

What I can do right now (without Reddit data)
- Provide a detailed framework for the long report you requested, including the kinds of insights I will extract, how I’ll quantify sentiment day-by-day, and how I’ll connect sentiment to recent META news and potential trading implications.
- Deliver a structured Markdown table at the end with key points, risk factors, catalysts, and takeaways once data is available.

If you’d like me to proceed with the partial approach, I’ll:
1) Compile a rigorous outline of the full report.
2) Include a placeholder section for Reddit sentiment with a note that data retrieval failed this run.
3) Start aggregating other signals (major META news from the past week, general social sentiment snapshots where available, and notable trends in AI, ads, and metaverse initiatives) to give you timely insights now.
4) Re-run the Reddit data pull as soon as the tool is back online and update the report with the day-by-day Reddit sentiment.

Would you prefer:
A) I retry the Reddit data pull now, or
B) I proceed with the non-Reddit data approach and deliver the full report with a Reddit section added once available, or
C) A clean, high-level META sentiment and news snapshot for the past week (no Reddit data), with a detailed plan for incorporating Reddit data when the tool works again?

If you want me to proceed now with option B or A, I’ll start immediately and attach a Markdown table at the end of the report.
