I attempted to fetch META data (2024-10-01 to 2025-10-23) but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError from the Yahoo Finance data fetcher. I’ve tried multiple times, and it appears to be a backend issue with the data source rather than a problem with the ticker. I can retry automatically in a few minutes, or we can proceed with a qualitative plan now and update with the actual data once the fetch succeeds. Please tell me which you prefer.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) for META
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 50-period simple moving average, a medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why suitable: Helps identify the prevailing trend in a market that has shown mixed to recovering momentum in 2024–2025; acts as a filter for entries when used with faster indicators.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 200-period simple moving average, long-term trend benchmark.
  - Why suitable: Provides macro-trend context and helps confirm regime (bullish vs bearish). Useful for spotting golden/death cross setups over a longer horizon.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 10-period exponential moving average, a responsive short-term momentum gauge.
  - Why suitable: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entries; complements the slower SMAs to filter false signals in choppy markets.
- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Difference between two EMAs to gauge momentum and trend changes.
  - Why suitable: Core momentum/trend-change signal; when used with other filters, it helps validate breakouts or reversals.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: EMA-smoothed MACD line.
  - Why suitable: Crossovers with the MACD line offer clearer entry/exit triggers and help reduce false positives when combined with price and other indicators.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: The gap between MACD and its signal line.
  - Why suitable: Visualizes momentum strength and can reveal divergence early; useful for timing in faster markets when used with other filters.
- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: Relative strength index, momentum overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why suitable: Helps flag potential reversals or pullbacks; best used alongside trend context to avoid selling in strong uptrends.
- atr (ATR)
  - What it measures: Average true range, volatility.
  - Why suitable: Guides risk management via stop placement and position sizing; adaptive to current volatility levels; critical for risk controls in META’s sometimes volatile moves.

How these indicators work together for META (contextual guidance)
- Trend and confirmation: Close_50_sma and close_200_sma establish the macro trend. A price above both suggests a bullish regime; a cross (golden cross: 50 above 200) adds conviction for longer-timeframe entries.
- Momentum timing: close_10_ema provides a quick read on near-term momentum; MACD, MACDS, and MACDH confirm or question momentum shifts with more robust crossovers and momentum strength signals.
- Momentum quality and pullbacks: RSI helps assess whether moves are extendable (not overbought) or vulnerable to a reversal, especially when the price is aligned with the primary trend.
- Risk management: ATR informs stop distances and position sizing, which is essential given META’s episodic volatility around AI news, earnings cycles, and regulatory developments.
- Redundancy avoidance: The chosen set avoids overlap (e.g., combining RSI with multiple stochastic-based momentum indicators is avoided in favor of a single RSI). The focus is on complementary trend, momentum, and volatility signals.

Trading framework example rules (when data is available)
- Long setup (in a bullish regime):
  - Price above 50_sma and 200_sma; 50_sma crossing above 200_sma (golden cross) adds conviction.
  - MACD line above MACD signal and rising; MACDH positive or increasing.
  - RSI above 50 but not in extreme overbought territory (>70) to reduce risk of a pullback.
  - Use ATR to set initial stop loss at a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.5–2x ATR) and adjust position size accordingly.
- Short setup (in a bearish regime or swing-down context):
  - Price below 50_sma and 200_sma; 50_sma crossing below 200_sma (death cross) adds conviction.
  - MACD line below MACD signal or crossing downward; MACDH negative or widening downward.
  - RSI below 50 or showing weakness with potential divergence.
  - ATR-based stops to manage risk due to potential volatility spikes.
- Timeframe considerations:
  - Use 50/200 SMA for trend framing on a daily chart; use 10 EMA, MACD family, and RSI for entry timing on the same chart; confirm with ATR for risk management.
- Risk controls:
  - In high ATR periods, widen stops modestly to avoid premature exits; in low volatility periods, tighten stops to maintain risk discipline.
  - Always verify signals with price action patterns (e.g., breakouts with volume, candlestick confirmations) in addition to these indicators.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching data now, or at a set interval you prefer. If you’d like me to proceed with the qualitative plan above right away, I can do that and then run the actual indicator analysis as soon as data retrieval succeeds.
- If you want me to proceed now with a qualitative scenario analysis for META (without the numeric data), I can provide a more granular hypothetical read based on typical META patterns in late 2024–2025 and outline concrete trading signals to watch for.

Markdown table: key indicators, purpose, and interpretation
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret for META (contextual) | Signals / rules to watch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Helps define the primary trend; use with 200SMA for regime. | Price above 50SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA suggests bullish trend; cross above for timing. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms macro regime; validates trend signals. | Price above 200SMA indicates bullish bias; price below suggests bearish bias. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Captures quick shifts; can time entries. | Price crossing above/below 10EMA signals near-term momentum shift; use with longer MA filters. |
| macd | MACD | Momentum/trend symmetry | Core momentum signal; crossovers indicate potential changes. | MACD line crossing above zero and above MACD signal supports long tilt; cross below supports short tilt. |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD | Helps confirm MACD-driven signals; reduces noise. | MACD Signal crossing MACD line opposite direction strengthens signal. |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Divergence and momentum strength visual cues. | Increasing positive histogram supports bullish momentum; increasing negative histogram supports bearish momentum. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold; momentum velocity | Contextual momentum check; avoid overreliance in strong trends. | RSI > 70 may indicate overbought risk; RSI < 30 may indicate oversold; look for divergence and trend confirmation. |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility; stop levels | Guides risk management; adapt position sizing and stops to volatility. | Rising ATR suggests wider stops; falling ATR suggests tighter stops. Use as guardrails for risk. |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and, once successful, generate a detailed, data-driven report with the exact trends for META using the eight indicators above. Would you prefer I retry immediately or proceed with the qualitative plan in the meantime?
