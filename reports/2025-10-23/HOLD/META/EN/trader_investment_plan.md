Summary decision: Hold META now. Ready to upgrade to Buy only if the planâ€™s durability criteria prove true over consecutive quarters.

Rationale
- The analysis presents credible bullish catalysts (AI-enabled ROAS uplift, multi-format monetization, moat advantages) but requires multi-quarter validation. The bear risks (macro ad softness, ROAS durability questions, Reality Labs drag, regulatory headwinds) keep the upside contingent on several moving parts performing as hoped.
- Therefore, a cautious stance remains prudent until durable, repeatable metrics confirm sustained profitability and cash-flow strength.

Key signals to confirm a Buy
- Two consecutive quarters of durable ROAS uplift attributable to AI-enabled targeting/measurement, with ARPU showing sustained growth.
- Gross margins stable or expanding with opex in line with revenue, indicating disciplined cost management.
- Reality Labs drag diminishing meaningfully or turning to profitability.
- Cash flow improves with a growing FCF margin and accelerating buybacks.
- The eight-indicator framework (trend, momentum, RSI, ATR, etc.) signals a coherent bullish regime.

Actionable plan
- Maintain neutral-to-market-weight exposure to META; avoid overweight until clearer evidence confirms the bull case.
- If the triggers above materialize, execute an upgrade to Buy with predefined position-size adjustments and a staged re-entry strategy.
- If triggers fail (ROAS durability falters over two quarters, margins compress, Reality Labs drag worsens, or macro/regulatory headwinds intensify), reassess for a more defensive stance or exit.

Risks to monitor
- Ad-market cycles and macro sensitivity; potential for ROAS gains to be non-durable.
- Regulatory/data-privacy developments affecting monetization and attribution.
- Competitive pressures from rivals impacting share of attention and pricing power.
- Reality Labs profitability trajectory and its impact on margins and cash flow.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
