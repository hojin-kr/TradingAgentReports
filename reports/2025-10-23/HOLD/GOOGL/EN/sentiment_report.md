Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit-based sentiment for GOOGL, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool issue). I’ll outline how we can proceed and what I can deliver right away, then I can retry fetching data as soon as the tool is available again.

What I can do now (without the Reddit feed):
- Provide a comprehensive, forward-looking analysis of GOOGL (Alphabet) based on recent public signals and likely drivers for stock sentiment as of 2025-10-23.
- Highlight key themes likely to influence traders: AI/product cadence, ad-market resilience, cloud growth, regulatory/regulatory risk, YouTube monetization, and capital allocation.
- Deliver a structured long-form report with nuanced sentiment interpretation, potential catalysts, and risk factors.
- End with a Markdown table summarizing key takeaways, catalysts, risks, and sentiment signals by day (once we have day-by-day data) or by theme if day-level data is not available.

Planned structure for the long report (GOOGL, current state perspective):
- Executive snapshot: high-level sentiment posture for the week, core drivers, and what traders should watch.
- Social sentiment synthesis (qualitative, with placeholder if day-by-day data is unavailable): dominant Reddit threads, micro-trends, and any notable chatter around AI capabilities, regulatory concerns, and cloud/advertising performance.
- News & events analysis (past week): any earnings chatter, product announcements, regulatory updates, leadership comments, or major partnerships.
- Fundamentals & driver analysis:
  - AI & product cadence: impact of new features, marketplaces, or developer tools; potential revenue uplift vs. costs.
  - Advertising: ad market backdrop, YouTube monetization,/regulatory changes affecting targeting and data privacy.
  - Google Cloud: growth trajectory, competition (AWS/Azure), enterprise adoption, and margins.
  - Other divisions: YouTube content ecosystem, hardware (Pixel), and play services.
  - Capital allocation: buybacks, dividends (Alphabet primarily uses buybacks), and ongoing R&D investments.
- Risk factors: antitrust/regulatory pressure in the US/EU, AI regulation, data privacy rules, supply/demand shifts in ad markets, macro uncertainties.
- Sentiment interpretation by theme: bullish/bearish/neutral signals, implied momentum, and potential catalysts.
- Trader takeaways and scenarios: base case, upside catalysts, downside risks, and hedging ideas.
- Appendix: data sources and methodology notes.

Proposed next step if you’d like me to push forward now:
- I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using publicly known signals (without the Reddit feed) and clearly label what is inferred versus what would come from the Reddit data.
- Then, once the Reddit tool is functioning again, I’ll integrate the day-by-day sentiment data and update the report accordingly, including a final Markdown table of key points.

Questions to tailor the output:
- Do you want me to proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis now (no Reddit feed), or would you prefer I keep trying to fetch the Reddit data and only publish once I have that source?
- If you want a purely data-driven table, should I format the Markdown table to reflect: date, sentiment score (bullish/bearish/neutral), headline themes, and implied action cues (e.g., caution, buy-the-dip, etc.)?

If you’re ready for a best-effort qualitative analysis now, I’ll produce the full report outline plus a concise executive summary and a ready-to-paste Markdown table with key themes and potential catalysts. If you want me to keep retrying the Reddit data fetch, I’ll do so and update you as soon as it returns.
