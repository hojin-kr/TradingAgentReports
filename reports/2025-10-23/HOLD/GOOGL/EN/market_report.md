I’m running into a data retrieval issue right now. The attempts to fetch Yahoo Finance data for GOOGL via get_YFin_data returned a FileNotFoundError, which means I can’t generate the exact indicator values or a trend report at this moment. This looks like an environment/backend problem rather than a user input issue. I can:

- Retry fetching the data now, or
- Try a smaller date window (e.g., the last 6–12 months) or a different ticker variant (GOOGL vs GOOG), or
- Proceed with a framework and plan so we can generate the full report as soon as data loads.

If you’d like, I can retry immediately. Let me know your preference (retry now, or adjust the window/ticker).

Proposed indicator set for GOOGL (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
Rationale: These provide a balanced view of trend direction, momentum, volatility, and key support/resistance levels without overlapping too much. Once data restores, I’ll generate the full integrated report using these exact indicators.

- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Role: Momentum and trend-change signal; crossovers of MACD line and signal line help identify shifts in direction.
  - What to look for: MACD line crossing above/below the signal line; zero-line crossings; convergence/divergence with price.

- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Role: Momentum strength via MACD histogram; helps spot divergence and strength of moves.
  - What to look for: Increasing histogram as momentum strengthens in the direction of the move; decreasing histogram signals weakening momentum.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Role: Overbought/oversold momentum gauge; divergence can hint at reversals.
  - What to look for: RSI crossing above/below thresholds (e.g., 70/30) and any bullish/bearish divergences with price.

- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Role: Measures market volatility; informs risk management and position sizing.
  - What to look for: Rising ATR suggests higher volatility and potentially wider stops; falling ATR suggests consolidation.

- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Intermediate-term trend indicator; dynamic support/resistance.
  - What to look for: Price above/below the 50-day SMA indicating uptrend/downtrend; use for contextual trend alignment.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm overarching market regime and identify major trend signals.
  - What to look for: Price above/below the 200-day SMA; golden/death cross considerations when paired with other signals.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Role: Responsive short-term momentum signal; quick shifts in trend direction.
  - What to look for: Price cross above/below the 10-EMA as a potential early entry/exit signal; use with longer-term filters to reduce noise.

- boll_ub
  - Category: Volatility Indicators (Bollinger Band Upper)
  - Role: Upper-bound breakout/overbought proxy; highlights potential reversal or breakout zones when aligned with other signals.
  - What to look for: Price touching or closing near/above the upper band; confirm with momentum signals (MACD/RSI) to reduce false positives.

Notes on usage and interpretation
- The eight indicators together cover: trend (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum (MACD, MACD histogram, RSI), volatility (ATR, Bollinger upper band), and breakout/overbought context (upper band).
- Avoid relying on a single indicator; look for confluence across multiple signals before acting.
- In a stock like GOOGL, where systems and news can drive fast moves, combining a longer-term trend (200 SMA) with a quicker entry signal (10 EMA plus MACD) and a volatility filter (ATR) can help manage risk and improve timing.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now to generate the actual indicator values and produce the full, data-driven report? If you prefer, I can also try a narrower window (e.g., last 12 months) or switch to GOOG/GOOGL to see if the backend behaves differently. Here’s a ready-to-use Markdown table summarizing the plan for easy reference:

| Indicator | Category | Role | What to look for | Signals/Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend-change signal | MACD line vs. signal line cross; zero-line crossings | Long when MACD rises above signal; short when MACD falls below signal |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction; divergence with price | Increasing histogram confirms momentum; decreasing signals weakening momentum |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold and divergence | 70/30 thresholds; price-RSI divergences | Overbought/oversold zones; watch for divergences as reversals |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility and risk management | Rising/falling volatility levels | Use to size positions and place stops; adjust risk as volatility changes |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Intermediate-term trend | Price relative to 50-SMA; crossovers | Above 50-SMA suggests uptrend; below implies downtrend; use with other signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend | Price relative to 200-SMA; regime context | Price above indicates long-term uptrend; below indicates long-term downtrend; align with other indicators |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price relative to 10-EMA; quick crossovers | Price above 10-EMA signals short-term bullishness; below signals bearishness; use for entry timing |
| boll_ub | Bollinger Bands | Upper-bound breakout/overbought context | Price near/above upper band; confluence with momentum | Potential breakout or reversal zone; confirm with MACD/RSI to reduce false signals |

If you want me to proceed with retrying the data fetch now, say “Retry,” and I’ll attempt again immediately. If you’d prefer a different window or ticker variant, tell me which one to try.
