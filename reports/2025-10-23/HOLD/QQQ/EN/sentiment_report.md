I hit an internal error fetching Reddit data for QQQ on 2025-10-23. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t currently have the Reddit-based sentiment/news feed to build the full report.

What would you like me to do next?
- Retry fetch now (in case the issue is transient).
- Try alternative data sources (if you’re open to me using other social platforms or news feeds, though I currently only have the Reddit tool wired in).
- Proceed with a structured plan and a placeholder framework so we can fill in data as soon as the fetch succeeds.

Here’s a concrete plan I can execute once the data flow works, or you can approve parts of it to proceed with now:

Plan for the long-form report (QQQ, past week, as of 2025-10-23)
- Executive snapshot
  - What changed over the past week in social sentiment and headlines.
  - Any notable price move or volume spike tied to sentiment shifts.
- Social sentiment analysis (daily granularity)
  - Collect: Reddit posts/comments, other major social channels if available (mentions, sentiment scores, top themes).
  - Metrics: daily sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative proportions), mention volume, average engagement, notable spikes.
  - Top topics/themes by day (e.g., tech sector signals, macro data, ETF flows, AI exposure).
- Public news/announcements (past week)
  - Summary of any macro, tech sector, or ETF-related news affecting QQQ.
  - Correlation of headlines with sentiment shifts.
- Contextual drivers and interpretation
  - How sentiment aligns with macro environment, tech sector catalysts, or ETF-specific flows.
  - Potential risk/hinge events to watch (earnings, rate expectations, inflation data, tech earnings season if applicable).
- Implications for traders and investors
  - Short-term spread of sentiment vs. fundamentals.
  - Possible trading ideas (range-bound vs. breakout considerations, hedging signals) tied to sentiment trajectories.
- Risks and caveats
  - Data availability gaps, potential biases in social data, ETF-specific vs. component stock sentiment.
- Makrdown table
  - A concise end-table summarizing key points, drivers, sentiment direction, and suggested actions.

If you want me to proceed with a partial output now (without Reddit data), I can provide:
- A robust outline plus a placeholder data schema.
- A hypothetical example of what the daily sentiment section would look like, so you can see the format and fill in actual numbers later.

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the outline/placeholder plan?
- If you have any preferred data sources beyond Reddit (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, major financial news outlets), let me know and I’ll tailor the plan accordingly once I can access them.
