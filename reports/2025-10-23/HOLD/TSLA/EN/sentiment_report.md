I’m sorry—the Reddit stock info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError and isn’t producing data right now. I can’t fetch the latest TSLA sentiment data at the moment due to this backend issue.

Here are a few options to move forward:

- Retry now or after a brief wait: I can retry the Reddit data pull in a couple minutes and then assemble the full analysis (social sentiment, recent news, and implications for traders) with a Markdown table at the end.
- Proceed with a plan and template: I can deliver a comprehensive analysis framework and the exact sections I’ll fill in once the data tool is healthy again, so you know what to expect.
- Use alternative sources (if you approve): I can provide a qualitative framework and summarize publicly known TSLA developments from mainstream news and public sentiment indicators that don’t rely on the failing tool. This would be less granular than the planned Reddit-driven sentiment analysis but still useful for traders.

If you’d like, I can immediately:
- Prepare the detailed analysis framework (sections, key indicators to track, and how I’ll present sentiment trends daily).
- Or attempt a quick retry now and report back with the results as soon as the tool becomes available.

Please tell me which option you prefer, or how you’d like to proceed.
