I attempted to fetch TSLA data and run the selected indicators, but the data retrieval infrastructure returned a FileNotFoundError. I couldn’t pull the CSV from Yahoo Finance or compute the indicator values in this session. If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now, or you can re-run when the environment is available. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan with a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators and how to interpret them for TSLA given its typical volatility and catalyst-driven moves.

Selected indicators (8 total) and why they’re complementary for TSLA
- macd
  - Why: Momentum-driven trend signal. The MACD line crossing above/below the signal line helps identify potential trend changes. Useful for catching mid-trajectory shifts in TSLA’s volatile moves.
- macds
  - Why: The MACD Signal line provides a smoothed confirmation of MACD crossovers. Helps reduce false entries by requiring a corroborating signal from the MACD’s smoothing.
- rsi
  - Why: Momentum gauge for overbought/oversold conditions. TSLA often experiences sharp pullbacks after extended runs; RSI helps flag potential reversals when combined with trend context.
- atr
  - Why: Volatility measure. TSLA can spike on news; ATR helps gauge risk and position sizing, and assists in setting stop levels relative to current volatility.
- boll
  - Why: Bollinger Middle (20-day SMA) as a dynamic benchmark. Price interaction with the middle line, and movement relative to the bands, helps assess breakout or mean-reversion possibilities in TSLA’s range dynamics.
- close_50_sma
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and support/resistance. A practical benchmark to see whether price is above/below a key moving-average baseline.
- close_200_sma
  - Why: Long-term trend context. Useful for identifying whether TSLA is in a longer-term uptrend or downtrend, and for watching for major crossovers (golden/death cross concepts).
- close_10_ema
  - Why: Responsive, short-term momentum filter. Helps catch faster shifts in price action, which is valuable for a stock with TSLA’s volatility, especially for timely entries/exits when used with longer-term filters.

How to interpret these indicators together for TSLA (once you have the data)
- Trend and momentum alignment
  - If price is above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma, and close_10_ema is also above price, this suggests a bullish, momentum-driven trend. Confirm with macd > macds and macd rising.
  - If price is below both moving averages (50 and 200) and the 10-EMA is below price, consider a bearish regime. Confirm with macd < macds and macd trending lower.
- Momentum confirmation and potential reversals
  - RSI rising toward overbought (near 70-75) in a strong uptrend should be watched for a pending pullback; look for MACD consistency (macd > macds) to support the trend, but use RSI divergence if price continues to push higher while RSI diverges lower.
  - RSI dipping toward oversold (near 30-35) in a downtrend can signal a potential short-term bounce, but confirm with MACD crossing or turning up.
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising indicates increasing volatility; consider widening stops or reducing position size accordingly. If ATR is contracting while price holds above key moving averages, it may indicate consolidation and a less risky setup.
- Bollinger middle dynamics and breakout tendencies
  - Price crossing above/below boll and moving toward the bands can signal breakout or mean-reversion. If MACD is positive and price breaks the upper band with RSI not overbought, it may indicate a continuation rally; a break with RSI overbought could indicate a pullback or consolidation zone.
- Practical entry/exit cues (rule-of-thumb)
  - Long setup: price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD rising with macd > macds, RSI not in overbought extreme, price testing or breaking above boll, and ATR at a comfortable level to manage risk.
  - Short setup: price below 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD turning down with macd < macds, RSI headed toward overbought territory on a retrace, ATR rising signaling more aggressive risk controls.

Important caveat
- TSLA is a high-volatility name with frequent news-driven moves. Treat entries with caution, use smaller initial positions when ATR is elevated, and rely on a confluence of signals (not a single indicator) before taking a trade.

Next steps (how I can help once data is available)
1) Re-run the data fetch and compute the 8 indicators for TSLA with the exact parameters I listed.
2) Deliver a full, data-driven trend report with:
   - Current price relative to the 50SMA, 200SMA, and 10-EMA
   - MACD line and MACD signal values and cross status
   - RSI value and any divergence notes
   - ATR value and recent volatility trend
   - Boll middle level and price’s position relative to bands
   - Any explicit long/short setup signals based on the combination of signals
3) Provide a concise trading plan (entry, stop, target, risk) based on the observed confluence.
4) If you want, I can also include optional variants with boll_ub or boll_lb for breakout/oversold-conditions analysis.

Markdown summary table
| Indicator | What it measures in TSLA context | How to use for decision-making |
|---|---|---|
| macd | Momentum and trend strength; potential trend changes | Look for MACD line crossing above/below MACD signal as entry/exit confirmation; use with other signals |
| macds | MACD signal smoothing for confirmation | Use to confirm MACD crosses; reduces false positives |
| rsi | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold levels | Use 70/30 thresholds; watch for divergences and confluence with trend direction |
| atr | Market volatility and risk level | Higher ATR suggests larger stops; adjust position sizing accordingly |
| boll | Price relative to 20-SMA middle; dynamic benchmark | Use to assess breakout/mean-reversion potential; combined with bands for breakouts |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction | Price above vs below 50SMA informs trend bias; watch for crossovers with price |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend context | Trend confirmation; golden/death-cross dynamics; strategic bias |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum and rapid shifts | Quick momentum filter; helps identify early entry/exit when aligned with longer-term signals |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching TSLA data now and then provide a full, data-backed report with exact readings for each of these indicators. Please let me know if you want me to proceed with another data fetch attempt.
