Decision: Hold

Rationale
- Near-term catalysts for TSLA remain uncertain, particularly around FSD monetization timing, regulatory approvals, and gross-margin trajectory amid ongoing capex and commodity exposure.
- Bull case remains compelling over the longer horizon: expanding EV demand, energy/storage synergy, and software-enabled monetization could drive durable upside.
- Bear-case risks—financing headwinds, intensified competition, and potential margin pressure—argue against a decisive buy right now, while a complete sell would ignore meaningful optionality and the long-run moat.
- This aligns with a prudent, balanced stance: participate in potential upside while maintaining risk controls and avoiding overexposure to near-term volatility.

Strategic actions (practical implementation)
- If you already own TSLA:
  - Consider a collar to protect downside and retain upside potential:
    - Buy a protective put at a strike near or just below a meaningful support level.
    - Sell an out-of-the-money call at a higher strike to finance the put and reduce cost of protection.
  - If you’re overweight, modestly trim exposure to reduce concentration risk while preserving a core position for upside.
- If you do not own TSLA:
  - Avoid a large, directional long build now. Opt for hedged or phased exposure:
    - Use defined-risk options (e.g., long-dated put spreads or small long-dated calls) to gain optionality with downside protection.
- Position sizing and risk management:
  - Keep TSLA as a modest portion of a diversified EV/tech allocation.
  - Establish explicit risk triggers and stop/exit levels if margins deteriorate, demand signals weaken, or regulatory setbacks appear.
- Monitoring plan:
  - Track FSD milestones and any announced monetization timelines, plus regulatory developments.
  - Monitor gross margin trajectory, energy/backlog dynamics, and commodity/capex exposure across gigafactory expansions.
  - Use a multi-factor lens (delivery trends, software adoption signals, and cost structure) rather than a single catalyst.

Entry/exit triggers
- Reassess if FSD monetization becomes credibly near-term with measurable revenue impact and regulatory clarity, or if gross margins stabilize/improve despite macro noise.
- Consider scaling into a fuller long if the stock shows a sustained uptrend with improving margins and clear, independent catalysts within a 6–12 month window.
- If near-term demand/mix signals deteriorate meaningfully or regulatory risk materializes, be prepared to reduce exposure or shift toward a more defensive stance.
