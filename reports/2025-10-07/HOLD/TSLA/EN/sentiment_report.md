Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for TSLA over the requested range (2025-10-01 to 2025-10-07), but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a temporary issue with the data source or the tool wrapper, not with TSLA itself.

What I can do next
- Retry the Reddit data pulls now and report back with a day-by-day sentiment breakdown, top subreddits, and notable post themes.
- If you’d prefer, I can also proceed with a robust analysis using what I can access from other sources (news headlines, public sentiment signals) once you confirm you’re okay with me supplementing Reddit data when it’s unavailable.
- Alternatively, you can provide an alternative data source or allow me to pull from a broader set of social channels if you have access to them.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A comprehensive long-form report detailing:
  - Daily sentiment trajectory for TSLA on Reddit (by date: 2025-10-01 through 2025-10-07), with sentiment scores (e.g., positive/neutral/negative proportions), notable spikes, and the drivers behind spikes (announcements, product news, earnings chatter, driverless tech discussions, etc.).
  - Narrative themes by day (e.g., Model updates, Cybertruck chatter, price targets, supply chain chatter, competition with legacy automakers, regulatory news).
  - Key subreddits and influential posts/users influencing sentiment during the week.
  - How social sentiment aligned with or diverged from any public news events or company updates in that window.
  - Practical implications for traders:
    - Short-term sentiment-driven price risk/volatility signals
    - Potential entry/exit windows if sentiment catalysts align with price moves
    - Risk factors to watch (narrative fatigue, overbought chatter, influencer amplification)
  - Summary conclusions and actionable takeaways for traders and investors.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points, including:
  - Date
  - Daily sentiment sentiment score or range
  - Top narrative themes
  - Notable catalysts
  - Implications for TSLA positioning

Proposed table structure for quick reference (will be populated with actual data once retrieved)
- Date | Daily Sentiment | Top Themes | Notable Catalysts | Trading Implications

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now and proceed with the full long-form report once I have the data, or
- Proceed with a plan that uses alternative sources in parallel while we retry Reddit?

If you want me to retry immediately, I’ll run the Reddit data pull for TSLA again and start compiling the day-by-day sentiment report as soon as I get responses.
