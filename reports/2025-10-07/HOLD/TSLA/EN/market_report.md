I tried to fetch TSLA data and run the indicator analyses, but data retrieval failed due to an internal file-not-found error. I’m unable to produce the live trend specifics right now. If you’d like, I can retry in a moment or proceed with a robust, action-oriented indicator framework you can use as soon as the data becomes available. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 complementary indicators for TSLA, with rationale and how to use them together to extract nuanced insights given Tesla’s typical volatility and event-driven price moves.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_200_sma
  - Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark to gauge the major directional context for TSLA (e.g., overall bullish or bearish backdrop).
  - How to use: Price trading above 200 SMA suggests a long-term uptrend; below indicates a possible downtrend. Look for persistent price-spread around the 200 SMA as a trend confirmation filter.

- close_50_sma
  - Rationale: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Complements the 200 SMA to detect more timely trend shifts.
  - How to use: Crossovers with price or with 200 SMA can signal trend changes; use with MACD and RSI to filter signals in choppy markets.

- close_10_ema
  - Rationale: Responsive short-term momentum indicator to capture quicker shifts in price action.
  - How to use: Use as a timing aid for entries/exits in conjunction with longer-term moving averages to avoid whipsaws in high-volatility conditions typical of TSLA.

- macd
  - Rationale: Momentum gauge showing differences between two EMAs; helps identify trend changes and strength.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crosses of the signal line, plus divergence against price. Confirm with RSI and price above/below moving averages.

- macds
  - Rationale: The MACD signal line; smoothing helps reduce false positives and provides clearer crossovers.
  - How to use: Use crossovers (MACD vs. MACD Signal) as triggers, but require alignment with price position relative to major SMAs for reliability.

- rsi
  - Rationale: Momentum oscillator signaling overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals.
  - How to use: Typical thresholds 70/30. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated; look for bearish/bullish divergence with price and corroborate with trend indicators (SMA lines, MACD).

- boll
  - Rationale: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a dynamic baseline; helps interpret price relative to recent volatility.
  - How to use: Price touching or crossing the middle band can indicate normal pullbacks; use with upper/lower bands to spot breakouts or reversals when volatility expands or contracts.

- atr
  - Rationale: True volatility measure to inform risk management and position sizing.
  - How to use: Use ATR to set stop-loss distances and adapt position sizes to current volatility. A rising ATR suggests wider stops; a compressing ATR may precede a breakout.

How to interpret these together (practical framework)
- Trend confirmation: Check price relative to 200 SMA and 50 SMA.
  - If price is above both and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA (a bullish alignment), look for long setups.
  - If price is below both with a bearish alignment, consider short or protective strategies.
- Timing with momentum: Use macd/macds in tandem with close_10_ema.
  - A bullish signal occurs when MACD crosses up and price confirms with a rising 10 EMA and price staying above/near the 50 SMA.
  - A bearish signal occurs when MACD crosses down and price starts to pull below the 50 SMA, with RSI showing fading momentum (or forming bearish divergence).
- Momentum cautions: RSI behavior in TSLA can be extreme in trend days or during news-driven moves.
  - In uptrends, look for pullbacks into or near the 50 SMA with RSI maintaining constructive levels (not dipping into oversold). In downtrends, RSI can stay oversold longer; prioritize MACD and price-position signals.
- Volatility and risk: Use ATR to tailor stops and position sizes.
  - A rising ATR warrants wider stops and potentially larger buffers around swing highs/lows, reducing premature stopouts in volatile sessions.
- Breakouts and volatility: Bollinger bands help gauge volatility regimes and potential breakout zones.
  - When price rides the upper band with expanding Bollinger bands and strong MACD momentum, it may indicate a continuation. When price tests the middle band after a squeeze, wait for a breakout confirmation with MACD and RSI.
- Confirmation layering: Do not rely on a single signal.
  - Favor setups where price is above 200 SMA, MACD shows positive momentum, RSI supports the direction (not in extreme overbought/oversold), and ATR confirms a compatible volatility regime.

What to expect once data is available
- With TSLA’s recent history of rapid moves around product news, earnings, and guidance shifts, expect frequent crossovers between short-term (10 EMA) and longer-term (50/200 SMA) indicators. Use MACD/macd as momentum filters, RSI for divergence checks, Bollinger context for volatility-driven entries, and ATR-based risk controls to manage position sizes and stops.

Next steps
- Retry fetching the data so I can generate a live, data-driven trend report using this 8-indicator framework.
- Alternatively, if you want, I can proceed with a qualitative, scenario-based interpretation now and plug in live values once the data is back, then provide concrete entry/exit signals.

Key points at a glance
- Focus on both trend (200/50 SMA) and momentum (10 EMA, MACD pair) to navigate TSLA’s volatility.
- Add RSI for momentum context and Bollinger for volatility-aware entries.
- Use ATR for dynamic risk management.

Key points table
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - Insight: Long-term trend benchmark; confirms overarching market direction.
  - Signal usage: Price above = bullish macro trend; price below = bearish macro trend; use with MACD/RSI for timing.
  - Caveat: Lags price; best for strategic context rather than precise entries.
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - Insight: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Signal usage: Crossovers with price or 200 SMA help hint at trend changes.
  - Caveat: Still lagging; confirm with faster indicators.
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - Insight: Short-term momentum shifts.
  - Signal usage: Timely entry/exit cues when aligned with longer-term trends.
  - Caveat: Prone to noise in choppy markets; use as timing aid, not sole signal.
- Indicator: macd
  - Insight: Momentum strength and trend change potential.
  - Signal usage: Crossovers with macds and divergence with price offer actionable signals.
  - Caveat: Needs corroboration in low-volatility regimes.
- Indicator: macds
  - Insight: Smoother momentum signal; reduces false positives.
  - Signal usage: Crosses with macd to trigger trades; confirm with price action.
  - Caveat: Slight lag; combine with price-position indicators.

- Indicator: atr
  - Insight: Realized market volatility for risk management and sizing.
  - Signal usage: Set stops and adjust position sizes according to current volatility.
  - Caveat: Reactive measure; not a market direction signal alone.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now or proceed with a scenario-based interpretation using typical TSLA dynamics until the data tool comes back online? If you approve, I can also attempt a targeted retry immediately and then deliver a full, data-backed trend report as soon as the fetch succeeds.
