Thanks for the prompt. It looks like the data fetches failed on the data tools (FileNotFoundError from the Finnhub/SimFin calls). I couldn’t retrieve TSLA’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the latest quarterly balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement data right now.

What I can do next
- Retry the data pulls now if you’d like. If the environment still has issues, I’ll switch to a fallback plan using the most recent public summaries I can access and clearly mark any data gaps.
- Alternatively, we can proceed with a detailed methodology and a structured report skeleton, and fill in the numbers as soon as the data calls succeed.
- If you prefer a different cadence (e.g., focus only on the latest quarterly data or extend to annual data), tell me and I’ll adapt.

Proposed plan for the full fundamental report (once data is available)
- Company profile
  - Ticker, exchange, sector/industry, headquarters, business segments.
- Financial snapshot (latest quarter and year-to-date)
  - Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EBITDA, basic/diluted EPS.
  - Cash from operations, capex, free cash flow.
- Balance sheet (most recent)
  - Total assets, total liabilities, equity.
  - Cash & equivalents, net debt, long-term debt, liquidity metrics.
- Cash flow statement (most recent)
  - CFO, CFI, CFF, resulting free cash flow.
  - Key uses of cash (R&D, capex, acquisitions, debt repayments).
- Income statement trends (historical context)
  - Margins (gross, operating, net), margin progression QoQ/YoY.
  - Earnings quality indicators (non-cash adjustments, one-time items).
- Profitability and efficiency
  - ROE, ROA, ROIC, asset turnover, working capital dynamics.
- Leverage and liquidity
  - Debt/EBITDA, current ratio, quick ratio, interest coverage.
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Overall sentiment direction, notable insider buys/sells, possible implications.
- Qualitative considerations and risk factors
  - Competitive landscape (EV, energy/auto tech trends for TSLA), supply chain, regulatory exposure, raw materials.
- Traders’ takeaways
  - Key drivers, potential catalysts, caveats, and scenario considerations.

Proposed Markdown table to organize key points (template)
Note: I’ll populate this table with actual values once the data pulls succeed.

- Summary table (example structure)
| Key Point | TSLA Value (latest quarter) | Q/Q Change | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Revenue | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Gross Margin | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Operating Margin | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Net Income | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| EPS (diluted) | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| CFO | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Free Cash Flow | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Total Assets | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Total Liabilities | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Net Debt | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Insider Sentiment (15d) | N/A | N/A | Data pending |
| Notable Insider Transactions | N/A | N/A | Data pending |

What I need from you
- Tell me: would you like me to retry the data pulls now, or switch to the fallback plan (using public summaries with placeholders where data is missing)?
- If you want me to retry, I’ll run the data requests again immediately and then deliver a comprehensive TSLA fundamental report with a detailed appendix and the final Markdown table.

If you prefer, I can also proceed with a qualitative TSLA fundamentals outline based on typical data points and risk considerations, clearly labeling any gaps due to the current data retrieval issue.
