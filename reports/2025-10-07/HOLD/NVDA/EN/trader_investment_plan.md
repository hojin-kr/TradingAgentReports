Here’s a concise, data-driven assessment aligned with the provided plan and current market logic.

Decision: HOLD NVDA right now

Rationale
- Bull case intact: Nvidia remains central to AI infrastructure with durable data-center demand, a sticky CUDA/software moat, and expanding adjacencies (edge, automotive, licensing). Long-run upside remains credible.
- Near-term risks elevated: Revenue visibility is not as robust as ideal, given potential OpenAI-like dependence, premium valuation with possible multiple compression, regulatory/macroeconomic headwinds, and data/signal outages that raise the risk of misreading momentum.
- Data gaps amplify risk: With outages in price history and sentiment data, the probability of mis-timing moves increases. A cautious stance preserves optionality.

Actionable plan for current NVDA holders
- Trim exposure: If you’re already overweight, reduce to a modest single-digit percentage of portfolio to lower beta while remaining positioned for upside.
- Hedging: Implement a conservative hedge (protective put or a collar) to cap downside while preserving some upside potential.
- Risk controls: Apply a disciplined stop framework (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR trailing stop or a fixed percentage stop based on your risk tolerance). Consider a rising stop if price action shows constructive momentum but remains within a cautious risk envelope.
- Re-entry criteria (to shift from Hold to Buy): Revisit only on convergent, data-backed signals:
  - Price action: sustained uptrend with price above 50-day and 200-day moving averages, rising/positive volume, MACD turning positive.
  - Momentum: RSI in a healthy range (not overbought) with MACD histogram positive.
  - Volatility: ATR indicative of controlled risk, not spiking.
  - Sentiment: neutral-to-bullish readings aligned with price action; no bearish divergences.
- Catalysts to watch: explicit data-center mix commentary, software monetization cadence, OpenAI-like deal updates, regulatory/export-control developments.

Data restoration and review plan
- Once data streams return, re-run the full 8-indicator framework (price action, trend, momentum, volatility, sentiment, etc.) to confirm readiness for re-entry.
- Avoid overreacting to a single signal; require multi-signal confirmation before any Buy decision.

If you’re not currently long
- Do not initiate a large new position at current levels. Wait for data-driven confirmation signals before establishing a starter position, then scale in on pullbacks with the same risk discipline outlined above.

Final assessment
- The Hold stance preserves capital while you await clearer data and momentum signals. If data confirms sustained AI capex momentum and multi-signal confirmation arises, a move toward Buy can be revisited with a staged approach.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
