I ran into an internal error when trying to fetch Reddit stock news for NVDA on 2025-10-07 (the tool returned a FileNotFoundError). I can retry the Reddit data pull, or switch to a broader data gathering approach if you’d like. In the meantime, here’s a comprehensive plan and a ready-to-fill report framework so we can dive in as soon as the data comes back.

What I can deliver right now (framework and plan)
- Purpose: Provide a deep dive into NVDA's current state using social media sentiment (primarily Reddit, plus other sources if available), and recent company news, to help traders assess potential catalysts and risk.
- Data in scope (when available): Reddit posts and comments mentioning NVDA (past week), recent NVDA news headlines, notable social sentiment shifts by day, and key themes (AI cycle, supply/demand dynamics, regulatory considerations, etc.).
- Output structure: A long-form report with actionable insights for traders, followed by a concise summary table (Markdown) of key points.

What the final report will cover (once data is loaded)
- Executive snapshot
  - A succinct read on sentiment momentum (positive/neutral/negative) and any notable sentiment reversals across the past 7 days.
  - Snapshot of any major NVDA news events in the week and how the market participants are reacting.
- Daily sentiment rundown
  - Day-by-day sentiment scores (e.g., +1 to -1 scale or similar) with the top 3 themes driving sentiment each day.
- Top themes and post-level color
  - Cream-of-the-crop Reddit posts and reactions: bullish catalysts (AI demand, data center expansions, partnerships), bearish concerns (regulatory risk, supply chain, valuation concerns).
- News context
  - Summary of the week’s notable NVDA news items (earnings timing, product launches, regulatory developments, competitor moves) and their potential market impact.
- Sentiment-to-price intuition
  - Analysis of how sentiment shifts align with price action and volume, including any lead-lag indicators observed in prior similar cycles.
- Risks and catalysts for the next 1–4 weeks
  - Key risks (regulatory, antitrust attention, supply/demand shocks, macro headwinds) and potential catalysts (earnings, product announcements, market-wide AI adoption signals).
- Trader-oriented takeaways
  - Implications for options activity, potential entry/exit windows, and risk controls based on sentiment and news momentum.

What I need from you to proceed fastest
- Do you want me to retry fetching the Reddit data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the report framework and fill in details once data returns?
- If you’d like, I can broaden the sentiment sources beyond Reddit (e.g., X/Twitter sentiment, StockTwits, major news outlets) once you authorize or provide access to those feeds.

Appendix: Markdown table (to be filled after data is loaded)
I’ll append a table like this at the end of the final report, once the data is in. You can copy-paste or run with your preferred analytics tool.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Next steps
- Tell me how you’d like to proceed:
  - Retry Reddit data fetch now?
  - Proceed with the framework and populate later?
  - Expand data sources beyond Reddit (and which sources you prefer)?

I’m ready to run the Reddit data retrieval again as soon as you confirm, and I’ll deliver the full, analysis-rich report with the Markdown table appended.
