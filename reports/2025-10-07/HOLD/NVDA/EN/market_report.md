I attempted to fetch NVDA data and run the indicators, but I’m seeing a FileNotFoundError in the data retrieval layer right now. That means I can’t pull NVDA’s price history or compute the indicators at the moment. I can retry immediately, or proceed with a well‑justified indicator plan and you can confirm once data is back. How would you like to proceed? Options:
- I retry data retrieval now and then output a full, data-driven report.
- I proceed with a pre-defined 8-indicator framework (below) and explain how to interpret signals once data is available.

Proposed 8-indicator framework for NVDA (diversified, complementary, non-redundant)
Rationale: NVDA is a high-volatility, trend-sensitive stock with strong momentum and notable moves around tech cycles and earnings. The selected indicators balance trend direction, momentum, volatility, and risk management to help capture entries, exits, and position sizing.

1) close_50_sma (50-period simple moving average)
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helpful to gauge the prevailing trend and potential pullbacks within an uptrend.
- Signals to watch: Price above 50SMA with a rising slope supports long bias; a cross below could indicate a trend weakening.

2) close_200_sma (200-period simple moving average)
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Confirms broader market context (golden cross or death cross scenarios).
- Signals to watch: Price and/or 50SMA above 200SMA supports a bullish frame; a cross of 50SMA over/under 200SMA (golden/death cross) is a strategic hint, not a timing signal.

3) close_10_ema (10-period exponential moving average)
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why: Responsive short-term momentum indicator. Captures quick shifts that can precede bigger moves.
- Signals to watch: Price crossing above/below the 10 EMA can signal near-term momentum shifts; use with longer-term trend filters (50SMA/200SMA) to reduce noise.

4) macd (MACD line)
- Category: MACD Related
- Why: Momentum gauge showing differences of EMAs; useful for spotting trend changes.
- Signals to watch: MACD line crossing above zero or crossing the MACD signal line can indicate rising momentum; divergences with price can warn of reversals.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- Category: MACD Related
- Why: Smoothing of MACD; helps reduce noise when confirming momentum crossovers.
- Signals to watch: MACD crossing above/below its signal line provides potentially more reliable trade triggers when aligned with MACD line direction.

6) rsi (RSI)
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- Why: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold levels. Helpful for gauging exhaustion vs. continuation within a trend.
- Signals to watch: RSI approaching or crossing 70/30 thresholds as a potential reversal flag when price trend is at extremes; watch for bullish/bearish divergence with price.

7) boll (Bollinger Middle)
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- Why: 20-period moving average that forms the basis for Bollinger Bands; helps contextualize price deviation from a mean.
- Signals to watch: Price trading near/above the middle line with widening bands can indicate expanding volatility and potential breakout zones; use with upper/lower bands for breakout/reversal cues.

8) atr (Average True Range)
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- Why: Measures current volatility to inform risk management (position sizing, stop placement).
- Signals to watch: Rising ATR implies increasing volatility and may justify wider stops; falling ATR could indicate consolidation and tighter risk controls.

Notes on interpretation in NVDA context
- Trend confirmation: Look for alignment among 50SMA, 200SMA, and price. A bullish posture is strongest when price sits above both SMAs with the 50SMA above the 200SMA and the 50SMA slope turning up.
- Momentum confirmation: Use MACD and RSI together. A MACD bullish cross near or above zero alongside RSI not yet in overbought territory strengthens a potential entry; if RSI is overbought but MACD lines are still rising, be cautious and seek a pullback or tighter risk controls.
- Volatility and risk: ATR helps you size positions and place stops that adapt to current market swings. Boll middle provides a reference for mean reversion context, while breaks beyond the upper/lower bands can signal breakout or reversal setups when supported by MACD/RSI.
- Entries/exits: Favor entries when multiple signals align (trend confirmation from SMAs, momentum lift from MACD, and RSI confirming momentum without extreme overbought levels). Use ATR-based stops to adapt to volatility, and consider Bollinger bands to gauge breakout strength in NVDA’s relatively volatile price action.

Proposed next steps (data-dependent)
- I will retry pulling NVDA data and compute the indicators as soon as the data environment is back online.
- Once data is available, I’ll deliver:
  - A detailed, data-driven trend and momentum narrative for NVDA
  - The 8-indicator readings with current values, crossovers, and signal interpretations
  - A concise trading plan (entry, stop, target) if applicable
  - A Markdown summary table of key points (see below)

Markdown table: Key points to monitor (indicator, purpose, actionable takeaway)
| Indicator | Category | Purpose | What to watch for NVDA |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA; slope turning up/down |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price/50SMA relative to 200SMA; golden/death cross cues |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Quick momentum shifts | Price crossing 10EMA; confirm with longer-term trend |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum momentum cross | MACD line crossing above/below zero; cross with MACD signal |
| macds | MACD Related | Smoothing cross verification | MACD vs MACD Signal alignment for entries/exits |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold context | RSI >70 or <30; watch for divergences |
| boll | Volatility Indicators (Middle) | Mean reversion context | Price near/above middle line; breaks with bands for breakout cues |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Risk management and position sizing | Rising ATR suggests larger stops; decreasing ATR means tighter risk controls |

If you’d like me to proceed, I can retry data retrieval now and then provide a full NVDA report with the latest indicator values and a concrete trading view based on the eight indicators above. Please confirm whether to retry immediately or adjust the indicator set or date range.
