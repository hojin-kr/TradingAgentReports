Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock data for SPY on 2025-10-07, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (the get_reddit_stock_info function isn’t currently responding). Because of that, I can’t pull the day-by-day social sentiment from Reddit right now.

Here are the options I can offer to keep moving forward, along with a plan for delivering a thorough SPY analysis:

What happened
- Tool issue: get_reddit_stock_info returned FileNotFoundError. It looks like the underlying data source or path isn’t available at the moment.
- Result: I don’t have the Reddit sentiment data for SPY for the requested date to include in the report.

Options to proceed
1) Retry now
- I can attempt to re-run the Reddit data fetch for SPY on 2025-10-07 in case the issue is transient.

2) Use alternate sources (if you approve)
- I can craft the analysis using other available inputs, such as:
  - Public news headlines and article sentiment (macro context, SPY-related sector moves, earnings, Fed policy signals).
  - General social sentiment from other platforms (if you have access or API keys I can use).
  - Historical context and macro drivers affecting SPY (rates expectations, inflation data, geopolitical events, earnings season). Note: this would be less granular day-by-day sentiment without the Reddit data.

3) Proceed with a high-level, data-limited analysis now
- I can deliver a comprehensive SPY report focusing on:
  - Macro backdrop and catalysts over the past week.
  - What SPY is signaling via price action, volume, and typical ETF drivers.
  - Sector and factor insights (which sectors led/trailed, correlation to tech/financials/energy, etc.).
  - Trading implications, risk factors, and possible scenarios for traders.
- I’ll clearly annotate where sentiment data is missing and what it would add.

What I’ll deliver (if you choose option 3 or 1 with a fallback)
- A long-form, trader-oriented report analyzing SPY’s current state after reviewing social signals and recent news.
- Detailed sentiment interpretation (with day-by-day granularity if available; otherwise, aggregated weekly view).
- News recap (key headlines, earnings, macro data releases, policy signals) and their implications for SPY.
- Technicals overview (price trend, support/resistance, volume signals, momentum indicators) and how they align with sentiment.
- Practical takeaways for traders: potential setups, caveats, risk management notes.
- A final Markdown table organizing key points for quick reference.

Proposed next step
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch now (option 1)?
- Or should I proceed with option 3 (data-limited, high-quality analysis focusing on macro, news, and general sentiment) and clearly indicate where sentiment data is missing?

If you’d like me to proceed with option 3 right away, I’ll produce a detailed SPY analysis and include a Markdown table at the end organizing the key points.
