Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch SPY data to compute the indicators, but the data retrieval failed due to a backend FileNotFoundError. I tried repeatedly, but the environment can’t access the required CSV at the moment. I can proceed in two ways:

- Option A: Retry once you’re ready, and I’ll generate a data-driven, detailed trend report with the selected indicators as soon as the data comes through.
- Option B: Proceed with a robust indicator plan now (without the live data yet), so you have a clear framework to use as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

If you’re okay with Option B, I recommend the following 8 indicators (balanced, complementary, no redundancy) for SPY given a broad-market context:

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these are suitable for SPY
- close_50_sma (50-day SMA): Captures medium-term trend and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming trend direction in SPY’s broad-market moves and filtering noisy entries when combined with faster signals.
- close_200_sma (200-day SMA): Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death-cross type signals) and provides strategic context for positions rather than frequent entries.
- close_10_ema (10-day EMA): A responsive short-term momentum indicator to spot quick shifts and potential entry points. Good to pair with the longer SMAs to avoid false signals in choppy markets.
- macd (MACD line): Momentum gauge; crossovers indicate potential trend changes. Useful in identifying shifting momentum in SPY’s daily/weekly timeframes.
- macds (MACD Signal): Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line help trigger signals with reduced noise.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum/relative strength indicator; 30/70 thresholds help flag oversold/overbought conditions and potential reversals, with divergence checks adding nuance in trends.
- boll (Bollinger Middle): The 20-period SMA that underpins the Bollinger Bands; provides a dynamic baseline for price action and helps assess breakout or reversal likelihood in relation to volatility bands.
- atr (ATR): Measures volatility; essential for risk management: sizing positions and placing stops adaptively to current volatility levels.

How I’ll interpret signals once data is available
- Trend confirmation: Use crossovers/alignments of close_50_sma and close_200_sma with price. If price stays above both and 50SMA above 200SMA, look for buys on pullbacks in uptrends; opposite for downtrends.
- Momentum triggers: MACD and MACD Signal crossovers provide entry/exit timing cues. Confirm with RSI (not overbought/oversold extremes without trend alignment) to reduce false positives.
- Short-term timing: close_10_ema crossovers with price can hint at near-term entries; use with MACD and RSI to avoid noise in sideways markets.
- Volatility-aware risk: ATR informs stop placement and position sizing; Boll middle offers a price-baseline reference; price breaking above/below the Bollinger middle and bands can suggest breakout or reversal scenarios when confirmed by MACD/RSI.
- Operational plan: In a trending environment (SPY above major SMAs and MACD positive), favor trend-following entries with pullback-based entries. In range-bound markets, give more weight to RSI divergences and Bollinger band touches with ATR-based stops.

Next steps
- If you want Option A (retry), I’ll fetch SPY data as soon as the backend issue is resolved and produce a full, data-driven, nuanced report with the 8 indicators, including:
  - current status of each indicator
  - trend direction, momentum, volatility assessments
  - potential entry/exit signals with caveats
  - risk management notes and a concise, trader-friendly plan
  - a Markdown table (as requested) summarizing the indicators and their rationale (I’ll include this in the final report)

Would you like me to:
- Retry data retrieval now (hopeful but depends on the backend), or
- Proceed with the plan (Option B) and deliver the detailed qualitative framework now, followed by a data-driven update as soon as data fetch succeeds?

If you’d prefer, I can go ahead with Option B immediately and provide the detailed narrative plus a Markdown table (below) right away.
