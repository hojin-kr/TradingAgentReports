I attempted to fetch the QQQ data and run the chosen indicators, but I’m hitting a backend data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError) from the data service. I can retry, or proceed with a qualitative framework now and then deliver the full, data-backed report once the data fetch succeeds. Please tell me which you prefer. In the meantime, here is the plan and what I’ll deliver once data is available.

What I will analyze (selected indicators)
I’m proposing to use up to 8 indicators that give complementary insights without redundancy. For QQQ (Nasdaq-100 proxy) the following mix provides trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management perspectives:

- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale for these choices
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Provide mid- to long-term trend context and dynamic support/resistance levels. The 200 SMA helps confirm the broader trend backdrop; the 50 SMA offers a medium-term read that reacts faster than the 200 SMA.
- MACD family (macd, macds, macdh): Capture momentum shifts and trend changes through MACD line crossovers, signal line crossovers, and histogram dynamics. This trio gives a robust view of momentum direction and strength.
- RSI (rsi): Measures momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions. Useful for spotting potential reversals or pullbacks when used with trend context (e.g., RSI divergence with price or with price above/below major moving averages).
- Boll (Bollinger Middle): The 20-period simple moving average that forms the base for Bollinger Bands; helps gauge price deviation, breakout potential, and dynamic support/resistance in conjunction with bands.
- ATR (atr): A volatility gauge to calibrate position sizing and stop placement; helps adapt risk management to current market volatility.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report on QQQ that covers:
  - Trend assessment: how price relates to 50/200 SMAs, any crossovers, and implications for trend longevity.
  - Momentum signals: MACD direction, histogram strength, and RSI positioning to gauge potential continuations or reversals.
  - Volatility context: Bollinger-based assessments (price relative to the middle line and bands) plus ATR-driven risk parameters.
  - Potential entry/exit zones: alignment or misalignment of momentum and trend indicators to identify setups with higher probability.
  - Risk management considerations: suggested stop placements using ATR, and how volatility is evolving.
  - Contextual notes: caveats for regime changes (e.g., low-volatility squeezes, macro-driven moves) and how to filter false signals.

Next steps
- Option A: I retry data retrieval immediately and then generate the full 8-indicator report with a detailed, trend-by-trend analysis and a Markdown summary table.
- Option B: If you’d like to proceed now without live data, I can provide a framework-based analysis template and example interpretations you can adapt to the actual numbers once they’re available.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with Option B (framework-based qualitative analysis) in the meantime?

Markdown table: Key indicators and what they will tell us (once data is available)
| Indicator | Role / What it tells us | How to interpret in the QQQ context |
|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50 SMA suggests bullish momentum; a cross below may warn of a pullback; use with 200 SMA for trend confirmation. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200 SMA indicates long-term uptrend; price below signals potential long-term weakness or range; look for golden/death cross signals relative to price. |
| macd | Momentum and trend change signals | MACD line above zero with positive histogram supports uptrend momentum; crossovers with the signal line can signal entry/exit points; divergence with price is a caution flag. |
| macds | MACD signal line dynamics | Crosses with MACD line reinforce momentum shifts; use in conjunction with MACD for trade triggers. |
| macdh | MACD histogram strength | Histogram expansion suggests accelerating momentum; shrinking histogram may warn of slowing momentum or reversal. |
| rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold context | RSI in overbought/oversold zones can signal reversals but should be confirmed with trend/momentum; in strong uptrends RSI can stay extended. |
| boll | Baseline volatility context (middle band) | Price interaction with the middle band indicates trend fidelity; sustained moves away from the middle line often precede band expansion. |
| atr | Volatility and risk management | Rising ATR means higher volatility and larger stop sizes adjustments; use ATR to set stops and position sizing aligned with current risk. |

If you want me to proceed with retrying the data fetch now, say “Retry now” and I’ll attempt another data pull and then generate the full, detailed eight-indicator report for QQQ.
