Sorry about the hiccup. I tried to fetch META Reddit/news data for 2025-10-07 using get_reddit_stock_info, but the service returned a FileNotFoundError twice. It looks like a backend data path issue on the tool side. I can retry later, or switch to an alternative approach if you’d like.

What I can do right now (options)
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data pull in a few minutes if you want me to wait and try again.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, data-light analysis using other public signals (e.g., press releases, official META announcements, general social-media sentiment I can summarize from known patterns). I won’t have the same granularity as Reddit-specific post-level sentiment, but I can still deliver a robust narrative and framework.
- Option C: If you have a dataset (e.g., a CSV of Reddit posts or other social posts) you can share, I’ll analyze that directly and produce the full report.
- Option D: You can provide access to another sentiment feed you trust, and I’ll alternate to that source.

What I can deliver once I have data (structure you’ll get)
- A comprehensive long-form report detailing META’s current state based on social media sentiment, recent company news, and implied trading implications.
- Day-by-day sentiment trends (if available) with granular insights for traders: catalysts, risk flags, and potential behavior shifts around key events (earnings, product launches, regulatory news, ad demand signals, etc.).
- A synthesized set of actionable takeaways for traders (short, medium, and potential longer-term implications).
- A final Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, drivers, and implications.

If you’d like, I can start with a high-quality, best-effort qualitative analysis of META using available public signals up to today, clearly stating that it’s not pulling live Reddit data. This can give you a head start while we resolve the data retrieval issue.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry now (Option A)
- Proceed with Option B (non-Reddit signals)
- Upload/share a dataset (Option C)
- Use an alternative data source (Option D)

Note: I’ll incorporate the Reddit/news feed as soon as the tool is functioning again, and I’ll append a detailed Markdown table with the key points at the end of the final report.
