I attempted to fetch META's latest fundamental data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) but all calls returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data service is temporarily unavailable or misconfigured on my end. I can retry now or wait a bit and try again, or proceed with a fallback plan if you’d like.

What I can do next (options):
- Retry now: I’ll attempt the same data pulls again and, if successful, assemble the full report.
- Retry on a delay: I can reattempt in a few minutes to see if the service comes back.
- Alternative approach: provide a high-level fundamental framework for META using publicly known information up to the current date, with placeholders indicating where data would be placed once retrieved.
- Narrow focus: fetch only one or two data points you care about (e.g., insider sentiment and income statement) if partial data is acceptable.

If you’d like me to proceed with retries, I’ll run the full set of tools again as soon as the service is available and then deliver a comprehensive, trader-focused fundamentals report. In the meantime, here’s the structure I will deliver once data is in:

Proposed content of the comprehensive report
