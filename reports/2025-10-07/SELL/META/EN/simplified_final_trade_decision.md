# Investment Report: META
## Executive Summary
Near-term risks from AI spending and regulatory costs weigh on margins. Ad-market weakness and a high price relative to earnings raise downside risk. The longer-term AI monetization could help, but not quickly enough to justify current valuations.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Sell META now with high confidence.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term ad market weakness reduces revenue growth and ongoing regulatory costs create recurring expenses that weigh margins.
- AI-related spending may pressure margins in the near term and delay meaningful margin expansion.
- The stock trades at a high price relative to earnings, leaving less room if growth slows or execution falters; competition could erode pricing power.
- While AI monetization offers long-term upside, it is not guaranteed to materialize quickly enough to justify current valuation.
- If growth slows or policy risk stays elevated, multiple compression could push the stock lower.

## Risks To Watch
- AI monetization timeline is uncertain; a slower-than-expected ramp could hit profits.
- Regulatory costs and potential settlements may persist or rise, adding ongoing drag.
- Ad-market dynamics could worsen or recover unpredictably, impacting ARPU.
- Valuation risk: very high price relative to earnings could lead to bigger losses if growth fades.
- Competitive pressure and pricing power erosion could hurt margins.
