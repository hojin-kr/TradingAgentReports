Short answer: SELL META (heavy trim) now.

Rationale (high-level)
- Near-term risks dominate: AI capital expenditure drag on margins, ongoing regulatory exposure and potential cost strains, and cyclicality in ad spend can pressure earnings before any visible monetization uplift.
- Valuation risk: Even with a compelling long-term AI thesis, multiple compression is plausible if near-term growth signals disappoint or policy headwinds persist.
- Positioning context: While the plan notes constructive technicals, the bear case emphasizes real, tangible headwinds that can drive downside in the 6–12 month window. The risk-reward favors risk management given the uncertainty around monetization speed and regulatory relief.

Actionable plan
- If currently overweight META: trim 40–60% of the position now to reduce beta and preserve capital. If your risk tolerance is lower, consider a steeper trim.
- If neutral: implement a hedge rather than a full long exposure. Consider hedges that protect against a downside move while preserving optionality for a re-entry.
- If you must keep some exposure: maintain a very small core position (roughly 0.5–1% of portfolio) with explicit risk controls and tight stop rules.

Hedging and risk controls
- Use downside protection: buy puts near current levels with a 1–2 month horizon (at- or slightly out-of-the-money) or employ a bear put spread to cap cost.
- Position sizing via ATR-based logic: set stops at 1.5x–2x the recent ATR or beneath a key support level like the 200SMA, whichever provides clearer protection.
- Monitor catalysts: regulatory developments (EU DMA milestones, Nigeria settlements), ARPU/tier monetization signals, and regional ad-market trends. Any sustained ARPU growth or meaningful cost relief could prompt a reassessment.

Catalysts and monitoring cadence
- Track EU DMA progress, Nigeria settlements, cross-border data policies.
- Watch ad-market dynamics: CPM trends, advertiser confidence, region-by-region spend.
- Watch monetization signals: ARPU growth by region, AI-driven monetization milestones, cost structure improvements.
- Review cadence: 4–8 weeks to decide on partial re-entry if data shows margin inflection or monetization momentum. Be prepared to further trim or exit if catalysts misfire.

Re-entry considerations (if data improves)
- A cautious re-entry would be contingent on clear, measurable momentum: sustained ARPU acceleration, margin inflection signals, and meaningful regulatory cost relief.
- Re-entry should be incremental and data-driven rather than a full bounce back to prior weights.

Operational note
- If reliable data stabilizes, I’ll adjust the stance promptly to reflect verifiable monetization momentum or regulatory clarity.
