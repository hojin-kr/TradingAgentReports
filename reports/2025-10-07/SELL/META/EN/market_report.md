I attempted to fetch META data (2024-01-01 to 2025-10-07) from the Yahoo Finance feed, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like an environment/tool issue on my end. I can retry the fetch now, or we can proceed with a qualitative baseline while I retry in the background. How would you like to proceed?

In the meantime, I’ve prepared a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for META’s typical market environment (large-cap tech with growth/AI catalysts, periods of expansion and pullbacks, and notable event-driven moves). The selected indicators aim to balance trend, momentum, volatility, and structural levels, without redundancy.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale for each indicator
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average): Captures the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. For META, a sustained price move above the 50SMA often aligns with a constructive mid-term rhythm, while a break below can signal a shift to consolidation or a pullback.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average): Provides the long-term trend context. A price above the 200SMA generally reinforces a bullish backdrop; crossovers (e.g., golden cross with the 50SMA) can mark longer-term bullish momentum, while a death cross can warn of structural weakness.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average): A responsive short-term momentum gauge. Useful for capturing quick shifts around earnings announcements, product news, or macro drivers that affect META's near-term trajectory. Can help with timely entries/exits when used with longer-term averages.
- macd (MACD line): Momentum indicator showing the difference between two EMAs. MACD crossovers (MACD line crossing above/below the signal) can help confirm momentum shifts in META’s trend, especially when price is moving with or against the dominant trend.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Visualizes momentum strength and its acceleration/deceleration. Positive/expanding histogram supports ongoing momentum; a shrinking or negative histogram warns of waning momentum, even if price remains in a trend.
- rsi (Relative Strength Index): Momentum/overbought-oversold gauge. Helps identify potential reversals or pullbacks when META appears stretched (e.g., RSI approaching 70–75 in uptrends) or oversold (near 30) during pullbacks. Divergences between price and RSI can provide warning signals.
- boll (Bollinger Middle, 20-period SMA): Dynamic baseline for price movement. The degree to which price rides the middle line, or breaks above/below the bands, can indicate breakout potential or mean-reversion tendencies in META’s volatility regimes.
- atr (Average True Range): Measures market volatility. Useful for setting risk controls and position sizing, especially around earnings or major AI event dates that can drive enlarged moves. Higher ATR suggests wider stop distances; lower ATR suggests tighter risk constraints.

What I will deliver after I can fetch the data
- A detailed, nuanced trend report for META, including:
  - Alignment of short-term (10 EMA) vs medium-term (50SMA) vs long-term (200SMA) trends.
  - MACD/MACD-Histogram signals confirming or diverging from price action.
  - RSI context with potential divergence or overbought/oversold levels in the current regime.
  - Bollinger-based observations for breakouts versus mean-reversions around the 20-period middle line.
  - ATR-driven risk management implications for stop placement and position sizing.
- A concise decision-support view with potential signal interpretations (e.g., bullish setup if price above 50SMA and 200SMA with MACD bullish signal and RSI rising toward 60s; caution signals if ATR spikes or RSI hits overbought levels while price struggles near resistance).

Next steps
- Please confirm if you’d like me to retry fetching the data now. I can run the fetch again with the same META symbol and date range (2024-01-01 to 2025-10-07), or adjust the date window if you prefer (e.g., a more recent window like 2024-06-01 to 2025-10-07) to improve reliability.
- If you’d rather proceed immediately with a qualitative baseline while I retry, I can provide a hypothetical trend narrative and signal framework based on typical META behavior in recent cycles, clearly labeled as extrapolative until data is retrieved.

Appendix: quick reference table (indicator roles)
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for META | Trade-signal considerations (context) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Price above suggests uptrend; below suggests weakness | Use with price cross and other signals to time entries/exits |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend; major trend benchmark | Price above reinforces bullish context; cross-down may warn | Watch for golden/death cross with 50SMA for strategic bias |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts in momentum; helps catch entries around catalysts | Use with longer averages to filter noise |
| macd | Momentum trend strength | Positive cross indicates bullish momentum; negative cross bearish | Confirm with price action and volatility filters |
| macdh | Momentum acceleration | Expanding positive histogram means strengthening up-move; contracting/negative signals weakness | Helpful to gauge momentum durability |
| rsi | Momentum/overbought-oversold | Overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) signals; divergence clues possible | Use with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends |
| boll | Middle band baseline (20 SMA) for volatility framing | Price relative to middle band and band width informs breakout vs mean-reversion | Observe breaks above/below bands for breakout setups or pullbacks |
| atr | Market volatility | Higher ATR = bigger expected moves; adjust risk/stop levels accordingly | Use to size positions and place stops with volatility awareness |

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed: retry the data fetch now, adjust the date window, or proceed with the qualitative baseline while I attempt another fetch.
