I’m seeing an internal tool error fetching Reddit data for AAPL on 2025-10-07. The get_reddit_stock_info tool returns a FileNotFoundError, which isn’t caused by you. I can’t retrieve Reddit data right now, but I can proceed with a best-effort report using other available sources and clearly annotate the data gap.

Options (choose one):
- Option A: Proceed now with a comprehensive report excluding Reddit data, focusing on recent news, public sentimentExternal sources you’re comfortable with, and a structured analysis of potential trading implications. I’ll clearly label the data gap from Reddit and provide a template table at the end.
- Option B: Wait and retry the Reddit data pull in a few minutes (I can automatically retry if you’d like me to poll for availability and then continue with the full data set once it’s up).

What I’ll deliver if you choose Option A (no Reddit data):
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment tone from recent non-Reddit sources, notable news catalysts (product updates, earnings, regulatory, macro factors) over the past week.
- Daily sentiment overview (non-Reddit): synthesized sentiment trends from available public sources (e.g., major news outlets, official Apple announcements, widely-read financial media) with approximate daily tone and key drivers.
- News catalysts: a digest of the week’s headlines affecting AAPL (positive/neutral/negative) and potential forward impact.
- Price and technical reaction: any observed price moves around news events, implied volatility cues, and notable options activity if available.
- Thematic insights: recurring themes (AI/AR/Device lineup/speculation, supply chain, guidance) and their potential implications for sentiment and risk.
- Risk and caveats: data gaps, potential biases, and considerations for different trading horizons (risk-on vs. risk-off).
- Trading implications: high-signal scenarios and thresholds to watch (e.g., sentiment shifts, key price levels, event-driven catalysts).
- Appendix: sources and methodology notes.

Proposed Markdown table to include at the end (can be filled with actual data once Reddit data is back):
- Table columns: Day, Source(s), Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative), Key Driver, Price Move (intraday/close), Notable News Catalyst, Confidence/Notes

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to proceed now with Option A, I’ll produce a detailed, publication-ready report with all sections and the final Markdown table, clearly marking the Reddit data gap. If you’d like me to retry after a few minutes, I’ll automatically attempt again and then finalize the full report once the data is available.
