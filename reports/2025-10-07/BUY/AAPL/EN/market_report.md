I tried to pull AAPL data, but the data fetch failed due to a backend file access issue (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data fetch now, or you can authorize me to retry in the background. In the meantime, here is a focused, non-data-dependent plan: I’ve selected a core set of 8 complementary indicators that will give a well-rounded view once the data is available. I’ll run these indicators as soon as the data retrieval succeeds and then produce a detailed, nuanced report with concrete observations.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll

Why these indicators
- close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average): Provides the medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. When price is above 50SMA and the slope is rising, it supports a bullish bias; dips toward it can offer potential pullback entries. It helps filter noise from faster signals.
- close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average): Establishes the long-term trend benchmark. A price above 200SMA generally aligns with a longer-term uptrend, while below suggests risk of a long-term bearish bias. Look for confluence with other signals (e.g., MACD, RSI) around the 200SMA.
- close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average): A responsive short-term momentum gauge. Price crossing above/below the 10EMA can signal quick shifts in near-term momentum, useful for timing entries when combined with the longer-term MA framework.
- macd (MACD line): Tracks momentum by comparing two EMAs. Crosses of the MACD line through the zero level and movements away from zero help identify shifts in momentum direction, especially when aligned with price action and other filters.
- macds (MACD Signal): The smoothing of MACD. Crossovers of MACD with its signal line tend to provide more reliable entry/exit signals when corroborated by other indicators.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Visualizes momentum strength and changes. Increasing histogram bars indicate strengthening momentum; negative bars suggest waning momentum. Divergence between MACD/Histo and price can precede reversals.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum oscillator used to flag overbought/oversold conditions (commonly thresholds 70/30) and potential divergences. In uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; in downtrends, it can stay oversold. Use RSI in conjunction with trend signals to reduce false positives.
- boll (Bollinger Middle): The 20-period SMA around which the Bollinger Bands are built. It provides a dynamic mean to measure deviations. Price testing the middle line in the context of band widths can help gauge oppportunities for mean-reversion pullbacks or breakouts when used with bands above/below.

How I’ll interpret them together (once data is back):
- Trend confirmation: If price remains above both 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA trending up, bias toward longs; failure signals occur if price dives below these levels or they cross downward.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and MACD Histogram should align with price action (e.g., bullish price moves with MACD crossing up and histogram rising). Divergences between price and MACD/Histo can warn of a potential reversal.
- Entry timing: A bullish setup could be flagged when price is above the 50SMA, MACD confirms momentum, RSI is not in overbought extreme, and price respects the Bollinger middle with a move toward the upper band. A pullback entry might be considered near the 50SMA or 10EMA if momentum remains positive.
- Risk context: ATR can be used for stop placement and position sizing (not in the current 8-indicator set, but I can add it if you want). The RSI adds a check against overextended moves; but in strong uptrends RSI can stay high for a while, so rely on trend filters first.

Next steps
- I’ll retry fetching the data for AAPL (2024-10-07 to 2025-10-07 or your preferred window) and then compute the 8 indicators above.
- I’ll deliver a detailed, granular trends report, including:
  - Signal alignments (which indicators agree on the trend and where they diverge)
  - Potential entry/exit zones with rationale
  - Risk considerations and suggested stop placement framework
  - A compact summary table of key observations

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now with the same date range, or would you prefer a shorter/alternative window (e.g., last 12 months) to increase the likelihood of data availability?

Appendix: quick reference table of the 8 indicators and their roles
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Category: Moving Averages | Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; filters entries with longer-term trend.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Category: Moving Averages | Role: Long-term trend backbone; confirms alignment with price action and signals longer-term bias.
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Category: Moving Averages | Role: Short-term momentum; timing for quick moves, helps detect rapid shifts.
- Indicator: macd | Category: MACD Related | Role: Momentum direction; crossovers signal trend changes.
- Indicator: macds | Category: MACD Related | Role: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD refine entry/exit signals.
- Indicator: macdh | Category: MACD Related | Role: Momentum strength; histogram dynamics and divergences add nuance.
- Indicator: rsi | Category: Momentum Indicators | Role: Overbought/oversold cues and divergences to anticipate reversals.
- Indicator: boll | Category: Volatility Indicators | Role: Bollinger middle (20SMA); baseline for mean reversion and breakout context.

Table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | Category | What it measures / role | How it helps in decision-making |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Confirms trend direction and filters entries; price above suggests bullish bias |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Determines long-term bias; helps assess sustainability of moves (golden/death cross context) |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Signals near-term momentum shifts; useful for timing in conjunction with longer-term trend |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMA differences | Crossovers/zero-line moves indicate trend changes; used with other filters to reduce noise |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal (smoothing) | Crossovers with MACD refine entries; supports/filters MACD signals |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength | Histogram momentum; divergence cues can pre-empt reversals |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum and overbought/oversold | Thresholds and divergences help gauge reversals in context of trend |
| boll | Volatility Indicators | Bollinger Middle (20SMA) | Baseline for mean reversion vs. breakout context; bands corroborate breakout or pullback signals |

I’ll proceed with data retrieval as soon as possible and then deliver the full, detailed trend report for AAPL. If you want me to retry immediately, say “Retry data fetch for AAPL.”
