Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch data for AMD to generate the indicators, but encountered a system error (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data sources. I can retry data retrieval, but in the meantime I’ve prepared a focused, non-redundant set of indicators (up to 8) and a nuanced framework to analyze AMD given current market context. Once the data fetch succeeds, I’ll attach a data-backed trend report and update signals accordingly.

Recommended indicator suite (AMD)
- close_50_sma
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s useful for AMD: AMD’s momentum often plays out in 1–3 month horizons as AI/data center cycles and gaming demand shift; the 50-day helps filter noise relative to the long-term trend.
- close_200_sma
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation; golden/death cross context.
  - Why it’s useful for AMD: Provides a macro backdrop to AMD’s multi-quarter cycles tied to data center + consumer GPU demand; helps distinguish corrective moves from trend changes.
- close_10_ema
  - Role: Responsive short-term momentum indicator; early entry/exit signals.
  - Why it’s useful for AMD: In volatile periods (e.g., AI cycle news, supply/demand news), the 10 EMA can capture quick shifts that longer averages miss, aiding timely entries if aligned with price action.
- macd
  - Role: Momentum assessment via MACD line vs. signal line, potential crossovers.
  - Why it’s useful for AMD: Helps identify shifts in momentum around earnings, product launches, and AI-driven sentiment. Works best when corroborated with price action and other indicators.
- macds
  - Role: MACD signal line component; crossovers with MACD itself trigger signals.
  - Why it’s useful for AMD: Adds an extra layer to momentum confirmation; reduces false positives from MACD alone in choppy markets.
- macdh
  - Role: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence visualization.
  - Why it’s useful for AMD: Divergence between price and MACD histogram can flag weakening of a move before price reverses, useful around major catalyst events.
- rsi
  - Role: Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold and potential reversals.
  - Why it’s useful for AMD: In strong uptrends or downtrends, RSI can stay extended; use with trend context to avoid false reversals. RSI divergences can help spot looming pullbacks during AI/data-center cycles.
- boll
  - Role: Bollinger middle (20sma) as a volatility-aware baseline; base for breakout/reversion analysis.
  - Why it’s useful for AMD: When price hugs or crosses the middle band, it can indicate continuation or mean-reversion in the short to mid-term, especially around earnings/AI product cadence.

Notes on why this set is complementary
- Combines trend (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA) with momentum (MACD family, RSI) and volatility context (Boll middle). This avoids redundancy (e.g., mixing RSI with Stoch RSI) and covers both directional conviction and potential reversal signals.
- Using MACD family together with RSI helps filter signals in AMD’s often volatile environment driven by catalysts (earnings, AI cycles, supply/demand shifts).
- Boll middle adds a volatility-aware frame that helps interpret whether price moves are within normal ranges or pushing into breakout/mean-reversion territory.

Key considerations for AMD-specific context (as of the general market environment around 2025)
- Catalysts to watch: AI GPU demand trajectory, data center capex cycles, gaming GPU refresh cadence, and supply/demand dynamics (including competition with peers).
- volatility regime: semiconductor stocks can swing on earnings news, guidance revisions, or major product announcements; Boll middle helps gauge whether price is extending beyond typical ranges.
- trend alignment: favorable long-term trend (above 200 SMA) paired with rising momentum (MACD positive, MACD histogram expanding, RSI not dangerously overbought) is a more robust environment for entries.
- risk management: because AMD can exhibit sharp moves, pair signals with ATR-based stop considerations and appropriate position sizing.

Next steps
- I’ll retry data retrieval as soon as the data source is available and generate a live trend report with the actual indicator values, crossovers, divergences, and a structured set of buy/hold/sell ideas based on the eight-indicator framework.
- If you’d like, I can also adjust the look-back window (e.g., extend to 30 days for short-term vs. 60–90 days for longer-term insights) or swap in boll_ub/boll_lb for more explicit breakout/mean-reversion signals.

Key points at a glance (table)
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Role: Medium-term trend | What to watch: Price versus 50 SMA; pullbacks to 50 SMA as potential support; cross above/below for momentum confirmation.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Role: Long-term trend benchmark | What to watch: Price above/below 200 SMA; golden/death cross signals with 50/10 era for strategic direction.
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Role: Short-term momentum | What to watch: Price crossing above/below 10 EMA; use with broader trend to reduce noise.
- Indicator: macd | Role: Momentum crossovers | What to watch: MACD line crossing the signal line; corroborate with price action and other indicators.
- Indicator: macds | Role: MACD signal component | What to watch: Crossovers with MACD line; momentum confirmation or fade signals.
- Indicator: macdh | Role: MACD histogram | What to watch: Histogram expansion/contraction; potential divergences with price.
- Indicator: rsi | Role: Momentum strength & reversal signals | What to watch: Overbought/oversold thresholds (e.g., 70/30) and divergences with price.
- Indicator: boll | Role: Volatility baseline (Middle Band) | What to watch: Price hugging or crossing the middle band; interpret with bands for breakout/mean-reversion cues.

Table: Quick reference for decision logic
- Indicator | Role | Signal to watch | AMD-specific interpretation
- close_50_sma | Trend | Price crossing/holding above 50 SMA | Confirm sustained move when above 50 SMA; watch for pullbacks to 50 SMA as support
- close_200_sma | Trend | Price above/below 200 SMA; cross with 50 SMA | Above 200 SMA favors bullish stance; death cross with 50/200 could signal risk
- close_10_ema | Momentum | Price cross above/below 10 EMA | Use as early entry/exit cue in conjunction with longer-term trend
- macd | Momentum | MACD line vs. signal line cross | Positive cross with price strength supports long entries; negative cross suggests caution
- macds | Momentum | Signal line interactions | Reinforces MACD cross signals; check for convergence/divergence
- macdh | Momentum | Histogram changes | Increasing histogram supports trend, decreasing suggests weakening momentum
- rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold levels; divergences | In uptrends, watch for hidden weaknesses; in downtrends, oversold levels may signal a bounce
- boll | Volatility | Price-to-middle band behavior | Breakouts from Boll middle with volume can indicate sustained moves; use with other signals

If you want me to proceed, I can retry the data fetch now and generate a full, data-backed trend report for AMD using these indicators. Please confirm, and I’ll run the data retrieval again and deliver a detailed, signal-driven analysis.
