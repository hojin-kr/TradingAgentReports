# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD has a multi-year AI compute plan anchored by OpenAI, plus diversified AI demand and a software moat. A staged, milestone-driven buy offers upside with discipline.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Buy with high confidence. Use milestone-driven risk controls and staged exposure to limit downside.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Durable AI revenue visibility: OpenAI tailwind supports a multi-year ramp starting around 2026, extended by broader AI demand.
- Diversified demand reduces single-client risk: Revenue growth from hyperscalers, cloud providers, and enterprise AI helps protect upside.
- Defensible moat through stack and software: AMDâ€™s integrated CPU/GPU mix and ROCm ecosystem can win share even with Nvidia, and software tools support long-run value.
- Margin and earnings potential: Data-center product mix and software/services may lift gross margins over time.
- Risk-managed path: Staged exposure with clear milestones and governance reduces concentration and execution risks.

## Risks To Watch
- OpenAI concentration and governance/dilution risk: Dependence on a single high-profile partner could create headwinds if terms change.
- Execution risk on multi-GW ramp: Large, complex buildouts carry schedule and cost risks; milestones must deliver.
- Margin and policy headwinds: Energy costs, data-center margins, and regulatory developments could pressure profitability.
- Competitive and macro risks: Nvidia leadership and broader AI cycle shifts, plus macro factors affecting AI spending, can impact upside.
- Milestone reliability: If key milestones falter (ramp pace, diversification, or margin improvement), the outlook could deteriorate.
