Decision: BUY

Recommendation: Buy AMD, but only with strict, milestone-driven risk controls and staged exposure.

Executive summary of the debate
- Risky (bull case): AMD has a durable AI compute growth trajectory driven by OpenAI and broader AI demand; a diversified base (hyperscalers, cloud, enterprise AI) plus ROCm/software moat supports multi-year upside. The OpenAI equity angle adds optionality without being a pure “headline” bet.
- Safe/Conservative: OpenAI is a concentration risk with governance/dilution concerns; execution risk on a multi-GW ramp; margin and energy/policy headwinds could erode upside. Requires conservative sizing, risk gates, and hedges.
- Neutral: A balanced view acknowledging OpenAI tailwind and diversification, but arguing for staged exposure and robust risk controls, not a big upfront swing.

Direct quotes and how they inform the decision
- From Risky (bullish case and guardrails):
  - “The OpenAI deal is not merely a single contract; it’s a multi-year spine for a multi-generation AMD AI compute ramp totaling up to 6 GW, with a phased path starting 1 GW in 2026.”
  - “Milestones (e.g., 1 GW ramp in 2026, progress toward 6 GW, warrant terms, diversified AI demand) are essential guardrails.”
  - Counterargument to risks: even if OpenAI is a meaningful tailwind, diversification weakens single-client risk and opens software/moat advantages.
- From Safe (risk-guarded, risk-off lens):
  - “OpenAI dependence is not a clean, multi-year spine worth assuming without dovetailing risks.”
  - “Execution risk around a multi-GW buildout… margin trajectory and energy/policy headwinds” are real threats.
  - “Lower initial exposure and use hedges; staged entry and quarterly de-risking.” 
- From Neutral (balanced)
  - “Durability of the OpenAI tailwind is meaningful if milestones stay on track.”
  - “Eight-indicator framework is useful, but data lag can cause mis-timed entries; staging helps.”
  - “OpenAI governance/dilution risk should be modeled and priced into risk budgets.”

Rationale for Buy (why the consensus supports an actionable long, with discipline)
- Upside is asymmetric and multi-faceted:
  - Durable revenue visibility from a multi-year AI compute ramp that starts in 2026 and broadens beyond OpenAI.
  - Diversified AI demand (hyperscalers, cloud providers, enterprise AI) reduces single-client risk and supports margin upside via software/tools ecosystem (ROCm, services).
  - AMD’s integrated CPU/GPU stack and ROCm ecosystem create a defensible moat that can capture share even with Nvidia as a software ecosystem leader.
- But the upside must be disciplined:
  - The Safe view correctly flags concentration risk, execution risk, and potential margin/energy headwinds.
  - The Neutral view supports a staged approach, anchored to data signals and milestone progress.

Intra-round plan: how to implement a Buy with risk discipline (refined to be practical)
1) Position sizing and entry sequencing
- Initial exposure: 0.75% to 1.25% of the AI/semis sleeve (cap total AMD exposure at 2%–3% of the sleeve, to avoid overconcentration).
- Entry trigger: only when the eight-indicator framework aligns with a positive longer-term trend (price above 50-day and 200-day SMAs, MACD positive with expanding histogram, RSI constructive, price near or above Bollinger middle with rising volume). If live data are lagging, use staged entry and proxies rather than a headline-driven buy.

2) Milestone governance and triggers
- Core milestones to monitor (and to trigger additional sizing):
  - 1 GW ramp confirmed for 2026.
  - Progress toward the full 6 GW with disciplined cost/margin discipline.
  - Diversified AI demand beyond OpenAI (ROCm momentum, cloud partnerships, new wins).
  - Margin trajectory improvements in data-center products (gross margin trend and mix shifts).
- Do not rely on price action alone; scale-in only after milestone credibility is confirmed.

3) Risk controls and hedging
- Stop loss/trailing stop: initial trailing stop 10%–12% from entry (volatility-adjusted). If momentum is favorable, allow for a trailing stop to tighten above the entry price; adjust with ATR-based sizing.
- Partial exits: reduce exposure if milestones disappoint on any core pillar (ramp pace, diversification, margin).
- Hedging: consider a lightweight downside hedge (protective puts or a collar) to cap downside while preserving upside if milestones progress.

4) Monitoring cadence
- Weekly: milestone progress, ROCm ecosystem momentum, data-center demand signals, macro AI cycle cues.
- Quarterly: review margin trajectory, cost discipline, and any OpenAI warrant/gov governance implications; adjust exposure if risk-reward shifts meaningfully.

5) Scenario planning and actions
- Best case: 6 GW ramp confirms on schedule; diversified AI demand accelerates; margins expand; price action confirms uptrend; increase exposure gradually within guardrails.
- Base case: milestones progress with some friction; maintain current exposure with rebalancing and risk checks.
- Worst case: milestones slip, diversification stalls, or dilution/governance terms complicate upside; promptly de-risk or exit.

6) What to do next (practical steps)
- If live data are available, verify alignment with the eight-indicator framework before entry.
- Set alerts for milestone updates (ramp progress, diversification breadth, warrant terms).
- Predefine exact position size, stop levels, and trailing-stop logic in your trading system.
- Prepare for staged adds: first tranche after initial alignment; second tranche upon credible milestone progress; halt adds if milestones falter.

Bottom line
- The AMD thesis is a credible, multi-year AI compute bet. The OpenAI tailwind, plus diversified AI demand and a software/moat-led growth story, offers meaningful upside if milestones are hit and data-center demand remains robust.
- The prudent path is a staged, risk-controlled Buy: small initial exposure, milestone-driven adds, strict risk controls (stops and hedges), and weekly/drequent milestone monitoring. This approach aims to capture the upside while limiting the downside in case execution, governance terms, or macro dynamics surprise to the downside.

Deliverables (final guidance)
- Recommendation: Buy, but with milestone-driven risk controls and staged exposure.
- Rationale: OpenAI tailwind provides durable revenue visibility; diversification beyond OpenAI reduces single-client risk; AMD’s stack/moat supports long-run margin and share gains; risk controls mitigate execution and macro risks.
- Concrete plan (summary):
  - Start with 0.75%–1.25% of AI/semis sleeve; target 1.5%–2% after milestone confirmation; cap at 2%–3% total.
  - Entry only when the eight-indicator framework confirms and trend is constructive.
  - Milestones as decision gates: 1 GW ramp in 2026; progress toward 6 GW; diversified AI demand; margin trajectory improvements.
  - Stops: 10%–12% trailing for initial tranche; 12%–15% for subsequent tranches.
  Hedging: consider puts or collars to cap downside risk.
  Cadence: weekly milestone reviews; quarterly reassessment.
