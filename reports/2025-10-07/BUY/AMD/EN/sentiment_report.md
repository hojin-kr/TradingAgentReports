Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AMD Reddit stock news for 2025-10-07, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError from the backend. It looks like the Reddit data endpoint is temporarily unavailable.

Here are the options to move forward:

- Retry now: I can try the Reddit data fetch again immediately and proceed with the long-form report once it returns data.
- Use alternate sources: I can compile a comprehensive AMD sentiment and news report using public headlines and company news from mainstream outlets and AMD’s own releases. I’ll clearly note that Reddit-sourced sentiment data is unavailable for this pass.
- Hybrid approach: I can draft a detailed AMD report focusing on general sentiment drivers and recent news, and I’ll explicitly flag where Reddit data would have added insight once the tool is back.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, please choose one:
1) Retry Reddit data fetch now
2) Proceed with a Reddit-absent but broad sentiment/news analysis (with a Markdown table at the end)
3) Wait and retry after a short interval

What would you prefer? In the meantime, I can outline what the final report will cover and the structure of the Markdown table so you know what to expect.
