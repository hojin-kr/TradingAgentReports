Analysis summary and decision
- Recommendation: Buy AMD, but with strict, milestone-driven risk controls and a defined exposure cap. Treat this as a high-conviction growth bet on the AI compute cycle, not a single headline play.

Rationale
- Upside framework: OpenAI tailwinds plus a multi-year AI compute cycle support durable revenue visibility beyond one contract.
- Diversified demand: Broader AI workloads and hyperscale AI demand provide a base of CPU/GPU and ROCm software opportunities beyond OpenAI.
- Moat and roadmap: Integrated CPU/GPU stack, software ecosystem, and cloud partnerships help AMD gain share even with Nvidia’s ecosystem.
- Risk disciplines: Milestones are essential guardrails (ramp progress, diversification, warrant terms, margin trajectory). If milestones slip, the risk-reward deteriorates quickly.

Strategic actions (practical steps)
A. Position sizing and entry
- Target allocation: 1.5–3% of the AI/semis sleeve (adjust to your risk tolerance). Avoid overweight exposure to a single narrative.
- Entry trigger: wait for constructive technical signals aligned with the eight-indicator framework (price above 50-day and 200-day moving averages, MACD positive with expanding histogram, RSI constructive, price near or above Bollinger middle with rising volume).

B. Milestone governance and triggers
Monitor and act on:
1) 2026 ramp confirmation: visible evidence of 1 GW ramp starting.
2) Progress toward 6 GW: quarterly updates on pace and cost discipline.
3) OpenAI warrants/dilution terms: governance implications and exercise milestones.
4) Diversified AI demand: wins beyond OpenAI (hyperscalers, cloud providers, enterprise AI).
5) Margin trajectory: improving data-center gross margins with favorable mix.

C. Risk controls and hedges
- Stop loss: trailing stop or a drawdown limit of roughly -12% to -15% from entry (adjust for volatility and size).
- Partial exits: reduce exposure on disappointment in milestone progress or margin deterioration; reallocate to better-supported themes.
- Diversification guardrail: keep AMD within the planned allocation to avoid concentrating risk in an AI/semis slate.

D. Monitoring and data cadence
- Weekly review of: milestone progress, ROCm momentum, data-center demand signals, macro AI cycle indicators.
- Use milestone proxies if live numbers lag; escalate to quantitative triggers when numbers become available.

E. Scenario planning
- Best case: 6 GW ramp confirmed on schedule; diversified AI demand accelerates; margins expand; price action confirms uptrend; increase exposure gradually.
- Base case: Milestones progress with some friction; maintain exposure with periodic rebalancing.
- Worst case: Milestones slip or diversification weakens; warrant terms prove dilutive; cut exposure promptly and reallocate.

F. Operational steps to execute now
- If you have live data: verify alignment with the eight-indicator framework before entry; set alerts for milestone updates; lock in exact position size, stop levels, and trailing-stop logic in your trading system.

G. Execution discipline notes
- Treat as a high-conviction, risk-managed growth bet on AI compute, not a binary OpenAI “slam dunk.”
- Revisit quarterly or sooner if milestone deviations emerge; be ready to adjust exposure quickly.

Final assessment and decision
- Given the plan’s logic, the strongest action is to pursue AMD with disciplined risk controls, accepting that gains depend on milestone progress and diversified AI demand alongside ongoing margin improvement.
