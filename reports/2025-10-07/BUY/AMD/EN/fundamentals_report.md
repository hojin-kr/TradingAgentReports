I attempted to pull the requested AMD fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) for the current date 2025-10-07, but all tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError. Specifically, the following endpoints failed:
- get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment
- get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions
- get_simfin_balance_sheet
- get_simfin_cashflow
- get_simfin_income_stmt

Because the data sources are currently returning errors, I don’t have fresh numbers to report. I can proceed in a few ways:
- Retry now or in a short interval to see if the services come back online.
- Use alternative public filings/data sources to assemble the fundamentals manually (if you’re comfortable with that approach).
- Focus on a qualitative fundamental assessment of AMD (without exact numbers) based on the typical drivers and recent industry context, with placeholders for where numeric data would go.

What I can do right now (qualitative, with a plan for numbers once data is accessible)
- Company profile and business model
  - AMD designs and sells CPUs, GPUs, and APUs primarily for consumer computing, data center, and embedded/enterprise markets.
  - Revenue drivers historically include: client processors (CPUs for desktops/laptops), data center accelerators (servers, AI/ML workloads), semi-custom applications (gaming consoles in some periods), and graphics solutions.
  - Competitive landscape: Nvidia dominates GPUs for AI/ML and high-end graphics, Intel remains a CPU competitor with data center aspirations, and AMD has gained share in both consumer and data center segments over the past few years.
  - Strategic advantage: a strong roadmap in CPU/GPU stack, EPYC/Ryzen analytics for performance-per-watt, and ongoing compute performance gains that appeal to hyperscalers and enterprise buyers.

- Financials (structure you’d typically see)
  - Income statement (quarterly): revenue by segment (Compute/Graphics vs Data Center), gross margin, operating expenses (R&D and SG&A), operating income, interest and taxes, net income.
  - Balance sheet: cash and equivalents, inventory levels, accounts receivable, property, plant & equipment, debt load, and shareholders’ equity.
  - Cash flow: cash flow from operations (operating cash flow), capital expenditures (CapEx), free cash flow, cash flow from financing activities (debt repayments, share repurchases/dividends).
  - Margin and profitability trends: gross margin trend (driven by product mix and manufacturing costs), operating margin (impact of R&D and SG&A), and net margin.

- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (what to look for)
  - Insider sentiment over the past 15 days can indicate management and insiders’ confidence about near-term prospects.
  - Insider transactions reveal whether executives/board members are buying or selling; sustained buys can be a positive signal, while large, ongoing sells may raise questions about confidence or liquidity needs.

- Key risks to monitor (typical for AMD)
  - Demand volatility in PC/mobile cycles affecting client CPU/GPU volumes.
  - AI/Data Center demand and supply dynamics, including competing accelerators and supplier constraints.
  - Supply chain and foundry/capacity constraints that can affect ASPs and margins.
  - Competitive pressure on price/performance and acceptance of new architectures.

- Potential catalysts (typical in the current context)
  - Launch/pilot of next-gen CPUs/GPUs with improved performance-per-watt.
  - Data center deployments with strong AI training/accelerating workloads.
  - Positive developments in partnerships, customer wins, or favorable licensing/fab arrangements.

Next steps I can take immediately
- Attempt another data pull to recover the five data sources (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement).
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a qualitative narrative now and queue numeric data to be filled in as soon as the data sources come back online.
- Alternatively, you can provide any numeric figures you have (or a link) and I’ll build the full report around them, including trend analysis, ratios, and a trader-focused interpretation.

Proposed structure of the comprehensive report (to be filled with actual data once available)
- Executive summary: what the data says about AMD’s fundamentals over the past week.
- Company profile and business model
- Financial statements (latest quarterly/annual)
  - Income statement: revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, key line items.
  - Balance sheet: assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity ratios.
  - Cash flow: operating, investing, financing activities; free cash flow.
- Ratios and trends
  - Profitability: gross margin, operating margin, net margin.
  - Efficiency: ROA, ROE, asset turnover.
  - Liquidity and leverage: current ratio, debt/EBITDA, net debt.
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions
  - Summary of sentiment signals and notable insider moves.
- Competitive and industry context
  - Market share trends, product cycle timing, and AI/data center demand.
- Risks and catalysts
- Trading implications and scenarios
- Appendix: data sources and methodology

Markdown table (formatting to append at the end)
- This table will summarize the key points once data is available. For now, it reflects the current data retrieval status.

| Section | Data Status | Key Observations / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Insider Sentiment | Data unavailable (tool error) | Awaiting retrieval; past 15-day trend to be summarized |
| Insider Transactions | Data unavailable (tool error) | Awaiting retrieval; look for buys vs sells, sizes |
| Balance Sheet ( quarterly ) | Data unavailable (tool error) | Awaiting latest figures for assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity |
| Cash Flow ( quarterly ) | Data unavailable (tool error) | Awaiting latest operating, investing, financing cash flows |
| Income Statement ( quarterly ) | Data unavailable (tool error) | Awaiting revenue, margins, expense line items |
| Company Profile / Business Model | Qualitative overview ready | AMD's CPU/GPU/Data Center mix, competitive positioning |
| Key Risks | Qualitative assessment | PC demand cyclicality, AI/Data Center demand, supply chain, competition |
| Catalysts | Qualitative assessment | Next-gen products, data center wins, AI adoption momentum |
| Trader View / Implications | Pending data | Will synthesize once numbers and sentiment are available |

If you’d like me to proceed now with a qualitative, numbers-free analysis and clearly label all sections as tentative until data comes back, say “Proceed with qualitative analysis.” If you’d prefer I keep trying the data calls and report back as soon as any of the five data sources succeed, I can do that as well.
