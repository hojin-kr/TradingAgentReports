I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock news for GOOGL (2025-10-07), but the tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError). That looks like a temporary tool issue on the backend rather than an issue with the data itself. I can retry shortly, or we can switch to a broader sentiment-and-news approach using other sources if you’d like.

What I can do right now
- Retry the Reddit data pull for GOOGL on 2025-10-07 as soon as the tool is available again.
- If you prefer, shift to a multi-source sentiment pass (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits, mainstream news coverage about Alphabet/Google) plus the latest company announcements from Alphabet, to build a robust sentiment profile over the past 7 days.
- Compile a comprehensive long-form report once data collection succeeds, focusing on:
  - Daily sentiment breakdown and notable shifts (by day)
  - Key topics driving sentiment (AI, antitrust/regulatory, earnings chatter, product launches like Pixel/Cloud, etc.)
  - News flow and its potential price impact (mergers, partnerships, regulatory updates, leadership changes)
  - Comparison of sentiment vs. price/volume action (what days did sentiment spike without price movement, and vice versa)
  - Risk factors and catalysts to watch in the near term
  - Trading implications and potential ideas (short/medium-term)

Proposed deliverable structure (to fill with data once retrieved)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment posture, latest news headlines, and a concise risk/trigger picture.
- Sentiment analytics by day: bullet points or mini-summaries for each day in the past week, with approximate sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative) and any notable threads.
- Topic/drivers analysis: taxonomy of top topics driving sentiment (AI developments, regulatory scrutiny, stock performance catalysts, product announcements).
- News flow synthesis: brief synthesis of the most impactful news items from the past week and their potential market impact.
- Price/volume correlation notes: quick read on whether sentiment led price moves, or price moves drove sentiment.
- Risk factors and catalysts: 3–5 items with timelines where applicable.
- Trading implications: practical takeaways for traders/investors (e.g., ranges to watch, potential entry/exit signals, risk controls).
- Appendices:
  - Data sources and methodology
  - Daily sentiment table (compact)
  - Key headlines list

Markdown table (example template to include at the end)
- This is just a template; I’ll fill it with real data once the data pull succeeds.

Next steps options
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data pull now and then proceed to integrate multi-source sentiment and news data for a full report.
- Option B: I switch immediately to a multi-source sentiment and news approach (without relying on the Reddit tool) and deliver the complete report with a robust cross-source analysis.

How would you like to proceed? If you want me to retry the Reddit fetch, I’ll run it again now and begin building the full report as soon as data comes in.
