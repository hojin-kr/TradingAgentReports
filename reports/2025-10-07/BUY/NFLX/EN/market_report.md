I tried to fetch NFLX data to generate the indicators, but I’m hitting a data-access error (FileNotFoundError) from the data source. It looks like the current session cannot access Yahoo Finance data via the provided tool right now. If you can retry later, switch data sources, or provide a fresh environment, I can pull the actual values and produce a detailed, data-driven readout. In the meantime, here is a solid, complementary 8-indicator setup tailored for NFLX along with how to use it once data is available.

Recommended 8 indicators for NFLX (diverse, non-redundant, up to 8)
- close_50_sma (50-period simple moving average)
  - What it tells you: medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why NFLX: helps confirm the ongoing trend in a volatile growth name and filters noise when used with faster signals.
- close_200_sma (200-period simple moving average)
  - What it tells you: long-term trend context and major support/resistance levels; useful for trend bias (golden/death cross concepts).
  - Why NFLX: provides strategic perspective on how far the stock has progressed in its multi-quarter trend.
- close_10_ema (10-period exponential moving average)
  - What it tells you: short-term momentum and quicker shifts in price action.
  - Why NFLX: captures recent momentum moves around catalysts (earnings, platform changes, content cycles) and can flag early entries/exits when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd (MACD line)
  - What it tells you: momentum and potential trend changes through EMA differences.
  - Why NFLX: helps detect shifts in momentum as growth narrative evolves; useful in tandem with other filters.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it tells you: smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line generate possible entry/exit signals.
  - Why NFLX: adds a confirmation layer to MACD, reducing false positives in choppy markets.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it tells you: momentum strength and divergence relative to price.
  - Why NFLX: can highlight accelerating or waning momentum, especially around earnings or user metrics releases.
- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - What it tells you: overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; also divergence signals.
  - Why NFLX: in a high-velocity growth stock, RSI helps spot fatigue or exhaustion in the move, but should be context-filtered with trend indicators.
- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it tells you: current volatility level; helps size positions and set stop levels.
  - Why NFLX: volatility spikes are common around earnings and subscriber news; ATR provides a framework for risk management rather than just direction.

How to interpret and use once data is available
- Trend filter: if price is above 50SMA and above 200SMA, bias toward bullish trades; if below, bias toward bearish or cautious strategies.
- Momentum confirmation: look for MACD line crossing above/below the MACD signal, with MACD histogram rising in the same direction; ideally aligned with the 10_ema for timely entries.
- Momentum strength: check RSI for overbought/oversold clues, but avoid overreliance in strong trends (RSI can stay extended); use it with MACD and price position relative to MAs.
- Volatility/ risk: use ATR to set stop-loss distances; higher ATR suggests wider stops and potentially larger position sizes only if risk is managed.
- Synthesis: a bullish cue is price above rising 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD above its signal with a rising histogram, RSI not in extreme overbought territory, and ATR indicating manageable volatility. A bearish cue would be the opposite signals, especially if price tests resistance near the 50SMA/200SMA and MACD diverges.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry pulling the data now or after you confirm a data source is accessible (e.g., re-running get_YFin_data or using an alternative data provider).
- If you want immediate analysis even without live data, I can provide a hypothetical interpretation framework (with clearly labeled assumptions) or run backtests if you provide a data snapshot.

Appendix: quick reference table (indicator roles and usage for NFLX)
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for NFLX (trading guidance) |
|---------|----------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Use to confirm trend direction; price above 50SMA supports upside bias when aligned with other signals. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend; major support/resistance | Use for strategic context and to gauge major trend; look for crosses with price for longer-term signals. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum | Use for early entries/exits; confirm against 50SMA/200SMA to filter noise. |
| macd | MACD Line | Momentum; potential trend changes | Look for crossovers and alignment with price trend and RSI; use as a momentum signal. |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD; signal line crossovers | Use in combination with MACD line to trigger trades; reduces false positives when used with other filters. |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence | Use to gauge momentum acceleration or deceleration; watch for divergences with price. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold; momentum reversals | Use with trend context; beware in strong trends where RSI can stay extended. |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility; risk sizing | Use to set stops and position size; higher ATR requires wider stops and/or smaller position sizing. |

If you want me to retry data retrieval now, say the word and I’ll attempt again (and adjust the plan if the data source changes).
