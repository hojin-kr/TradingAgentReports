I’m running into a data-access error right now. The tool calls to Finnhub/SimFin are returning FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch the latest NFLX fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, or income statement) at the moment.

What would you like to do next?

Options
- Retry now: I can try again in a few minutes to see if the data sources come back online and fetch NFLX fundamentals.
- Provide data you already have: If you can paste the outputs (or attach the files) from Finnhub/SimFin for NFLX, I’ll assemble a comprehensive report with detailed analysis and a Markdown table at the end.
- Proceed with a qualitative analysis: I can still deliver a thorough, trader-focused fundamental overview of NFLX that discusses business model, revenue drivers, profitability dynamics, balance sheet health, cash flow profile, and potential catalysts/risks. This won’t include the latest numeric figures, but it will give structured, actionable insights. If you want this route, I’ll clearly label data as “not current due to data-access issue.”

If you’d like, I can also prepare a report outline now (without numbers) so you’re ready to drop in the data as soon as the sources are accessible. Here’s the proposed structure I’ll fill in once data is available:

- Executive summary
- Company profile and business model (Netflix, segments, monetization, content strategy)
- Key financials (latest income statement highlights, cash flow, and balance sheet snapshot)
- Historical financials and trend analysis (revenue growth, gross margin, operating margin, FCF)
- Liquidity and solvency (cash position, debt, coverage ratios)
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days)
- Driver analysis (subscribers, ARPU, churn, content spend, international growth, ad-supported tier impact)
- Risk and catalyst assessment (regulatory, competitive, streaming market dynamics, subscriber fatigue, macro)
- Trader-focused takeaways (implications for valuation, potential mispricings, scenarios)
- Data appendix (sources and dates)
- Markdown table summarizing key points (to be appended)

Please tell me which option you prefer, or share the data you have, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
