# Daily Trading Intelligence: PLTR

## Executive Snapshot
- Palantir rebounded after the Army memo on defense-network security was clarified as non-critical (config issues resolved) and highlighted a healthcare data analytics partnership to diversify beyond defense. Q3 revenue guidance kept in focus: midpoint around $1.085 billion, about **+50% YoY** growth. Near-term volatility remains tied to headlines on security and government contracts, but healthcare/data analytics partnerships add optionality. Street chatter remains constructive (CFRA Buy; Wedbush upside). Trading stance: neutral-to-bullish on dips; look for durable contract momentum before re-accumulating.

## Macro Backdrop
- AI/tech leadership and risk-on/risk-off dynamic shaping high-beta names; Palantir exposed to headline-driven swings around government procurement and defense programs.
- Government spending cycles and defense procurement (NGC2-like programs) remain key drivers; UK and international opportunities cited as potential tailwinds.
- Healthcare analytics expansion (OneMedNet) diversifies revenue and mitigates single-segment exposure, aligning with broader AI/data demand tailwinds.
- Macro data and rate backdrop influence tactical moves in growth/AI equities and can amplify headline-driven volatility.

## Company-Specific Catalysts and News
- Negative Army memo on battlefield-network prototype (NGC2) initially pressured PLTR; subsequent clarification that vulnerabilities were configuration issues mitigates risk narrative.
- Healthcare analytics partnership: OneMedNet selected Palantir to advance healthcare AI and data analytics; broadens real-world data footprint beyond defense.
- Analyst coverage and sentiment: CFRA Buy rating; Wedbush All-Star analyst Daniel Ives signaling continued upside for Palantir’s AI/Data platform.
- UK Digital ID scheme: Palantir not participating; potential regulatory/market implications monitored.
- Revenue/guidance context: Q3 guidance midpoint ~ **$1.085B**, implying roughly **+49–50% YoY** growth; keeps growth expectations high but valuation-sensitive.
- Market action: bounce after clarification; ongoing AI-name leadership dynamics and headlines impacting near-term volatility.

## Price Action and Technical Levels
- Current setup shows a relief/rebound vibe after the clarification, with continued sensitivity to defense/news headlines.
- Price levels to monitor (live data required for precise numbers):
  - **Resistance Level 1 (R1):** near-term pivot at the prior swing high from the recent rally.
  - **Resistance Level 2 (R2):** next hurdle if R1 is cleared, aligned with the prior consolidation/peak window.
  - **Support Level 1 (S1):** near the recent swing low or consolidation floor after the spike.
  - **Support Level 2 (S2):** deeper support if S1 breaks, based on prior consolidation zones.
- Short-term technical posture: leaning constructive with higher-lows visible in the wake of the clarification; watch for follow-through on any contract/milestone news.
- Actionable price targets (relative to current quote):
  - **Base Case target:** +6% to +12% from current level
  - **Bull Case target:** +18% to +28% from current level
  - **Bear Case target:** -8% to -16% from current level
- Risk controls:
  - If price closes below **S1**, reassess longs and consider trimming into rallies.
  - If price breaks above **R1** with conviction, scale into longs toward **R2**.

Note: Exact price levels require live quote input. Use this framework to map intraday to daily actions once the current PLTR price, volume, and IV are available.

## Trading Scenarios and Outlook
- Base Case
  - Narrative: Security environment clarified; healthcare/data analytics partnerships gaining visibility; Q3 guidance intact.
  - Trade: Neutral-to-mildly bullish on pullbacks; add on confirmation of ongoing healthcare deals and sustained contract momentum.
  - targets: **+6% to +12%** from current; key trigger is holding above S1 with thread of gains toward R1/R2.
  - Risk controls: trim on strength into a reset rally; place stop below S1.

- Bull Case
  - Narrative: Healthcare analytics contracts scale; defense program milestones advance; CFRA/Wedbush uplift reinforces multiple expansion.
  - Trade: Build core exposure on dips; opportunistic add on pullbacks that hold S1.
  - targets: **+18% to +28%** from current; if R1 breaks with volume, reassess to target R2.
  - Risk controls: monitor for new defense headlines; tighten stops if headline risk re-emerges.

- Bear Case
  - Narrative: Renewed defense-headline risk or slower-than-expected healthcare contract wins; heightened valuation scrutiny.
  - Trade: Reduce exposure into rallies; avoid chasing into new headlines.
  - targets: **-8% to -16%** from current; look for structural support near S2 before any re-entry.
  - Risk controls: define explicit stop on close below S2; monitor for cadence of contract awards.

Notes on data sources and gaps
- Data pulled from a Finnhub-like feed (some entries empty) and Google News cross-checks; Reddit feed not retrieved in this run. Google News provides the core headline snapshot (defense-security narrative, healthcare partnerships, market sentiment).
- For precise price-action levels, pull live PLTR price, volume, and implied volatility to populate the S1/S2/R1/R2 levels and update the Base/Bull Bear targets in real time.

If you want, I can:
- Pull a tighter price-action map (intraday to daily) around the defense-news window to quantify the bounce.
- Compile a tight catalysts calendar (earnings date, defense contract milestones, healthcare partnership milestones) to optimize timing.
- Build a scenario playbook with precise USD price targets and risk controls once live data is provided.

I can also attach a concise catalyst calendar (earnings, contract awards, and partnership milestones) to tighten timing.
