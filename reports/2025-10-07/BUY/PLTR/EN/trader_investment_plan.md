Recommendation: Buy, with a disciplined, risk-managed entry and ongoing monitoring.

Why this aligns with the plan
- Planted in Palantir’s core moat: governance, data lineage, and trusted multi-cloud deployment create durable switching costs that support multi-year upside.
- Cross-vertical expansion and AI tailwinds: commercial Foundry uptake (healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, international) plus AI-driven demand support a durable ARR growth and margin improvement trajectory.
- Risk-aware stance acknowledged: near-term profitability pressure and valuation risk are real, but the plan emphasizes controlled sizing and proof points (ARR/margin progress) before aggressive scaling.

Concrete entry and position sizing
- Starter allocation: 1-2% of portfolio as a core PLTR starter.
- Scaling plan: if pullbacks occur and momentum confirms, add incrementally up to a total position of 4-6% over 4–6 weeks.

Entry triggers (basics to validate before adding)
- Price is above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and price action shows an uptrend (e.g., price above the 20-/50-day MA convergence zone).
- Momentum confirmations: MACD positive cross, RSI in a constructive range (not overbought; e.g., 40–65 when entering).
- Buy on a pullback test: a shallow retest near the 50-day SMA or a defined support zone with bullish confirmations (volume pickup, bullish candlestick pattern).

Risk controls and exit framework
- Trailing stop: set initially around 10-15% below the entry price, adjusted upward as the position moves in your favor; prefer a price-action trailing method over a fixed % in noisy markets.
- Exit risk if progress stalls: if ARR or gross margins fail to improve for two consecutive quarters, consider trimming 25–50% of the position to preserve capital.
- Do not over-allocate to one name: use PLTR as a core governance/platform exposure within a diversified AI/software basket; hedge modestly if broad tech risk spikes.

Catalysts to monitor
- Near-term: sustained commercial Foundry ARR growth, monetization milestones in healthcare/finance/industrials, and signs of improving software mix and gross margins.
- Risk flags: softer ARR prints, deteriorating margins beyond defined thresholds, or macro/defense budget headwinds that materially affect pipeline timing.

Scenario map (calibrated expectations)
- Base case (plan in motion): PLTR demonstrates steady ARR growth and margin improvement; stock gradually moves higher on accumulated momentum; position scales toward 4–6% with disciplined risk controls.
- Bull case: Accelerated ARR growth, outsized cross-sell wins, and clearer margin expansion lead to a stronger multi-quarter uptrend; consider staged profit-taking or tighter stops to lock gains.
- Bear case: If near-term profitability remains pressured and ARR velocity slows, risk controls should trigger trimming and potential reassessment; maintain a lighter exposure or shift toward higher-quality AI/software peers if warranted.

Bottom line
- Decision: Buy. The risk-reward favors a constructive, patient long exposure to PLTR with disciplined entry sizing, clear triggers, and robust risk controls. Monitor ARR/margin signals closely and let those data points guide incremental additions.
