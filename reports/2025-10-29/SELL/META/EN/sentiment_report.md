I tried to fetch the Reddit stock info for META (2025-10-29) to pull the latest social sentiment and headlines, but the tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I’ve attempted multiple times, and it looks like the data fetch tool is currently down. I can either retry now or proceed with a thorough qualitative analysis using public sentiment and recent news sources without that tool.

If you’d like me to proceed without the automated Reddit feed, here’s what I can deliver next:

What I can do now (without the Reddit tool)
- Provide a comprehensive qualitative analysis of META based on known public sentiment drivers and recent headlines up to today.
- Outline day-by-day sentiment themes and notable news events from the past week, with trader implications.
- Assess how product cycles (e.g., AI initiatives, ads business, metaverse pivots) and regulatory/compliance issues may weigh on sentiment and risk.
- Deliver a structured report with actionable takeaways for traders, including potential scenarios and hedging considerations.

How I’ll structure the report (once data is available or via qualitative synthesis)
- Executive snapshot: current mood in social chatter, notable headlines, and a quick read on sentiment momentum.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: high-level sentiment by day, top themes driving mood (e.g., earnings hints, product launches, policy/regulatory news, competitive moves).
- Key drivers and themes: ad-market dynamics, AI product integration, user growth on core platforms (Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp), Reels/short-video monetization, and any metaverse-related discussion.
- News analysis: summarize the latest press releases, earnings commentary, regulatory updates, and notable media coverage.
- Price-sentiment correlation: discuss any observed (or expected) alignment between sentiment shifts and price action, including potential lag effects.
- Risks and catalysts: regulatory scrutiny, advertiser spend volatility, competition from other platforms, platform policy changes, and macro ad-market cycles.
- Trader implications and scenarios: what bullish, bearish, and base-case outcomes could look like over the next days to weeks; risk management notes and hedging ideas.
- Summary table: a concise, organized table of key points, drivers, and implications.

If you want me to retry now to fetch the Reddit data, say “Retry,” and I’ll kick off another attempt immediately. If you prefer, I’ll proceed with the qualitative analysis right away and deliver a detailed report with a Markdown table at the end.
