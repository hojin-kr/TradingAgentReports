Sorry about that — I hit an internal error when trying to fetch the Reddit-based stock news for PLTR on 2025-10-29. The error indicates a FileNotFoundError from the tool backend. I can retry the fetch, but if the issue persists, I’ll proceed with an alternative approach using other sources (press releases, major news outlets, social sentiment from other platforms) to produce a thorough PLTR sentiment and news report.

Options to proceed:
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then deliver the full long report with the Reddit-derived sentiment and daily breakdown.
- Option B: I proceed immediately with a comprehensive PLTR sentiment and news report using alternative sources (press releases, earnings announcements, government/enterprise contract news, Twitter/X, StockTwits, etc.) and provide a detailed weekly sentiment view and trading implications, with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option C: You specify a date range or choose to focus on a specific subset (e.g., last 5 trading days, last week, or a particular news event window).

If you’d like me to proceed right away, I’ll default to Option B and build a thorough PLTR report with:
- Daily sentiment snapshot (over the past 7 days) from multiple sources (where available), highlighting bullish, bearish, and neutral signals.
- Key sentiment drivers and themes (AI rollout/news, government contracts, competitive landscape, governance/news events, regulatory/regulatory doubt, valuation chatter).
- Notable news items and their potential impact on price action (earnings, guidance, partnerships, product launches, regulatory developments).
- Market context (peer activity, sector sentiment, macro factors affecting tech/data analytics names).
- Trading implications and risk considerations for traders/investors (entry/exit considerations, catalysts to watch, risk notes).
- A concise, readable Markdown table at the end summarizing:
  - Date
  - Source/Signal
  - Sentiment (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral)
  - Key Catalyst
  - Potential Impact
  - Trading Implications

Before I run with Option B (or if you want me to retry Option A), a couple quick clarifications:
- Do you want a 7-day horizon (last 7 trading days) or a different window?
- Should I include options market signals (e.g., implied volatility and notable call/put activity) if available?
- Any preferred sources besides Reddit (e.g., StockTwits, X/Twitter, major outlets, Palantir investor relations)?

If you’d like me to retry the Reddit feed now, say “Retry,” and I’ll attempt again and blend those results into the report.
