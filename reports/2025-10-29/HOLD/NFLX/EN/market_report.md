I’m sorry — I attempted to fetch NFLX data from Yahoo Finance via YFin, but the environment returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the CSV/data source path isn’t available right now, not something about NFLX itself. I can try again, or proceed with a plan using the indicators I would run once data is accessible. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:

Options
- Retry data retrieval now (I’ll attempt to fetch NFLX data again for a fresh window).
- Retry with a shorter window or a different date range (e.g., 2025-01-01 to 2025-10-29) to see if the system can produce a dataset.
- Proceed with a detailed indicator plan and a structured trading framework, so we’re ready to generate the full trend report as soon as data is available.

In the meantime, here are the 8 indicators I would select for NFLX to provide complementary, non-redundant insights. This set covers trend, momentum, volatility, and volume, and avoids overlap.

Selected indicators (up to 8)
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages) — Long-term trend benchmark; confirms overall direction and potential support/resistance.
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages) — Medium-term trend direction; helps filter signals from faster oscillators.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages) — Short-term momentum; provides quicker read on shifts when used with longer MA filters.
- macd (MACD) — Momentum signal via EMA differences; good for trend-change signals in conjunction with other filters.
- macds (MACD Signal) — Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD add a confirmatory signal layer.
- macdh (MACD Histogram) — Momentum strength and divergence indication; helpful for spotting early momentum shifts.
- rsi (RSI) — Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold levels; useful for potential reversals when aligned with trend.
- vwma (VWMA) — Volume-weighted trend confirmation; blends price action with volume for validation of moves.

Rationale for this mix
- Trend backbone: 200 SMA and 50 SMA establish structural direction and potential support/resistance zones, reducing whipsaw risk in spots where NFLX experiences volatility.
- Momentum granularity: MACD family (macd, macds, macdh) provides multiple layers of momentum signals (line crossovers, smoothing, and histogram strength) to corroborate entries/exits.
- Quick momentum and overextensions: RSI adds a momentum counterbalance to the MACD signals, helping identify overbought/oversold conditions that may precede reversals in the context of the prevailing trend.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA injects a volume perspective, which is particularly helpful for a stock like NFLX where volume spikes (earnings, subscriber news) can precede or confirm price moves.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced trend report for NFLX, including:
  - Current trend assessment using the 200 SMA, 50 SMA, and 10 EMA.
  - MACD alignment with macd/macds/macdh signals and any divergences.
  - RSI positioning relative to trend and potential reversal signals.
  - VWMA-based confirmation of price moves with volume.
  - Contextual interpretation around recent price action, earnings cadence, and fundamental catalysts.
  - Risk-aware trading implications (entry/exit ideas, stop loss considerations using ATR for context, and position sizing notes).

Markdown table: Key indicators and roles
- I will append this table in the final, detailed report once data is loaded. Here is the structure I will use:

| Indicator | Category | What it measures | Why it’s relevant for NFLX (context) |
|-----------|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Helps confirm whether NFLX is in a broader uptrend or downtrend across multi-quarter horizons. |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction | Filters noise from short-term swings; supports trend-confirmation with 200 SMA. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Captures quick shifts; useful for early entry/exit signals when aligned with longer MAs. |
| macd | MACD | Momentum via EMA differences | Signals potential trend changes; works best with trend filters. |
| macds | MACD Signal | Signal line; smoother momentum signal | Provides confirmation of macd crossovers. |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength/divergence | Early indicator of acceleration/deceleration in price moves. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold conditions | Helps identify potential reversals within the prevailing trend. |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Price action filtered by volume | Validates moves with volume, important around catalysts (earnings, platform news). |

Next steps
- Tell me how you’d like to proceed: retry data fetch now, retry with a different window, or proceed with the indicator plan
- I’ll generate NFLX’s full, detailed trend report and the final Markdown table as soon as I have the data

Again, I apologize for the hiccup. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll move forward right away.
