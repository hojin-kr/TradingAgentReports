# Investment Report: NFLX
## Executive Summary
Netflix has potential upside from ads, international ARPU, and gaming/IP, but near-term margin pressure creates risk. Hold with a lightweight hedge and milestone-based upgrade triggers if progress proves durable.

## Investment Decision
Hold NFLX with a lightweight hedge to limit downside while preserving upside. Upgrade to Buy only after two consecutive quarters showing durable progress in ads, international ARPU, and positive cash flow. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Durable upside exists: Ads, international ARPU growth, and gaming/IP monetization can lift results over time.
- Near-term headwinds: Tax and regulatory headlines, ad-market cycles, and higher content spend could squeeze margins and cash flow soon.
- Hedged stance helps: A small hedge aims to shield against meaningful declines while still letting upside materialize.
- Clear upgrade criteria: If two straight quarters show sustained ad revenue growth, broader international ARPU gains, and improving cash flow, the case for Buy strengthens.

## Risks To Watch
- Ad revenue trajectory: Ad demand and performance could weaken, delaying monetization gains.
- International momentum and FX: ARPU growth abroad may stall, and currency effects can dampen results.
- Regulatory and tax moves: New rules or taxes could raise costs or limit growth in key markets.
- Content spend versus monetization: If content costs outpace monetization gains, margins and cash flow may stay pressured.
- Gaming/IP progress: Delays or weaker-than-expected uptake in gaming/IP monetization could slow upside.
