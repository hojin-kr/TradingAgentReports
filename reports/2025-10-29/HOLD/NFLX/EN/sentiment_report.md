Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull Reddit-based sentiment for NFLX, but the get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like there’s an internal issue with the data fetch (not something you did). I can’t pull the Reddit feed right now.

Here are your best options to keep moving:

- Retry now or later: I can retry the Reddit data pull for NFLX with the same date (2025-10-29) and continue the analysis as soon as the tool works.
- Use alternative data sources: I can assemble a comprehensive long report using other sources I can access or that you authorize (e.g., major headlines, publicly reported earnings/news, broader social sentiment from other platforms, and price/volume signals). I’ll still deliver a detailed, trader-focused analysis with actionable takeaways and a Markdown summary table.
- Wait for a fix and proceed with the full Reddit-focused report: If you’d rather stick to Reddit sentiment specifically, I’ll resume once the tool is back online and then finalize the report with the daily sentiment breakdown.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with an alternative approach, I can:
- Compile a sentiment-and-news narrative based on NFLX’s latest public announcements, earnings context, content slate, and macro factors affecting streaming.
- Provide a day-by-day sentiment framework (as available) and key catalysts for the upcoming week.
- Deliver a final report with a detailed markdown table of key points, potential trading implications, and risk factors.

Which path would you prefer? If you want the fastest path to a complete report, I can proceed with the alternative source approach now and label clearly where Reddit data would have augmented the insights.
