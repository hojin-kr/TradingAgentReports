Recommendation: Buy (overweight) Apple (AAPL) with a disciplined, hedged entry and defined risk controls.

Rationale (why this aligns with the plan)
- bull-case catalysts: Services growth, margin expansion from software/AI-enabled monetization, and a robust balance sheet that supports buybacks and optionality around AI-driven revenue streams.
- risk considerations balanced: Valuation in a high-rate regime, regulatory/tax/antitrust headwinds (Apps, China exposure), and macro volatility. These risks are acknowledged but viewed as manageable over a multi-quarter to multi-year horizon given the durability of the ecosystem and cash generation.
- multi-source discipline: The plan emphasizes not over-relying on any single signal; it relies on an eight-indicator framework, with hedging around earnings to protect against shocks.

Concrete actions and risk controls
- Position sizing: Start with 2–4% of the portfolio as an overweight Apple exposure; potential to scale up to 5–6% on durable confluence of signals.
- Entry triggers (data-anchored, but to be confirmed with live data if you want me to pull it):
  - Price above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (trend-confirming).
  - Bullish MACD cross with positive momentum; RSI in a healthy rising range (not overheated).
  - Price tests and closes above a near-term resistance with expanding volume (avoid excessive volatility).
  - If exact signals aren’t present, use a staged approach via a pullback to a defined support zone with bullish confirmation.
- Risk management and hedging:
  - Protective hedge around earnings window (protective puts or a collar via selling calls to finance puts).
  - Stop-loss: hard stop on a weekly close below the 200-day moving average or a clear support level.
  - Trailing stop: use ATR-based trailing stop to lock in gains as the position advances.
  - Discipline: scale back if volatility spikes or price becomes overextended on the upside.
- Earnings window and catalysts: Watch for Services margin expansion, AI monetization progress (Maps/subscriptions), and regional demand signals (China). Be prepared to trim exposure if guidance regresses or AI milestones are delayed.
- Monitoring framework: Track the eight-indicator framework (trend vs. moving averages; MACD/Momentum; RSI dynamics; Bollinger/ATR volatility). Seek signal confluence before adding or increasing exposure.
- Contingencies: If regulatory/regulatory risk intensifies or iPhone/device demand softens materially with valuation compression beyond conservative thresholds, be prepared to reduce risk or rotate into more defensive exposures.

Next steps
- If you want a sharper, numbers-backed playbook, I can pull current live data to generate exact entry/exit levels, stop placements, and precise price targets tailored to today’s price and volatility.
- If you prefer a time-horizon view, I can frame a 6–12 month or 24-month plan with milestones for Services growth, AI monetization milestones, and regulatory developments.

Learning from past decisions
- Treat AI monetization as multi-year optionality rather than a near-term driver; require quarterly milestones before lifting targets.
- Triangulate signals across earnings guidance, ecosystem monetization, and macro/regulatory indicators rather than relying on a single data point.
- Maintain hedges and defined risk controls, especially in a high-valuation, regulatory-risk environment.
