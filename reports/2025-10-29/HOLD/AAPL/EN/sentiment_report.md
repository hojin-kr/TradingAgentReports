Sorry about that — the Reddit data tool didn’t return data due to an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I can’t fetch the latest social sentiment data for AAPL right now.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now to see if the tool comes back online.
- Proceed with a best-effort analysis using the latest public context I can recall up to 2025-10-29 (not tied to the Reddit data pull), clearly marking any gaps.
- You provide the Reddit data or a few sample posts, and I’ll analyze those directly.
- Use any alternative data source you approve (if you can provide access or a link).

If you want me to proceed now with a best-effort analysis, I can:
- Outline potential sentiment drivers for AAPL around late-Oct 2025 (e.g., earnings cadence, product cycle expectations, macro factors).
- Identify likely themes to watch in social chatter (e.g., demand for iPhone lineup, services growth, AI/tech hardware discussions, supply chain chatter).
- Highlight how sentiment signals could interplay with recent news (without claiming specific data points).
- Provide a Markdown-friendly table structure at the end to organize key points (even if specific sentiment values are placeholders until we fetch data).

Please tell me which option you prefer.
