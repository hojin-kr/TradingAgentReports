Recommendation: Hold AMD right now.

Rationale aligned with the provided plan
- Core thesis remains: durable, multi-year AI infrastructure demand supported by high-visibility backlogs and strategic restructuring. However, the translation of backlog into repeatable earnings and margin leverage remains uncertain in the near term.
- Key risks to monitor: backlog quality and timing, Zen 6 cadence, and AMD’s ability to compete with Nvidia’s software ecosystem and total-cost-of-ownership advantages. Macro cycles and policy factors could also temper near-term demand.
- The plan’s stance is prudent: maintain exposure to benefit from longer-term AI infrastructure momentum, but avoid over-committing until clearer proof points emerge on backlog realization, Zen 6 timing, and margin improvement.

Catalysts and triggers to upgrade to Buy
- Clear and sustained backlog-to-revenue conversion, with multi-quarter visibility.
- Concrete Zen 6 cadence validation and near-term revenue/earnings impact.
- Evident margin leverage from manufacturing realignment (e.g., sustained margin uplift, gross margin expansion).
- Strengthened competitive positioning (e.g., software/ecosystem wins, or credible share gains against Nvidia).

Risk controls and position tuning (if you already own AMD)
- Maintain a modest exposure; avoid large new long additions until catalysts materialize.
- Implement risk guards: set stops on critical technical levels or deteriorating backlog quality, and consider hedges or collars to limit downside if macro or execution disappoints.
- Regular cadence reviews: reassess after earnings releases and key milestones (DOE/OpenAI deployments, partner announcements).

Bottom line
- Hold now. If the next few quarters deliver credible backlog conversion, clear Zen 6 timing, and sustained margin uplift, be prepared to upgrade to Buy. If those signals falter, reevaluate and adjust exposure downward.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
