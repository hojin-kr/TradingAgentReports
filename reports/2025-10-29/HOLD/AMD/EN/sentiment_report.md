Sorry — I tried to fetch AMD Reddit sentiment for 2025-10-29, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like an internal tool issue rather than something on your end. I can’t pull that Reddit data at the moment.

Here are options for how we can proceed, and what I can deliver in the meantime:

Options
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now: I can attempt another direct call in a moment to see if the internal path issue resolves.
- Proceed without Reddit data: I can still build a comprehensive AMD analysis using recent company news, public sentiment from other channels, and known context up to today. I’ll clearly note where Reddit data would have contributed and summarize other sources in detail.
- Use a hybrid approach: I’ll start with a robust AMD report based on available news and documented sentiment from other social platforms, and I’ll flag Reddit-specific themes and risk factors once Reddit data is accessible.

What I can deliver right now (without Reddit data)
- A long-form AMD analysis focused on:
  - Recent company news and product/market developments
  - Public sentiment themes from non-Reddit sources (e.g., earnings coverage, industry commentary, investor chatter on other platforms)
  - Sentiment drivers and potential catalysts for traders
  - Key risks and opportunities for AMD in the near term
  - Implications for traders and investors (short-term and longer-term)
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, sentiment drivers, and catalysts (with placeholders where Reddit data would go).

What I’ll include in the final report (structure)
- Executive snapshot
- Daily sentiment overview (with a note if Reddit data is unavailable)
- Thematic breakdown (e.g., AI/machine learning compute demand, CPU/GPU supply dynamics, competition, supply chain)
- News sentiment and notable announcements (earnings, partnerships, product launches, guidance)
- Quantitative sentiment indicators (when available) and their interpretation
- Trader takeaways: potential entry/exit timing considerations, volatility drivers, risk factors
- Appendix: data sources and methodology, with a placeholder for Reddit-specific findings

Draft Markdown table (structure you’ll get in the final report)
- Date | Source | Sentiment Theme | Headline/Topic | Signal (Positive/Negative) | Note
- (Table will be populated with actual items once data is compiled)

Would you like me to:
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now, hoping the internal issue resolves, or
2) Proceed with option 2 (no Reddit data) and start compiling the full AMD report using other sources? If you prefer, I can also try a hybrid approach and wait a bit to see if Reddit data comes in shortly.
