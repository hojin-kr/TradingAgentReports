I attempted to fetch SPY data to generate the indicators, but the data service is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. I retried, but the calls to retrieve the underlying data (and thus the indicators) are failing due to the same issue. I can retry automatically after a short interval or proceed with a data-forward plan if you’d like. In the meantime, here is a detailed, forward-looking plan and what I would deliver once the data is available, plus a concise framework you can act on now.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A data-driven, nuanced analysis using up to 8 complementary indicators (no redundancy) to assess SPY’s trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context.
- A clear narrative on how the current readings across these indicators converge or diverge, with traps and caveats for different market regimes (e.g., trending vs. range-bound).
- A practical set of actionable takeaways for entries, exits, risk management, and portfolio considerations, tailored to a SPY-specific macro/macro-equity context.

Recommended 8 indicators (diverse, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma (moving average, medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance)
- close_200_sma (long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation; golden/death cross context)
- close_10_ema (short-term momentum; quick shifts in price action)
- macd (momentum and trend-change signals via EMA differences)
- macds (MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD for trigger points)
- rsi (momentum strength and overbought/oversold zones; watch for divergences)
- boll (Bollinger Middle / 20 SMA; baseline for volatility-driven expansions/contractions)
- atr (true range-based volatility; helps with risk management and position sizing)

Why these are suitable for SPY in a mid-2025 context (conceptual rationale)
- Trend anchors (50SMA and 200SMA) provide a robust view of the ongoing macro trend and can help filter noise from faster oscillations.
- Momentum signals (10 EMA, MACD, MACD Signal, RSI) offer insight into the strength and timing of moves, helping differentiate sustainable moves from pullbacks or rallies that lack follow-through.
- Volatility and risk context (ATR, Bollinger baseline) illuminate the current dispersion and potential breakout/breakdown zones, which is critical for SPY given episodic macro headlines.
- Volume-adjacent view (VWMA) would add an optional layer for confirming price moves with volume, but I’ve prioritized the eight above to avoid overloading with overlapping signals. If you’d like, VWMA can replace one of the indicators for a volume-focused angle.

What I will look for in detail (when data is available)
- Trend confirmation:
  - Price trading above both 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA; look for bullish regime. A cross of 50SMA over 200SMA (golden cross) would be a bullish structural signal.
  - Price dipping below both moving averages with 50SMA below 200SMA indicates bearish regime and reinforces downside risk.
- Momentum cues:
  - MACD line crossing above MACD Signal in the context of price above major moving averages suggests a strengthening up-move; the opposite for a down-move.
  - RSI near or above 70 with price stalling at resistance could indicate overbought risk, especially if price action diverges from RSI (bearish divergence).
  - RSI below 30 with price near support and other bullish signals could present a potential bottoming setup.
- Volatility and breakout context:
  - ATR rising while price consolidates near resistance may signal imminent breakout risk; consider wider stops or smaller position sizing until breakout direction is confirmed.
  - Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) aligning with price direction and price touching or breaking the upper/lower bands with confirmation from MACD/RSI can signal breakout or reversal zones, depending on regime.
- Volume-anchored confirmation (if added later):
  - Price move accompanied by VWMA confirmation (price above VWMA with rising VWMA) would strengthen conviction; price move on low volume would warrant caution.

Proposed next steps (choose one)
- Option A: I retry data retrieval now and generate the full 8-indicator report with a detailed trend/momentum/volatility analysis and a final table (as requested).
- Option B: If you prefer to proceed immediately, I can provide a data-free but rigorous framework (signals to watch, threshold guidelines, risk parameters, and a table) you can apply once data comes in.

Current status summary
- Data fetch: Pending due to an internal service error (FileNotFoundError). I will retry automatically on your confirmation or after a short wait, or we can proceed with the qualitative plan above and populate the exact readings once the data is retrieved.

Would you like me to retry fetching SPY data now and proceed with the full 8-indicator report, or would you prefer I proceed immediately with the qualitative framework and plan to populate the table once data is available?
