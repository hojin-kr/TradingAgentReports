Option B chosen: Proceed with a rigorous, scenario-based bear thesis with stock-level drill-down, regardless of live data. Based on the investment plan you provided and the current data-gap/ macro/regulatory concerns, my actionable stance is to HOLD QQQ with hedges until clearer momentum and signals emerge.

Recommendation: HOLD (with hedging and disciplined risk controls)

Rationale aligned with the plan:
- Macro-rate sensitivity and regulatory headwinds remain meaningful risks for a rate-sensitive, high-valuation index like QQQ. This supports a cautious stance rather than outright buying.
- Data-gap ambiguity (no live indicator readings) reduces risk control and timing precision, making large long exposure less attractive in the near term.
- Long-run AI/cloud monetization thesis is intact, but the current setup favors wait-for-signal discipline to avoid premature exposure.

Concrete risk-management actions (today):
- Hedging: implement protective hedges on the mega-cap exposure (QQQ or top-weighted holdings) via:
  - Protective puts or a collar around core exposure to cap downside.
  - Consider a modest long-vol sleeve to hedge against episodic macro shocks if risk tolerance allows.
- Positioning discipline: avoid deploying full new long cash-equivalents in mega-cap stars until live momentum/trend signals reappear.
  If you already hold some exposure, limit incremental add-ons to highly liquid, clearly monetizable AI/cloud names with visible free cash flow progress and ARPU expansion.

Monitoring and signal framework (post-hedge):
- Data restoration triggers: look for confirmation of momentum/trend alignment (e.g., MACD cross, RSI within constructive ranges, price above key moving averages) before increasing exposure.
- Fundamental checks: monitoring AI/cloud monetization milestones (ARPU uplift, renewal velocity, operating margin improvement) and cash-flow signals (FCF yield, buyback activity).
- Macro/regulatory updates: stay attentive to rate trajectory, inflation surprises, and any regulatory developments affecting big tech.
- Risk limits: enforce defined drawdown thresholds and stop levels on the held/hedged exposure; set re-entry thresholds if momentum proves durable.

Operational plan if signals improve:
- Gradual re-entry into long exposure to mega-cap leaders with robust AI monetization, rather than a full, immediate allocation.
- Maintain a data-backed, staged approach to capital deployment to manage risk and capture durable upside.

Bottom line:
- The most persuasive risks are macro-rate sensitivity, regulatory headwinds, concentration risk, and the data-gap complicating risk controls. These factors justify a Hold with hedges rather than adding outright exposure now. If and when live data confirms momentum and macro conditions stabilize or improve, a measured, disciplined re-entry into mega-cap AI/cloud leaders is appropriate.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
