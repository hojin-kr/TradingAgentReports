# Investment Report: TSLA
## Executive Summary
Tesla faces near-term risks from uncertain software monetization, high capital needs that weigh cash flow, and China regulatory risk. A disciplined hold with hedges and milestone-driven engagement preserves upside while protecting capital until progress lands.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence: Medium

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term monetization is uncertain: Revenue from software/services is likely to grow gradually, not in a single move.
- Capital intensity hurts cash flow: Ongoing investment in plants and technology weighs on near-term financials.
- China policy/regulatory risk: Shifts in policy could impact demand or margins.
- Strong optionality remains: Potential upside from software monetization, energy deployments, and connected services.
- Hedge and milestone approach reduces risk: Maintaining hedges and waiting for verifiable progress helps balance risk and upside.

## Risks To Watch
- Monetization timing and scale: If software/services ramp delays or undershoots, upside could shrink.
- Capital spending and cash flow: Higher-than-expected capex could worsen liquidity.
- China policy changes: Regulatory shifts could quickly tilt the risk/reward.
- Macro or demand headwinds: Economic softness or supply chain issues could lower vehicle demand.
