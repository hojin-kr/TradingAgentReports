Thanks for the patience. I tried to fetch the latest Reddit stock data for NVDA, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the fetch now, or proceed with a structured outline and fill in the details as soon as I have the data. Which would you prefer?

Option A: Retry data fetch now
- I’ll re-run the Reddit data query for NVDA for 2025-10-29 and then generate a full, data-driven long report (daily sentiment, top threads, themes, and implications for traders) with a final Markdown table.

Option B: Proceed with a skeleton + plan
- I’ll deliver a comprehensive report outline with methodology, what I will measure, and how I’ll interpret the signals. I’ll populate the results as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

If you want me to proceed immediately with Option B, here’s the plan I’ll follow and the structure I’ll deliver:

What I will analyze
- Social media sentiment: daily sentiment and volume on NVDA-related posts over the past 7 days (with emphasis on Reddit; I’ll also note any cross-posted themes from other platforms if data becomes available).
- Top themes and narratives: key topics (e.g., AI demand, data center growth, product roadmap, supply chain, earnings expectations, regulatory concerns, margin/price pressure).
- Notable threads and influencers: identify the most impactful threads or commenters and summarize their viewpoints and potential market impact.
- Recent company news: summarize the headlines from the past week that might drive sentiment or risk (product announcements, earnings previews, partnerships, regulatory updates).
- Sentiment dynamics: day-by-day sentiment trend, spikes corresponding to news or headlines, and any divergences between sentiment and price action (if price data is considered later).
- Implications for traders: interpretation of sentiment signals for NVDA (timing for entries/exits, risk management, potential catalysts, and caveats).

Proposed structure of the final long report
1) Executive snapshot
- One-page summary of the week: sentiment tone (overall positive/neutral/negative), key drivers, and the implied risk/reward for short-term and longer-term investors.

2) Daily sentiment and thread-level view
- Day-by-day sentiment scores and post volumes.
- Brief bullets of the top 3-5 threads each day with themes and any notable quotes or positions.

3) Thematic analysis
- Categorized themes (AI demand, data centers, product cycles, margins/costs, supply chain, policy/regulation, guidance expectations).
- Theme sentiment scores and any notable changes over the week.

4) News roundup and catalysts
- Short digest of relevant news headlines from the past week and their likely impact on sentiment and price.

5) Risk assessment and counterpoints
- What could invalidate the sentiment signals.
- Key risks (e.g., macro AI demand shifts, supply constraints, regulatory headwinds).

6) Trading implications
- Scenarios for different sentiment outcomes.
- Suggested risk controls and volatility considerations.

7) Visuals and data notes (recommended)
- A few charts or bullet-point visuals to accompany the text (e.g., daily sentiment trend, top themes by day, notable news events timeline).

8) Makrdown table (to be appended)
- A concise table organizing key takeaways, catalysts, sentiment notes, and trading implications for quick reference.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll re-run the Reddit data fetch for NVDA for 2025-10-29 and deliver the full, data-backed long report with the Markdown table at the end.

Please tell me which option you prefer.
