Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the Reddit stock data for GOOGL using the provided tool, but I’m running into a tool error:

- Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

What this means: the Reddit data source (as wired into the tool) is currently unavailable or misconfigured. I attempted multiple times for the target date (2025-10-29) and keep hitting the same error.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can attempt another immediate retry to see if the source comes back online.
- Retry later: I can queue and retry after a short interval (e.g., 5–10 minutes) if you’d like.
- Alternative path: I can proceed with a comprehensive long-form analysis using other sources (e.g., general news, public sentiment signals, regulatory/AI developments, and Alphabet/GOOGL-specific headlines) and clearly label any sentiment data that would have come from Reddit as pending or placeholders until the Reddit tool is available again.
- Hybird: I can draft the full report structure now with placeholders for Reddit-derived sentiment, then fill in once the Reddit tool is back.

If you’d like me to continue right away, I suggest the hybrid approach: I’ll start a thorough long report framework focusing on fundamentals, recent company news, and publicly observable sentiment signals from other sources, with a clearly labeled section for Reddit sentiment data that will be updated as soon as the Reddit tool is operational again. You’ll get a robust draft you can use immediately, plus a plan for the Reddit-specific updates.

Before I proceed, please choose one:
1) Retry Reddit data now (I’ll attempt another call immediately).
2) Proceed with a full report using non-Reddit sources first (clearly labeled Reddit sections as pending).
3) Schedule a retry path (e.g., I’ll retry in 10 minutes and update you).

If you have any preferences on focus areas (e.g., AI strategy, cloud growth, ad revenue dynamics, regulatory risk, YouTube monetization), tell me now and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.
