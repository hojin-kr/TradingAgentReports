Recommendation: Buy Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG)

Rationale (why a Buy now)
- The multi-front AI monetization thesis remains intact: ads, YouTube, and Google Cloud offer complementary growth paths, reducing reliance on any single lever and improving the durability of cash generation.
- Alphabet’s ecosystem moat and the Gemini momentum, plus CMA clearance for Anthropic-related initiatives, lower meaningful tail risks and support a more favorable risk-reward.
- Financial strength provides optionality: strong balance sheet, buyback capacity, and potential capital allocation flexibility to fund growth or offset earnings volatility.
- Bear risks are acknowledged (valuation, ad-cycle sensitivity, regulatory pressure), but the plan’s risk controls and hedging framework are designed to manage these effectively.

Actionable execution plan (short, practical steps)
- Core positioning and sizing
  - Establish and scale a core long position in GOOGL/GOOG with a disciplined size (e.g., 15-25% of your equity sleeve, depending on overall risk tolerance and diversification).
  - Use a staged entry: add into strength when key trend confirmations fire (detailed indicators below).

- Entry criteria (eight-indicator framework, to guide timing)
  - Price above 50-day and 200-day moving averages
  - MACD positive and rising; MACD histogram trending higher
  - RSI not in overbought territory
  - ATR rising modestly (indicating healthy volatility without outsized spikes)
  - VWMA price above VWMA and trending up
  - Use these signals to incrementalize sizing rather than chase

- Earnings risk management: collar strategy to hedge around the next earnings cycle
  - Implement a collar: buy an OTM put to protect downside and sell an OTM call to help pay for the put
  - Put: OTM strike roughly 5-10% below current price, expiration aligned with earnings cycle
  - Call: OTM strike roughly 5-10% above current price, same expiration
  - Goal: define risk, potentially finance cost of protection, and still allow for limited upside
  - Alternative if you prefer more upside: consider a diagonal spread or delta-hedged long calls funded by a shorter-dated higher-strike call

- Risk controls and portfolio hygiene
  - Cap total Alphabet exposure to a defined portion of your equity sleeve (e.g., 15-25%)
  - Use ATR-based trailing stops on the core position; define risk for the collar to avoid larger-than-expected drawdowns
  - Maintain diversification across mega-cap tech to avoid single-name concentration risk

- Data and sentiment inputs
  - Use Reddit sentiment or other social signals as a supplementary timing tool, not a primary driver
  - Rely primarily on fundamentals and the eight-indicator framework for day-to-day decisions

- Review cadence
  - Reassess post-earnings and quarterly updates: AI monetization progress, cloud margins, capex discipline, regulatory developments
  - If the price weakens meaningfully against the eight indicators (e.g., price breaks below major moving averages with MACD turning negative), consider trimming or hedging

What to monitor next
- AI monetization traction across ads, YouTube, and Cloud (margin trajectory)
- Cloud enterprise growth and unit economics as AI workloads scale
- Regulatory developments affecting AI-related initiatives and data/privacy
- Capital allocation signals (buybacks, dividends, buybacks pace)

Bottom line
- This plan supports a constructive, risk-managed Buy of Alphabet, balancing the strong, multi-faceted AI growth thesis with disciplined hedges and clear risk controls around earnings and macro/regulatory risks.
