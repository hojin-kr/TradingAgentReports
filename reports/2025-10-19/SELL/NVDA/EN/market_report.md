 Data retrieval issue: I attempted to fetch NVDA data and run the indicator analyses, but the data access layer returned a FileNotFoundError. I can proceed as soon as the data source is reachable again. In the meantime, I’ll provide a detailed, ready-to-use indicator setup and how to interpret NVDA given the likely market context. Once the data fetch works, I will generate the live readings and a full, NVDA-specific trend report.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, diverse and complementary)
Reason for selection:
- Moving Averages (trend direction, support/resistance)
  1) close_10_ema
     - Short-term momentum signal; quick to respond to price moves. Helps catch early shifts in NVDA’s intraday/daily momentum.
  2) close_50_sma
     - Medium-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming the prevailing trend and dynamic support/resistance.
  3) close_200_sma
     - Long-term trend anchor; helps identify major regime shifts (e.g., golden/death crosses) and filters noise from shorter timeframes.

- MACD family (momentum and trend changes)
  4) macd
     - Core momentum indicator; crossovers can hint at trend changes.
  5) macds
     - MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD provide more robust entry/exit cues than MACD alone.
  6) macdh
     - MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and helps spot divergences early.

- Momentum (overbought/oversold context)
  7) rsi
     - Momentum gauge with clear overbought/oversold thresholds; useful for divergence checks when NVDA is in high-velocity moves.

- Volatility/volatility-based risk control
  8) atr
     - Measures current volatility; informs stop placement and position sizing in a volatile name like NVDA.

Notes on suitability for NVDA
- NVDA tends to exhibit strong momentum and pronounced moves around AI-cycle news, earnings, and tech-sector flows. The chosen set balances trend direction (10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA), momentum and crossovers (MACD trio), momentum intensity (RSI), and risk management (ATR). This combination reduces reliance on a single signal source and helps filter false positives in a volatile, high-beta stock.

What to look for once data is available (interpretation framework)
- Trend confirmation
  - If 50_sma and 200_sma are rising and the price remains above both, the intermediate-to-long-term trend is bullish. A golden cross (50_sma crossing above 200_sma) would strengthen the bullish thesis; a death cross would warrant caution.
  - 10_ema crossing above price with the price above 50_sma can signal continued upside momentum; crossing below could warn of exhaustion.

- Momentum signals
  - MACD crossing above its signal line (and both above zero) reinforces bullish momentum; crossing below suggests waning momentum.
  - MACD histogram rising toward positive indicates strengthening momentum; a shrinking or negative histogram cautions on durability of the move.
  - RSI approaching or exceeding typical overbought levels (e.g., above 70) in a strong uptrend is common; look for bullish price action staying above key supports or RSI divergences to anticipate further upside vs. potential pullbacks.

- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising indicates expanding volatility; consider wider stops or smaller position sizing to adapt to risk.
  - In high-volatility phases, rely more on MACD and trend alignment than on RSI alone to avoid false reversal signals.

- Consolidation/sequence checks
  - If price compresses near support (e.g., around the 50_sma) with RSI failing to reach overbought, a breakout attempt may occur. Confirm with MACD/histogram signs and a cross of 10_ema with price for a clean entry.

What to monitor next (practical notes)
- Watch for key crossovers: 10_ema crossing above/below price near the 50_sma; 50_sma crossing 200_sma for trend regime shifts.
- Track MACD line and MACD histogram in tandem with RSI to separate momentum strength from potential pullbacks in an otherwise bullish trend.
- Use ATR to calibrate stop-loss placement after earnings or AI-cycle catalysts, as Nvidia often experiences jumpy but directional moves.

Appendix: quick reference table (key points)
| Indicator | What it signals | Typical trader interpretation in NVDA context |
|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum direction | Quick momentum shifts; use with longer MA filters for entries |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and support/resistance | Trend confirmation; watch for cross with 200_sma |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend direction | Major regime indicator; golden/death cross relevance |
| macd | Momentum trend changes | Crossovers signal entries/exits; confirm with histogram |
| macds | MACD signal line behavior | Crossovers with MACD add robustness to signals |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Divergences and histogram changes highlight momentum shifts |
| rsi | Momentum extreme conditions | Overbought/oversold cues; watch for divergences or price action context |
| atr | Volatility level | Risk management: adjust stops/position size to volatility |

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval and generate NVDA’s live indicator readings for the chosen 8 indicators, along with a detailed trend narrative and a formatted table of the current signals.
- If data access remains unavailable, I can provide an interpretation based on last known signals and outline a watchlist-driven plan for the next trading session.

Would you like me to attempt the data fetch again now, or should we proceed with a scenario-based analysis using recently observed patterns for NVDA?
