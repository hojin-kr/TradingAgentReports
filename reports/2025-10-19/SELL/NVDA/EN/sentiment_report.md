I tried to fetch the latest Reddit stock news for NVDA, but the tool returned an error: FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory. It looks like the Reddit data backend isn’t returning data right now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry the Reddit data pull shortly to get Reddit-specific sentiment data for NVDA.
- Switch to an alternative data approach now and build the NVDA sentiment and news analysis from other sources (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits, general finance news, and public press releases). I can then synthesize a robust weekly view and provide traders’ takeaways.

If you’d like me to proceed immediately with an alternativeData approach, I can deliver a comprehensive NVDA report covering:
- Public sentiment from multiple channels (daily sentiment trend over the past 7 days, notable spikes, and potential drivers)
- Key company news in the last week (earnings notes, product/partnership announcements, regulatory or geopolitical factors affecting NVDA)
- Thematic analysis from social chatter (AI demand, data center capacity, supply chain, competition, policy/regulation)
- Implications for traders (risk/volatility, potential catalysts, scenario-based outcomes)
- A concise, organized Markdown table summarizing key points

Please tell me which path you prefer:
1) Retry the Reddit tool now, or
2) Proceed with alternative sources for a weekly NVDA sentiment and news report.
