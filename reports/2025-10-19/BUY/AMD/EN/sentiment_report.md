Apologies — I tried to fetch AMD Reddit stock data for 2025-10-19, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source is currently unavailable on my end. I can either retry the tool now, or pivot to a best-effort AMD sentiment/news report using other publicly available signals. Which would you prefer?

If you’d like me to proceed now without Reddit data, I can still deliver a comprehensive AMD analysis focused on social sentiment and recent news from other sources, and clearly note the data gaps. Here’s how I can proceed and what you’ll get:

What I can deliver now (without Reddit data)
- Overview: A structured, trader-focused AMD sentiment and news snapshot for the past week (roughly 2025-10-12 to 2025-10-19), including:
  - Public sentiment signals from non-Reddit sources (e.g., major news outlets, industry blogs, general social media chatter where accessible, and earnings/PR coverage).
  - Key news catalysts in the past week (product announcements, partnerships, earnings-related or guidance updates, supply-demand signals, macro factors).
  - Analysis of how sentiment themes align with or diverge from actual news catalysts.
  - Potential implications for traders (short-term volatility catalysts, risk factors, and positioning ideas).

- Output style: A detailed narrative report with data-driven observations, followed by a concise, organized summary table for quick reference.

- Limitations: No Reddit-specific sentiment by day; other sources may not perfectly mirror Reddit discourse. I will explicitly call out any gaps and caveats.

If you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch
- I can immediately retry the AMD data pull for 2025-10-19. If the tool comes back online, I’ll integrate those daily Reddit sentiment signals into the same report, preserving the same structure and depth.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry the Reddit data retrieval now, or
2) Proceed with the non-Reddit AMD sentiment/news report and table right away?

Either way, I’ll include a Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, drivers, sentiment stance, and notable risks for traders.
