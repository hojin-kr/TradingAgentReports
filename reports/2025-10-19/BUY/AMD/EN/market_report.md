I’m running into a data retrieval issue right now. The AMD Yahoo Finance data pull failed with a FileNotFoundError (“No such file or directory”). I can retry fetching the data immediately if you’d like, or we can proceed with a data-less planning stage and run the indicators as soon as the data is available.

In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) that provide complementary insights for AMD, a volatile semiconductors name, without redundancy. Once the data pull succeeds, I’ll compute and interpret them together.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Identify the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance; helps confirm trend direction when price is near the 50 SMA.
  - Rationale for AMD: AMD often trends on product cycles and earnings; 50 SMA helps filter choppiness and indicates potential pullbacks or rallies around a recognized trend line.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Establish long-term trend context; look for golden/death cross signals with shorter moving averages.
  - Rationale for AMD: Long-term trend context is useful for positioning around major earnings cycles and macro moves; helps avoid getting caught in premature trades during volatility spikes.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Capture quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points; more responsive than the longer SMAs.
  - Rationale for AMD: Useful for early signals during earnings-driven moves or sudden price squeezes; helps with timely entries when paired with longer-term trend filters.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line crossovers; detects shifts in momentum.
  - Rationale for AMD: MACD helps confirm trend changes in a stock known for sharp moves around catalysts.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: MACD Signal line; crossovers with MACD provide trigger signals.
  - Rationale for AMD: Adds a smoothing layer to MACD signals, reducing false positives in volatile periods.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: MACD Histogram; visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential.
  - Rationale for AMD: Divergence or momentum buildup can precede larger moves in the stock around product cycles or demand news.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Purpose: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold cues; watch for divergences.
  - Rationale for AMD: RSI helps identify approaching reversals during overextended moves or pullbacks after earnings surges; useful with trend filters to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- boll
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Purpose: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a dynamic benchmark; used with bands to spot breakouts or reversals.
  - Rationale for AMD: The stock often trades in volatile ranges; boll middle provides a baseline for price deviations and helps time breakouts when used with bands and other momentum/trend clues.

What I’ll deliver once the data fetch succeeds
- A detailed, nuanced report on the current AMD setup, describing:
  - Trend direction from the 50/200 SMAs and 10 EMA
  - Momentum signals from MACD family and RSI
  - Volatility and breakout context from Bollinger middle (and optionally bands)
  - Any notable divergences between price action and indicators
  - Practical trade considerations: potential entry/exit zones, stop placement guidance (using ATR if available), and risk considerations around upcoming catalysts (eras, product launches, demand cycles)
- A concise, trader-friendly interpretation that highlights potential scenarios (bullish continuation, pullback opportunities, or consolidation) with caveats about data lag and earnings risk.

Please let me know if you’d like me to retry pulling the AMD data now. If you approve, I’ll re-run the data fetch and then generate the full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators above and a detailed interpretation, plus a Markdown table of key points at the end.
