Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch Reddit sentiment data for AAPL on 2025-10-19 via the get_reddit_stock_info tool, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). It looks like a path/config problem on the tool side rather than an invalid query. I can retry, but I want to keep you in control about next steps.

Options for moving forward
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (same parameters: AAPL, 2025-10-19). If it fails again, I’ll report the error and switch to an alternate plan.
- Proceed with a broader sentiment/news analysis using other visible public signals (e.g., general press coverage, major Apple news, earnings commentary) if you’re able to provide sources or if you’re okay with me outlining a robust framework and waiting for the Reddit tool to come back online.
- If you prefer, I can continue with a high-confidence framework for the long report and fill in data once the tool is available again.

What I will deliver in the long report (once data access is stable)
- A comprehensive, data-driven analysis of social media and news signals for Apple (AAPL) over the past week, focusing on sentiment, themes, and potential price implications.
- Fine-grained daily sentiment breakdown, key topics driving discussions, and any notable sentiment divergence between days.
- Impactful news events and their potential market impact, with an eye toward catalysts and risk factors for traders (short-term swings vs. longer-term positioning).
- Practical takeaways for traders, including sentiment-driven reaction patterns, possible overhangs, and entry/exit considerations.
- A concise, readable Markdown table at the end summarizing key points.

Planned structure of the final report (rough outline)
- Executive snapshot: sentiment trend summary, notable daily swings, and headline news.
- Daily sentiment and themes: a day-by-day breakdown (positivity/negativity, dominant topics like iPhone cadence, services, AI features, supply chain, regulatory items, etc.).
- News catalysts: major Apple-related developments (product rumors/launches, earnings, regulatory updates, supply chain news, competitor moves).
- Sentiment vs. price correlation: any observed patterns in the past week (if data supports it).
- Risk factors and caveats: data reliability, potential biases in social sentiment data.
- Implications for traders: recommended posture windows, risk/positioning ideas, and watchlist triggers.
- Appendix: data sources, methodology, and definitions.

If you’d like, I can attempt the Reddit fetch again now and report back with the results as soon as it succeeds or fails. Please tell me which path you prefer:
1) Retry Reddit data fetch now.
2) Proceed with the framework-based analysis using alternate sources (you can provide links or allow me to proceed with a best-effort approach using publicly known signals).
3) Wait and try again later (specify a window if you want).
