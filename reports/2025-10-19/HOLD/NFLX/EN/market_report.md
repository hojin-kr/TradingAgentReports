I attempted to fetch NFLX data and run the requested indicators, but the data-access tools are currently returning a FileNotFoundError. I can’t retrieve NFLX data right this moment. If you’d like, I can retry in a moment, or proceed with a detailed indicator plan and qualitative analysis based on typical NFLX behavior until the data tools come back online. Let me know your preference.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that would give you complementary, non-redundant insights for NFLX (based on a generic, momentum-trend driven approach suitable for a large-cap growth stock). I’ve included the rationale and how to interpret signals when data becomes available.

Selected indicators (8)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Rationale and how to use together
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum proxy. Use to spot quick shifts and potential entry points, but filter with longer-term trends to avoid whipsaws in choppy markets.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance reference. Helps confirm the market’s prevailing trend and acts as a bridge between short-term signals and long-term context.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Use to confirm strategic trend direction (e.g., if price remains above the 200 SMA, bullish posture; below, bearish). Also useful for identifying golden/death cross relevance when paired with the 50 SMA.
- macd: Core momentum indicator based on EMA differences. Look for MACD line crossovers of the signal line, zero-line crossings, and MACD histogram trends to gauge changes in momentum.
- macds: MACD signal line. Crosses with MACD can provide more reliable entry/exit triggers when aligned with other signals.
- macdh: MACD histogram. Shows momentum strength and potential divergence early. Useful to confirm MACD cross signals and to spot weakening momentum before price moves.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold context. Typical thresholds are 70/30; watch for divergences against price to anticipate reversals, especially if the trend is strong (RSI can remain extended in uptrends).
- atr: Volatility gauge. Helps set risk management rules (stop distances, position sizing) and interpret breakout strength in conjunction with price moves. Rising ATR often accompanies breakouts; falling ATR may accompany consolidations.

How I’d interpret signals once data is available
- Trend confirmation: Use 50_sma and 200_sma to confirm the broader trend. If price trading above both with the 50 SMA above the 200 SMA, tilt toward bullish setups; if price is below both and the 50 SMA is below the 200 SMA, lean bearish.
- Entry timing: Look for a bullish setup when close_10_ema crosses above price action confirmed by price holding above the 50 SMA, MACD turning positive with MACD histogram rising, and RSI rising but not yet in overbought territory. Conversely, for bearish entries, wait for close_10_ema crossing below, price below the 50 SMA, MACD turning negative with negative histogram, and RSI rolling over from overbought.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and RSI should align with the price trend. Divergences between RSI and price warrant caution even if MACD signals look favorable.
- Volatility management: Use ATR to adjust position size and stop distance. A rising ATR around a breakout suggests stronger follow-through potential; a contracting ATR may imply a consolidation phase where signals require tighter risk controls.
- Risk controls: Combine ATR-based stop placement with a trailing approach as MACD and RSI confirm momentum shifts, ensuring that you don’t over-allocate on a single signal in a volatile name like NFLX.

Next steps
- I can immediately retry pulling NFLX data and run these 8 indicators as soon as the data tool is available again.
- Alternatively, if you’d prefer a qualitative assessment right now, I can provide a scenario-based outlook for NFLX using common patterns (without numerical signals) and then map to the 8 indicators once data returns.

Appendix: quick reference table (indicator roles and decision cues)
- close_10_ema: Fast momentum; use for early entry/exit hints.
- close_50_sma: Trend direction; confirms intermediate-term context.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend; strategic bias and major cross reference.
- macd: Momentum crossovers; primary trigger signals when aligned with price trend.
- macds: Signal-line cross; reduces false positives with MACD.
- macdh: Momentum strength/divergence; early warning of changes.
- rsi: Overbought/oversold and divergence checks; adds a counterbalance to trend.
- atr: Volatility and risk sizing; anchors stop levels and position sizing.

Proposed output format once data is available
- A detailed narrative of NFLX’s current trend, momentum, volatility, and potential trade setups.
- A synthesized signal table showing how the eight indicators align and what trade ideas they imply.
- A concise “watchlist and risk” section with scenario-based signals.

Markdown table: key points and interpretations (to be populated with actual data once available)
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for NFLX | Trade signal concept (example) |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | If above price or rising, bullish short-term momentum; cross above price can hint at entry | Bullish cross near support with rising RSI |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Price above 50 SMA indicates uptrend; below indicates downtrend | Price crossing above 50 SMA with MACD positive |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Price above 200 SMA signals long-term bullish bias; vice versa | Golden/death cross considerations with 50 SMA |
| macd | Momentum trend, EMA differences | Positive MACD and rising histogram suggest bullish momentum | MACD line crossing above signal while price holds above key support |
| macds | MACD signal line | Crosses with MACD add confirmation | MACD above signal with histogram increasing |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Divergence or histogram expansion signals momentum shifts | Histogram rising with price breakout |
| rsi | Relative momentum | Overbought/oversold zones; divergence signals potential reversals | RSI moving from oversold toward neutral with price breakout |
| atr | Volatility | Rising ATR supports breakout validity; falling ATR implies consolidation | ATR spike near breakout supports risk-managed entry |
