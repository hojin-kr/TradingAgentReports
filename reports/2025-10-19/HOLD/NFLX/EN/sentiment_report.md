Sorry—I'm hitting a tool error fetching Reddit data for NFLX right now (FileNotFoundError from the Reddit info tool). I can’t pull the daily sentiment feed at the moment.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry fetching Reddit data now (I’ll attempt again immediately).
- Retry after a short delay and monitor for a successful fetch.
- Proceed with an alternative approach: I can draft the full long-form report using other available sources (public news headlines, sentiment from other platforms like X/Twitter, StockTwits, etc.) and flag where Reddit data would have sharpened the insights.
- If you have other data sources you want me to pull from, share them and I’ll integrate.

If you want me to retry now, I’ll kick it off again and then deliver the full, detailed NFLX report with a Markdown table at the end as requested. Also, please confirm the date range you want covered (I was planning the past week as of 2025-10-19).
