I’m running into a tool issue fetching Reddit stock data for TSLA on 2025-10-19 (FileNotFoundError). I can retry immediately, or switch to an alternative data set (e.g., other social platforms, news headlines, official company updates) to produce a comprehensive TSLA sentiment/ news report for the past week. How would you like to proceed?

Options:
- Retry Reddit data now and then deliver a full, traders-focused report (sentiment by day, Reddit threads, up-to-date headlines, implications for TSLA).
- Proceed with an alternative data mix (news outlets, official Tesla announcements, public sentiment from Twitter/X, forums) and deliver a detailed report with the same depth, clearly noting Reddit data is unavailable for this run.
- Provide a high-level framework and structure first (no data injected yet) so you can review the approach before I fetch data.

What I can deliver regardless of option chosen:
- A comprehensive, trader-oriented long report analyzing social media sentiment (daily and overall trends), recent company news, and their implications for TSLA over the past week.
- Fine-grained insights, not just “mixed” sentiment—quasi-quantified signals, key drivers, and scenario-based implications for different time horizons.
- A final Markdown table at the end to organize key points.

Draft structure I will follow (and can adjust to your preference):
- Executive snapshot: overall sentiment tone, notable headlines, and a quick read on potential momentum catalysts.
- Daily sentiment deep-dive (past 7 days): day-by-day sentiment shifts, notable posts, and any correlation with major headlines or price moves.
- News roundup: 5–10 most impactful news items (earnings hints, product updates, regulatory news, supply chain, competition) and each item’s potential price/volatility impact.
- Sentiment sources synthesis: how Reddit (if available), Twitter/X, and other platforms align or diverge on TSLA’s narrative.
- Key drivers and risk factors: what’s driving sentiment now (AI, FSD, energy products, margin discipline, supply chain, competition) and what could disrupt it.
- Trading implications and scenarios: base case, bull case, bear case with time horizons (intraday, 1–2 weeks, 1–3 months).
- Caveats and data quality notes: data limitations, potential biases, and what to watch for next.
- Actionable takeaways for traders: watch lists, catalysts, and risk controls.

If you’d like, I can proceed now with a retry for the Reddit data and then deliver the full report with the Markdown table appended. Also, tell me if you prefer:
- A tight 1–2 page summary plus a detailed appendix, or
- A single, comprehensive long-form report with the table included at the end.

To set expectations, here is the Markdown table skeleton I will append at the end of the final report (you’ll see filled data after I fetch the sources):
- Columns: Date, Topic/Headline, Source, Sentiment, Key Drivers, Impact Level (Low/Med/High), Trader takeaway
- Rows: one per notable item from the past week (once data is in)

Please tell me which data path you prefer (retry Reddit now or switch to alternative sources), and I’ll proceed accordingly.
