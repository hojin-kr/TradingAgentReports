I attempted to fetch TSLA data to compute the indicators, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError. That means the data source/CSV isn’t available right now, so I can’t generate the live indicator readings or a current trend report at this moment. I can proceed in two ways: (a) retry as soon as the data source is back, or (b) proceed with a carefully chosen indicator set and a detailed plan so we’re ready to run the numbers the moment the data is accessible. Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here is a detailed plan tailored to TSLA, plus a compact 8-indicator set that provides complementary insights once data is retrievable.

Recommended 8 indicators (complementary, non-redundant mix)
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Why these indicators are suitable for TSLA (late-2024 to 2025 context: high volatility, tech/auto sector catalysts, news-driven moves)
- macd, macds, macdh (MACD family): TSLA often experiences momentum shifts around earnings, product news, or policy events. Using all three components lets us gauge:
  - MACD line vs signal for momentum crossovers (macd vs macds) as potential entry/exit signals.
  - MACD histogram (macdh) to visualize momentum strength and potential divergences ahead of price moves.
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum gauge. In TSLA’s volatile environment, price crossing or trading above/below the 10 EMA can hint at short-term trend shifts or pullback entries.
- close_50_sma: The mid-term trend anchor. TSLA often respects major trend direction relative to the 50 SMA; price above suggests alignment with a broader uptrend, price below suggests risk of a trend change or consolidation.
- rsi: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold context. Useful for spotting potential reversals or for warning that strong trends can push RSI into extreme zones for extended periods.
- atr: Measures current volatility. Important for sizing risk and setting stop distances in a stock known for wide intraday swings.
- vwma: Volume-weighted trend confirmation. TSLA moves with news and volume surges; VWMA helps confirm moves when price action aligns with heavy volume.

How I’ll interpret signals (once data is available)
- MACD family (macd, macds, macdh)
  - Bullish signal: macd crosses above macds; macdh histogram grows positively; potential price rally confirmation when accompanied by rising volume (VWMA).
  - Bearish signal: macd crosses below macds; macdh histogram turns negative; price action below the 50 SMA adds conviction.
  - Divergences: If price makes a new high but macd/macds/macdh fail to, or if price makes a new low while MACD components don’t, be cautious about trending reversals.
- close_10_ema
  - Bullish: Price closes above 10 EMA or a tight pullback bounce from 10 EMA back above price, especially with price above 50 SMA and VWMA confirmation.
  - Bearish: Price breaks below 10 EMA, particularly if also below 50 SMA and ATR indicates rising volatility (risk management flag).
- close_50_sma
  - Bullish: Price holds above 50 SMA on multiple time frames; if 10 EMA also above 50 SMA, the short-term momentum aligns with the longer-term trend.
  - Bearish: Price crossing below 50 SMA with MACD/macd signals turning negative suggests potential trend fatigue or reversal risk.
- RSI
  - Overbought (>70) in a strong uptrend can persist; use in combination with MACD and price below/above key moving averages to avoid chasing top.
  - Oversold (<30) in a down move can signal a potential bounce, especially if MACD shows positive momentum recovery and VWMA confirms volume support.
- ATR
  - Rising ATR: Expect wider price swings; adjust stops wider and avoid over-tight risk controls during events.
  - Falling ATR: Quieter price action; tighter stops may be reasonable if other signals align.
- VWMA
  - Price above VWMA with rising volume strengthens a bullish thesis; price below VWMA with weak volume supports a bearish or consolidating view.
  - Divergences between price and VWMA can indicate weakening trend momentum.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed trend report for TSLA using the 8 indicators above, including:
  - Current values and recent trend signals (e.g., MACD cross, RSI level, price relation to 10 EMA and 50 SMA, ATR readings, VWMA status).
  - Short-term to mid-term directional view (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) with associated confidence.
  - Potential entry/exit zones, stop-loss placements guided by ATR, and risk-management notes.
  - A summarized risk/volatility outlook to help position sizing.

Next steps (two options)
- Option A: I retry data retrieval now and then run the 8-indicator analysis for TSLA, delivering a full trend report with numbers and interpretations.
- Option B: You provide a date range or a manual data CSV you can share, and I’ll compute the indicators from that data.

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and signals
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | Signals to watch | Ideal timeframe | Why it complements TSLA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via MACD line vs signal | MACD cross above/below signal; positive/negative divergences | Daily/4H | Core momentum signal; combines with price trend for better entries/exits |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line dynamics | Crossovers with MACD line; momentum shift indication | Daily/4H | Early confirmation of MACD-driven moves; reduces false positives when used with macd/histogram |
| macdh | MACD Related | MACD histogram momentum strength | Histogram expanding/contracting; divergences | Daily/4H | Visual momentum strength; helps time entries when MACD signals are ambiguous |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term trend/momentum | Price crossing above/below 10 EMA; pullbacks to 10 EMA | 4H/Daily | Quick momentum gauging; useful for swing entries and stop placement synergy with longer MA |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction | Price above/below 50 SMA; crossovers with price | Daily/4H | Trend filter; confirms alignment with longer-term sentiment |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Relative momentum/magnitude | >70 overbought, <30 oversold; potential divergences | Daily/4H | Signals potential reversals/continuations within trend context; avoid over-reliance in strong trends |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility / price range | Rising ATR; wider stops; volatility-driven risk management | Daily/4H | Risk control and position sizing guide; helps set stops appropriately |
| vwma | Volume-Based Indicators | Volume-adjusted trend confirmation | Price action with VWMA crossover/consistent above/below VWMA | Daily/4H | Confirms moves with volume; reduces false signals from price movement alone |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and provide the full TSLA indicator readings and a detailed trend report as soon as the data tool comes back online. Just say “retry TSLA data” and I’ll run again and deliver the live analysis.
