I tried to fetch QQQ data with the provided tool, but the request returned a FileNotFoundError from the environment (the CSV/backend needed to compute indicators isn’t accessible right now). I’ll proceed by proposing a robust indicator setup for QQQ (the Nasdaq-100 ETF) and provide a detailed framework you can apply once data access is restored. This will include up to 8 complementary indicators with concise rationale and a clear usage guide.

Recommended indicator set for QQQ (diverse, non-redundant, up to 8 indicators)
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: A responsive short-term average that tracks recent price momentum.
  - How to use on QQQ: Look for quick shifts in momentum; use in conjunction with longer-term averages to filter false entries in a tech-heavy, often choppy market.

- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use on QQQ: Use to identify ongoing trend direction; crossovers with the 10-EMA or 200-SMA can help confirm entries or risk-off moments.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark; trend alignment/major regime shifts.
  - How to use on QQQ: Use as a macro trend filter. A price above the 200-SMA suggests a long-term uptrend; a cross below signals potential trend deceleration or reversal.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences between short and long EMAs.
  - How to use on QQQ: Watch for MACD line cross above/below the signal line as a momentum-change signal. Confirm with price action and the trend context from the moving averages.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: The EMA of the MACD line; smoothing to reduce noise.
  - How to use on QQQ: Use MACD vs MACDS crossovers to trigger or filter signals from MACD. A MACDS crossover with MACD bullish signal adds confidence.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: Momentum strength (gap between MACD and its signal).
  - How to use on QQQ: Positive histogram indicates bullish momentum; growing positive bars reinforce uptrends, while shrinking or negative bars warn of weakening momentum or possible reversal.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: Relative momentum indicating overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use on QQQ: Look for divergences with price, or overbought/oversold readings to anticipate reversals. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay high for extended periods; use trend filters (50/200-SMA) to avoid premature exits.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it measures: Volatility magnitude (range-based) over a period.
  - How to use on QQQ: Use to set position sizing and stop levels; rising ATR implies wider price swings and adjusts risk management accordingly. Can help avoid tight stops in volatile tech rallies/drawdowns.

Rationale for the mix
- The three moving averages provide a layered view of trend strength and regime (short, medium, long term).
- The MACD family (macd, macds, macdh) gives momentum signals from multiple angles (line cross, smoothed signal, and histogram strength) to reduce false positives in a market known for whipsaws.
- RSI adds a momentum-based overbought/oversold perspective and divergence signals, useful for timing near potential reversals within a broader trend.
- ATR introduces a volatility-aware risk management lens, critical for QQQ’s mode-shifts (growth-led rallies vs. risk-off rotations).

Detailed, nuanced interpretation framework (without relying on current data)
- In a sustained uptrend (price above 200-SMA and 50-SMA rising):
  - Expect 10-EMA to stay above 50-SMA; macd bullish signal corroborated by rising macdh histogram.
  - RSI may hover in a high range but should not frequently hit extreme overbought conditions unless accompanied by constructive price action.
  - ATR rising would indicate healthy participation and willingness of the market to expand moves; use wider stops but maintain discipline with MACD/RSI signals for entries.
- In a choppy/mean-reversion regime:
  - Moving averages may flatten or cross; MACD/histogram may show frequent crossovers; RSI can move between 30 and 70 without clear divergence.
  - Use ATR to gauge lower volatility and tighten risk controls; wait for a clear alignment of MACD momentum with a trend directional signal from the 50/200-SMA before committing to trades.
- In rotation phases (growth tech leadership shifting to other sectors):
  - QQQ can experience whipsaws around key macro events (rate changes, policy shifts). Look for convergences where MACD trend supports price action, RSI aligns with the direction but isn’t overextended, and ATR shows a normalization or contraction before a follow-on move.
- Combining signals for entries/exits:
  - Bullish setup: price above 200-SMA, 50-SMA trending up, 10-EMA above 50-SMA, MACD above signal with increasing macdh, RSI not overbought, ATR not at extreme, price breaking above a nearby resistance or upper Bollinger band if you monitor bands.
  - Bearish setup: price below 200-SMA, 50-SMA turning down, 10-EMA below 50-SMA, MACD below signal with decreasing macdh, RSI failing to make new highs/diverging, ATR rising indicating volatility of a downside move.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can re-run the data fetch as soon as the backend CSV access is available, then generate the indicators and provide an up-to-date trend read using the exact eight indicators above.
- Alternatively, if you want to proceed with a smaller subset (e.g., just moving averages + MACD + RSI) or swap ATR for Bollinger components for a volatility-based perspective, I can tailor the set accordingly.

Note: I’ll re-attempt data retrieval as soon as the backend CSV access is available, and I can deliver a detailed, data-driven report with the eight indicators applied to the latest QQQ data. If you want a different indicator mix in the meantime (e.g., adding Bollinger bands or VWMA), tell me your preference and I’ll adjust.
