Thanks for the signal. I attempted to pull META data with get_YFin_data, but I’m hitting an internal file/CSV issue (FileNotFoundError) in this environment. Until the data CSV is accessible, I can’t run the indicator calculations or produce the detailed trend report you asked for. I can proceed in two ways:

- Retry data fetch here (and then run the indicators once the data loads)
- Or proceed now with a clearly defined indicator plan and the methodology you’ll see once data becomes available

In the meantime, I’ve prepared a concise, complementary indicator set (8 indicators) that will give you a well-rounded view of META from multiple angles once the data is loaded. I’ve explained why each is suitable for META’s market context and how to interpret signals together for better decision-making.

Selected indicators (8 total, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_10_ema
  - What it captures: Short-term momentum and rapid shifts in price action.
  - How to use: Look for price crossing above/below the 10 EMA as early entry/exit hints; filter with longer-term trends to avoid choppy signals.
- close_50_sma
  - What it captures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Use as a trend filter; pullbacks to the 50SMA in uptrends can be potential entry zones if aligned with other signals.
- close_200_sma
  - What it captures: Long-term trend benchmark; broader market context.
  - How to use: Watch for golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) or death cross (opposite) as strategic trend confirmation; helps avoid premature entries in bear markets.
- macd
  - What it captures: Momentum strength and potential trend changes via MACD line vs. signal line.
  - How to use: MACD line cross above/below the Signal line, along with histogram momentum, as confirmation or warning; pair with price action and trend context.
- macds
  - What it captures: MACD signal line dynamics (smoother momentum cue).
  - How to use: Crossovers with MACD line offer more conservative entry/exit signals when combined with other filters.
- rsi
  - What it captures: Momentum consolidation and overbought/oversold pressure.
  - How to use: Look for 70/30 thresholds and potential divergences in conjunction with price trend; in strong trends, RSI can stay extended—use trend filters to avoid false reversals.
- boll
  - What it captures: The Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a dynamic price benchmark and mean reversion context.
  - How to use: Price tests of the middle line can indicate pullbacks in uptrends or rallies in downtrends; confirm with volatility context from ATR and price action around bands if you were to use boll_ub/boll_lb later.
- atr
  - What it captures: Market volatility and true range to inform risk management.
  - How to use: Use to scale stops and position sizing; rising ATR suggests wider stops, tighter risk controls in low-volatility phases.

Rationale for META in this context
- META often exhibits multi-timeframe dynamics (short-term momentum driven by headlines, medium-term trend influenced by ad demand, product roadmap, and AI investments). A blend of fast (close_10_ema), medium (close_50_sma), and long-term (close_200_sma) trend indicators helps you discern whether the stock is in a change-of-state or continuing move.
- MACD and RSI provide momentum and overbought/oversold context for timing within the prevailing trend. They help avoid chasing breakouts in choppy markets.
- Bollinger middle (boll) adds a volatility-agnostic baseline to identify pullbacks against the expected mean, while ATR informs risk controls across current volatility regimes.

Next steps (what I’ll do as soon as data is accessible)
- Re-run the data fetch for META from 2024-10-19 to 2025-10-19 (or any date window you prefer) and compute the 8 indicators listed above.
- Produce a detailed, nuanced trend report with:
  - Trend direction and strength across multiple horizons
  - Momentum cues and potential divergences
  - Volatility and risk management context
  - Potential entry/exit signals framed by multi-indicator confirmation
- Append a Markdown table at the end of the report to summarize key points, interpretations, and signal discipline.

What I need from you
- Permission to retry the data fetch now (the same date range) and then run the 8 indicators as soon as the data CSV is accessible.
- If you prefer, specify a different date window or fewer indicators to start with, and I’ll adjust.

Markdown table: quick reference of the chosen indicators and signals (to be populated with actual outputs after data load)

| Indicator | What it Measures | Signal to Watch | How to Use with META |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10 EMA | Early entries/exits; confirm with longer-term trend filters |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Price/price action vs 50SMA; potential cross with shorter avg | Trend confirmation; pullbacks to 50SMA in uptrends as potential entries |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Golden/death cross with mid-term SMA or price proximity | Strategic trend confirmation; avoid counter-trend bets in bear markets |
| macd | Momentum strength | MACD line vs Signal line cross; histogram changes | Confirm trend changes with price action and other signals |
| macds | MACD signal dynamics | Crossovers with MACD line; diverging histogram | More conservative momentum confirmation |
| rsi | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold | RSI >70 or <30; divergences | Timing within trend; avoid false reversals in strong trends |
| boll | Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) baseline | Price tests/holds around middle line | Baseline for mean-reversion vs breakout context; confirm with price action |
| atr | Volatility/risk context | Rising ATR; compression followed by expansion | Adjust stops and position sizing; manage risk in volatile regimes |

Important note
- The data fetch error is an environment issue, not a market issue. I’ll proceed with the full analysis as soon as the data CSV becomes accessible. If you want me to try a shorter window or a different range to reduce data load, tell me and I’ll adjust immediately.
