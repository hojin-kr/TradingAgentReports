Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock news for GOOGL on 2025-10-19, but I’m hitting a tool error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I’ve tried twice and it’s not coming online in this environment. I can:

- Retry the Reddit data fetch later, or
- Proceed with an alternate approach using other sources (news headlines, general sentiment indicators, etc.) and clearly mark what’s pending Reddit-specific data.

If you’d like, I can start with a robust long-form analysis framework now and fill in the Reddit sentiment once the tool is back. Here’s a detailed plan and a starter framework you can review.

What I will deliver (once Reddit data is available or via alternatives)
- Comprehensive sentiment and news analysis for GOOGL (Alphabet) over the past week
- Fine-grained day-by-day sentiment signals and key narrative themes
- Public sentiment vs. major company news impact and potential implications for traders
- Practical takeaways for different trading horizons (intraday, swing, long-term)
- A concise Markdown table at the end to organize key points

Proposed structure for the long report
1) Executive snapshot
- Quick read on overall sentiment trend (positive/negative/mixed) and potential catalysts
- Snapshot of any obvious sentiment-speed bumps tied to recent news (AI progress, cloud milestones, regulatory notes)

2) Daily sentiment and narrative analysis (past 7 days)
- Day-by-day sentiment polarity (positive/neutral/negative) and confidence
- Top 3 recurring themes each day (e.g., AI capabilities, ad market demand, YouTube monetization, regulatory risk)
- Any notable shifts in tone after specific events (product launches, earnings hints, policy updates)

3) News and event synthesis
- Recent company/news headlines with short summaries
- Per-headline sentiment framing and potential market impact
- Cross-check with social sentiment: do headlines align, diverge, or lag?

4) Core drivers and risk factors
- Artificial intelligence race positioning (Google’s AI infrastructure, product integrations)
- Cloud growth and enterprise adoption signals
- Advertising market dynamics and YouTube monetization signals
- Regulatory environment and antitrust considerations
- Hardware/semiconductors and related partnerships
- Talent, leadership commentary, and strategic shifts

5) Sentiment-to-price interpretation (qualitative)
- How sentiment shifts historically correlate with short-term price moves for large-cap techs like GOOGL
- What to watch for in real-time sentiment vs. price action

6) Trader-oriented implications
- Short-term trading ideas (scalp, swing) if sentiment shows clear inflection points
- Medium/long-term perspective considering AI and regulatory trajectories
- Risk management notes and signals to alert on (sudden sentiment reversals, headline risk)

7) Data caveats and limitations
- Acknowledgment of data gaps (noting Reddit data pending)
- How I normalize sentiment across sources and handle biases

Proposed Markdown table (end of report)
- Date | Daily Sentiment | Top Themes | News Headlines (short) | Price Reaction (if available) | Notes
- Example placeholders will be filled once data comes in

Next steps – how would you like to proceed?
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then compile the full report with Reddit sentiment included.
- Option B: I proceed immediately with a full report using available sources (news headlines, general sentiment proxies) and clearly mark Reddit data as pending.
- Option C: You specify a date window (e.g., last 5 days) and I tailor the analysis to that window.

Tell me which option you prefer, and if you want me to proceed with Option A (retry now) or Option B (alternate sources).
