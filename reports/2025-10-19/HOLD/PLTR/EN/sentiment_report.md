Thanks for the attempt. The Reddit data tool for PLTR returned a FileNotFoundError, which looks like an internal tool issue right now. I can’t fetch the Reddit/news data at the moment. I’ll propose two paths and we can pick one:

Option A — Retry now (preferred if you want live Reddit data)
- I can try the Reddit stock info tool again to pull the latest PLTR posts/news for 2025-10-19 and start building the report from those sources.

Option B — Proceed with a structured analysis framework (no live fetch)
- I’ll outline a detailed, trader-focused analysis framework for PLTR covering social sentiment, daily sentiment deltas, and recent news, plus a plan for how to present an actionable summary. You can provide any data you already have (screenshots, summaries, or pasted text), and I’ll synthesize it into the report.

What I propose to deliver (once we have data, from Reddit and other sources):
- A comprehensive long-form report on PLTR (Palantir) analyzing social media posts, public sentiment, and recent company news over the past week ending 2025-10-19.
- Fine-grained insights rather than generic statements (e.g., “sentiment is mixed”). Identify day-by-day sentiment shifts, dominant topics, and notable news items driving sentiment.
- Trader-oriented implications: potential catalysts, risk factors, and how sentiment interacts with price/volume signals over the week.
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option A right away and retry the Reddit data fetch. If you prefer Option B, I’ll draft the lengkap framework now and await data you provide or permission to continue once the tool is available again.

Please tell me which option you want. If you choose A, I’ll retry the Reddit pull for PLTR on 2025-10-19 and start assembling the report immediately.
