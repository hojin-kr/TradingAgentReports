Recommendation: Buy, but with a disciplined, risk-managed approach that aligns with the provided plan.

Rationale
- The plan emphasizes substantial optionality across multiple Tesla growth rails (auto, energy/storage, software/AI), which could re-rate the stock if milestones land.
- A durable moat (vertical integration, OTA updates, Supercharger network, data flywheel) supports sustained pricing power and margins over time, even if near-term auto margins face pressure.
- Balance sheet strength and scalable capex cadence provide management optionality to hit milestones and monetize non-auto growth streams.

What to implement (risk-managed execution)
- Core positioning: start with a modest core exposure of about 3-7% of equities, with staged increases as catalysts confirm.
- Hedging overlay: implement downside protection (e.g., long puts or a collar) over a portion of the position to cap downside while preserving upside participation.
- Optionality tilt: use long-dated vertical spreads or calendar/diagonal spreads to gain upside exposure with limited upfront cost, rather than buying outright calls.
- Entry sequencing: phase in now; add on strength or upon confirmed catalysts (margin stabilization, AI milestones, energy backlog progress) over the next 4–8 weeks.
- Triggers to scale or trim:
  - Scale up if margins stabilize/improve and AI/robotaxi milestones land on or ahead of schedule.
  - Trim or hedge further if auto margins deteriorate, AI milestones miss, or policy/credit dynamics worsen materially.
- Exit plan: predefined reductions if near-term catalysts disappoint for two consecutive quarters; maintain liquidity to re-enter on meaningful dips if the bull thesis remains plausible.

Key catalysts to monitor
- Auto and energy margin trajectory: signs of margin stabilization with growing energy contribution.
- AI/robotaxi milestones: regulatory clearances, utilization metrics, and any monetization signals.
- Energy storage momentum: project wins, backlog growth, and gross margin stability.
- Macro/policy/competitive shifts: tariff changes, credits volatility, peers’ software/software-as-a-service progress.

Bottom line
- The multi-rail growth and optionality argument justifies a Buy stance, provided you employ a structured risk plan to protect capital and participate in upside as catalysts unfold.
