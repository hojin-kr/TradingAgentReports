I attempted to fetch the Reddit/stock-news data for TSLA on 2025-10-26, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t access the social-media/news data right now through the provided tool. I can either retry the fetch, or proceed with a thorough qualitative framework and a ready-to-fill report template that you can populate once the data comes in.

Here are two options. Pick one (or both, in sequence):

Option A: Retry data fetch now
- I’ll attempt the data pull again and then deliver a full, data-driven long report with sentiment by day, top topics, and recent news, followed by a concise interpretation for traders (risk, opportunities, and caveats).
- Pros: Most accurate, up-to-date view combining Reddit sentiment, other social sources, and news.
- Cons: Dependent on tool availability; could fail again.

Option B: Proceed with a qualitative framework and a ready-to-fill template
- I’ll deliver a comprehensive methodology, what to monitor, key drivers, and a structured report template, including a Makrdown table at the end to organize key points. You or I can fill in the actual sentiment data once the data fetch works.
- Pros: You have a clear, actionable plan now; ready to insert data quickly when available.
- Cons: No actual data in this pass.

If you’d like, I can start with Option B right away. Here’s a detailed, trader-focused framework you can use, plus a ready-to-fill Makrdown table at the end.

What I will analyze (once data is available)
- Sentiment by day over the past 7–10 days: overall tone (positive/negative/neutral), notable spikes, and correlation with price moves.
- Top topics and keywords driving sentiment (e.g., deliveries, FSD, profitability, guidance, supply chain, price cuts, new models).
- Social media volume trends: mentions per day, notable surges around headlines or events.
- News sentiment: how recent headlines align with social sentiment (positive, negative, mixed).
- Price/action context: intraday/close-to-close moves, volume, and any divergences between sentiment and price.
- Risk signals and catalysts: regulatory updates, production/delivery milestones, earnings timing, macro factors.

What to monitor (key indicators)
- Daily sentiment score and trajectory (magnitude of change)
- Daily mention volume and abnormality vs. historical baseline
- Net sentiment vs. TSLA price move (correlation and lag if any)
- Dominant topics by day (and their sentiment polarity)
- Any outsized spikes tied to a single news item or post
- Event calendar: upcoming earnings, product milestones, regulatory decisions, supply-chain updates

Interpretation guidelines for traders
- Positive sentiment spike with confirming price breakout could signal momentum; watch for volume confirmation.
- Negative sentiment with rising mention volume and unfavorable headlines may precede a pullback; assess support levels and overall market context.
- Mixed signals (positive sentiment but flat/negative price action) could indicate distribution risk or sentiment fatigue; monitor for a trend reversal pattern.
- Sudden sentiment shifts around specific topics (e.g., production updates) can indicate a change in fundamentals or perception; use topic-level analysis to gauge if the shift is durable.

Draft Makrdown table (to fill after data arrives)
- I’ll append this table at the end of the final report. For now, here’s the structure:

Makrdown table (to be filled)
- Date | Source | Sentiment (Overall) | Daily Mention Volume | Top Topics | Notable Headlines | TSLA Price/Change | Price Momentum Context | Confidence
- 2025-10-20 | Reddit | Positive | 1,234 | Topic A, Topic B | Headline 1; Headline 2 | +2.3% | intraday high vs. open | High
- 2025-10-21 | X (Twitter) | Neutral | 1,010 | Topic C, Topic D | Headline 3 | -0.8% | fade after spike | Medium
- 2025-10-22 | StockTwits | Negative | 900 | Topic E | Headline 4 | -1.5% | near support zone | High
- 2025-10-23 | Reddit | Positive | 1,450 | Topic A, Topic F | Headline 5 | +3.0% | breakout with volume | Medium
- 2025-10-24 | Newswire | Mixed | 700 | Topic G | Headline 6 | +0.5% | muted response | Low
- 2025-10-25 | Reddit | Positive | 1,200 | Topic B, Topic H | Headline 7 | +1.2% | continued momentum | Medium
- 2025-10-26 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD

Next steps
- Tell me which option you prefer. If you want Option A, I’ll retry the data fetch now and deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as it succeeds.
- If you prefer Option B, I’ll produce the complete qualitative analysis plus the ready-to-fill Makrmarkdown table above, and we can populate the data once the tool is available again.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now (Option A) or proceed with the qualitative framework and template (Option B)?
