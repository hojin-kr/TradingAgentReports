I tried to fetch the Reddit stock-info for GOOGL today (2025-10-26), but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the fetch, or we can proceed with an alternative plan. Please tell me which you prefer:

Options
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll attempt again immediately).
- Move forward with a comprehensive analysis using available company news and a structured sentiment framework (without live Reddit data) and clearly label any gaps.

If you’d like me to proceed with the full analysis now (without waiting), here’s how I’ll structure it and what you’ll get:

What I will deliver (once data inputs are available)
- Executive snapshot:
  - Brief summary of Google/Alphabet (GOOGL) fundamentals and context as of 2025-10-26.
  - Key market/sector drivers affecting large-cap tech (AI, cloud, ads, regulatory environment).
- Social sentiment analysis framework (how I’ll analyze sentiment, sources, and what to look for):
  - Sources: Reddit threads, public social posts, general sentiment proxies (e.g., volume of mentions, positivity/negativity ratio), and notable themes.
  - Daily sentiment scoring: a quantified sentiment score per day over the past week, with momently observed spikes and potential catalysts.
  - Thematic analysis: major themes (AI/LLMs, ad revenue outlook, regulatory risk, antitrust concerns, product ecosystem updates, earnings/Guidance).
- News snapshot (last 7 days):
  - Headline-level summary of notable company announcements, partnership/news, regulatory developments, and market reactions.
  - Any earnings-related or product-announcement catalysts and their immediate market impact.
- Sentiment-to-price implications:
  - Short-term read of how sentiment trends align or diverge from price action (e.g., sentiment bullishness vs. stock gap-ups, or fear vs. drawdowns).
  - Potential catalysts and risk factors that traders should watch (AI milestones, capex updates, cloud growth, cap table changes, regulatory actions).
- Core takeaways for traders:
  - Short-term tactical view (1-2 weeks): bullish/bearish bias with caveats.
  - Medium-term considerations (1-3 months): structural drivers and risk factors.
  - Key indicators to monitor going forward (price patterns, sentiment spikes, news events).
- Risk disclosures and caveats:
  - Limitations of sentiment data (noise, manipulation, sampling bias).
  - Dependency on tool availability and data freshness.

Proposed Markdown table (key points, organized for quick skim)
- I will fill this in with real data once retrieved. Here’s the structure you’ll see:

| Topic | Key Insight | Source/Date | Trader Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Social sentiment trend (past 7 days) | e.g., sentiment mostly positive with 1-2 spikes around AI news | Reddit data (tbd) + other sources | Possible short-term upside if price and sentiment align |
| Major news events (last 7 days) | e.g., AI/Cloud announcements, regulatory updates | News feed (tbd) | Identify catalysts and risk windows |
| Price action context | e.g., holding above/below 50-day SMA; intraday volatility | Price data (tbd) | Tactical entry/exit considerations |
| Thematic drivers | AI advances, ad revenue trajectory, cloud growth | Thematic analysis (tbd) | Align trades with durable drivers, avoid noise |
| Risk factors | Regulatory risk, antitrust scrutiny, competitive pressure | Regulatory/industry signals (tbd) | Position sizing and risk controls advised |

What I need from you
- Choose a path: Retry Reddit data now or proceed with the structured analysis first.
- If you prefer the full analysis now, I’ll proceed with the framework above and clearly mark where data is pending. When the Reddit tool returns, I’ll update the report with the latest daily sentiment and themes.

Would you like me to retry fetching Reddit stock data for GOOGL now, or shall I proceed with the full sentiment-and-news analysis using the plan above?
