Based on the proposed investment plan and current risk signals, the justification for a cautious stance on AMD remains compelling. I conclude that a Sell is the appropriate next-step action to manage risk and preserve capital until a clearer AI-growth trajectory and data-center demand confirmation emerge.

Key reasons supporting a Sell/reduce stance
- Near-term catalysts are uncertain: AI mix growth, data-center demand, and margin expansion hinges on execution that may not materialize in the immediate horizon.
- Competitive leadership risk persists: Nvidia remains the dominant AI infra beneficiary, which can cap AMD’s upside even if AMD gains share in select workloads.
- Valuation risk: Elevated multiples imply meaningful downside if AI revenue mix or data-center cycles soften or if guidance disappoints.
- Execution and ecosystem risk: ROCm adoption breadth and software ecosystem traction lag CUDA, creating margin and cash-flow risks in the near term.

Practical course of action (if you currently hold AMD)
- Positioning and sizing: Trim AMD by 40-60% of your current AMD exposure immediately to lock in gains and reduce single-name concentration risk. If you’re more risk-averse, a 30-40% trim is reasonable, with reassessment after Q3 results.
- Reallocation and diversification: Reallocate proceeds into a diversified AI/semis sleeve to capture broader AI demand without single-name risk. Options:
  - Broad semiconductor exposure via an ETF (e.g., SMH or SOXX).
  - A diversified AI infrastructure proxy or cloud/AI beneficiaries with clearer near-term catalysts and solid balance sheets.
- Risk controls and hedging: 
  - Establish explicit stop levels on any remaining AMD position (e.g., trailing stop using a blend of moving averages or ATR-based threshold).
  - Use price alerts at key levels to re-enter if the thesis improves, or to cut losses if downside accelerates.
  - If mandate allows, consider a modest hedge (e.g., puts or a negative-beta tech exposure) to dampen residual risk; otherwise rely on diversification.
- Earnings playbook: Prepare for Q3 with defined scenarios (bullish, base, bearish) and price targets. Use scenario-based targets to guide any re-entry if AI mix guidance proves durable.
- Data hygiene: Maintain a multi-signal approach (price action, macro backdrop, peer commentary, and earnings guidance) and clearly label data-driven vs. scenario-based conclusions.

Learning and process improvement (for future rounds)
- Emphasize pre-earnings scenario planning with explicit risk controls (size, stops, hedges) to avoid overreaction to single data points.
- Use probabilistic thinking: assign likelihoods to bear vs. bull outcomes and compute risk-adjusted targets.
- Ensure robust data sources and fallback plans to prevent decisions from incomplete feeds.

Bottom line
The strongest near-term evidence points to elevated downside risk for AMD and a high multiple that makes the stock vulnerable to disappointment in AI mix, data-center demand, or earnings guidance. While the long-term AI tailwinds remain plausible, the current risk-reward skews to reducing exposure and waiting for clearer confirmation of durable AI-driven cash-flow growth.

If you want, I can tailor exact allocation percentages to your portfolio size and risk tolerance, and align re-entry triggers with your time horizon.
