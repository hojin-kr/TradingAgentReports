Thanks — I tried to fetch the AMD Reddit data for 2025-10-26, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). This isn’t a user input problem, it’s a tool/environment issue on my side.

What I can do next:
- I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch immediately to see if it’s a transient hiccup.
- If the retry still fails, I’ll switch to a fallback plan:
  - Provide a structured long-form AMD sentiment and news analysis using whatever public signals I can access or infer (e.g., recent company news, typical Reddit discussion themes around AMD, and general market context).
  - Deliver a detailed trader-oriented takeaway with granular insights and a Markdown table at the end to organize key points.

Please let me know if you’d like me to:
- Retry the Reddit tool now, or
- Proceed with the fallback plan right away (and I’ll clearly label what data is from tool results vs. qualitative synthesis).
