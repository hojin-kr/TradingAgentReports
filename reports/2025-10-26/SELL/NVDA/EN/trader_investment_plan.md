Recommendation: Sell NVDA now (trim aggressively) and redeploy into a diversified AI-infrastructure sleeve with hedging optionality.

Rationale (why this aligns with the plan and current risk factors)
- Valuation and macro risk: Even with a secular AI tailwind, the stock faces high multiples that can compress quickly if growth or margins underwhelm amid a softer macro backdrop.
- AI capex cyclicality: Near-term hyperscaler/enterprise budgets can swing, increasing downside risk if demand slows before a durable reacceleration.
- Moat durability concerns: CUDA/software lock-in is powerful but not immune to competitive pressure or regulatory/export constraints that could erode pricing power over time.
- Diversification benefits: A diversified AI-infrastructure exposure reduces single-name concentration risk while maintaining exposure to the broader AI thesis.

Concrete execution steps
1) Trim NVDA immediately
- Action: Sell or reduce by 50% of your NVDA holding today. If you prefer a staged approach, do 25% now and 25% on a defined pullback or trigger.

2) Redeploy proceeds into a diversified AI-infrastructure sleeve
- Allocation framework (example, adjust to your size and risk tolerance):
  - 45-50% to a broad AI/infrastructure basket ( diversified ETF or a curated basket of AI infra hardware, software tooling, and adjacent growth names)
  - 25-30% to cloud/computing equities with complementary growth profiles (hyperscalers or near peers with balanced valuations)
  - 15-20% to cash or cash equivalents for optionality and liquidity
  - (Optional) 0-5% to a hedging sleeve if you want to retain limited NVDA upside while protecting downside

3) Consider hedging the remaining NVDA exposure (if you choose to stay lightly involved)
- Strategies: protective puts or a collar
  - Protective put: buy puts with several months of duration and a strike 10-15% below the post-trim price.
  - Collar: long put (protective) with a short call at a higher strike to finance the hedge.
- Note: Hedging costs reduce upside but guard against abrupt drops. Tailor strikes/dates to your risk tolerance.

4) Risk controls and exit discipline
- Implement a trailing stop on any remaining NVDA position (e.g., 1.5x ATR below the highest price since entry or a fixed 10-15% below the last peak, whichever you prefer).
- Set a quarterly review cadence to reassess macro AI capex signals, NVDA quarterly results, and the eight-signal framework before re-entry or further trim.

5) Monitoring and data integration
- If possible, re-run a data-backed NVDA read (eight-indicator framework) when data access resumes to inform any potential reload or further adjustments.

Bottom line
- The plan’s strongest near-term argument centers on downside risk from macro softness, potential multiple compression, and concerns about moat durability under pressure. A disciplined trim, followed by diversification into an AI-infrastructure sleeve with optional hedging, aims to preserve long-term AI exposure while mitigating near-term drawdowns.

Would you like me to proceed with a concrete, data-backed NVDA read for today once data feeds are available, or implement the interim sell-and-diversify framework described above?
