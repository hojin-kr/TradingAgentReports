 verdict: Hold NFLX now. Do not chase a full entry. Be ready to add only on clearly defined bullish confirmations.

Rationale (aligned with the provided plan and current risk profile)
- Bear case remains material: saturation in core markets, ARPU sensitivity, ad-cycle headwinds, content-cost pressure, and valuation risk. These factors justify a cautious stance.
- Technicals suggest caution: recent action under the 200-day moving average indicates momentum risk until a durable rebound is seen.
- Bull case components exist but hinge on multiple catalysts (ads ramp, sustained ARPU uplift across regions, margin normalization, and successful monetization levers). Until those prove durable, a Hold protects downside while preserving optionality.
- The recommended path is to wait for robust confirmations before meaningful sizing, consistent with the plan’s risk controls.

Current posture and risk controls (for an existing holder)
- Exposure: keep NFLX at a conservative, portfolio-wide cap (e.g., 1–2% of equity). 
- Stops: implement an ATR-based or price-based stop near key moving averages (e.g., around the 200-day MA or a defined % below cost) and adjust as volatility shifts.
- Optional hedging: collar strategy can be used if you’re uncomfortable with outright exposure.

Triggers to upgrade from Hold to Buy (entry sequencing)
- Only add meaningfully if all align:
  - Price action: closes above the 50-day moving average and above the 10-day EMA.
  - Momentum confirmations: MACD bullish cross and RSI rising into the 55–65 range.
  - Trend confirmation: price sustains above key moving averages for 2–3 weeks, tests the upper Bollinger Band with favorable volume.
  - Fundamentals: early signs of sustainable ARPU growth from ads and a path toward margin normalization with improving free cash flow.
- If these conditions occur, implement incremental buys in 2–3 tranches to avoid over-concentration on early signals.

What to watch for (data and signals)
- Ad-market indicators: improving take-rate, efficient targeting, stable CPMs.
- Subscriber/ARPU trajectories: international subs growth coupled with ARPU uplift.
- Margin/FCF trajectory: stabilization of content costs and improving free cash flow in line with guidance.
- Risks: new regulatory/tax headwinds, content-cost pressure, or adverse competitive dynamics.

Time horizon and review cadence
- Time frame: 6–12 months to form a more confident buy case if catalysts materialize.
- Review cadence: monthly NFLX-specific review; re-evaluate on major earnings/guidance updates or macro shifts in ad spend/FX.

Lessons applied
- Avoid lurching on one-off events; emphasize durable, multi-driver catalysts.
- Favor confirmations over hope; require a confluence of technical and fundamental signals before increasing exposure.
- Maintain risk discipline with conditional sizing and clear stop levels.

Practical next steps
- If you’re already long: hold, tighten risk controls, and monitor for bullish confirmation triggers. Consider a staged add only if the upgrades above occur.
- If you’re not yet long: wait for the defined bullish trigger before initiating. If you do start, keep sizing conservative until sustained confirmation.

Bottom line
- Given the credibility of bear risks and the absence of durable bullish confirmations yet, the prudent course is Hold. Add only on clearly defined bullish catalysts that improve risk-reward dynamics, per the plan’s framework.
