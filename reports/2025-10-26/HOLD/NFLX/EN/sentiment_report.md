Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock data for NFLX on 2025-10-26, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like there’s an internal path/config issue with the get_reddit_stock_info tool right now. I can retry, but in the meantime I can still move the analysis forward in a robust way and provide a structured report framework you can use once the data fetch is working again.

What I can deliver now
- A comprehensive framework for the NFLX sentiment/news analysis, including how to interpret Reddit sentiment, what to look for in daily signals, and how to translate those signals into trading implications.
- A ready-to-fill template with clear data points to capture once the Reddit tool is up again.
- A final Markdown table at the end to organize key points, ready to populate with actual data.

Recommendation on next steps
- Retry data retrieval for NFLX Reddit sentiment and news today (2025-10-26). If the tool continues to fail, I can:
  - Rely on alternative sources you approve (e.g., traditional news headlines, other social platforms) if you grant access, or
  - Produce a high-quality qualitative analysis now while clearly labeling that Reddit data is pending and will be updated as soon as the tool is available.

Draft long-report structure (to be filled with actual data once Reddit feed is retrieved)
1) Executive snapshot
- Objective: Summarize current sentiment state for NFLX based on social chatter and recent news.
- Key questions: Is sentiment skewed positive or negative? Are there any clear catalysts driving sentiment (new content, earnings, pricing, competition, platform changes)?

2) Data sources and methodology
- Reddit: Target subreddits (e.g., r/investing, r/stockmarket, r/Netflix, etc.), time window (past 7 days), sentiment scoring approach (lexicon-based, ML-based, volume-normalized scores).
- News: Major earnings releases, product/strategy announcements, regulatory or macro shifts affecting streaming.
- Sentiment metrics to capture daily:
  - Volume of NFLX mentions
  - Average sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Top themes driving sentiment (e.g., content slate, pricing changes, ad-supported tier, subscriber trends)
  - Z-score relative to overall market or to NFLX’s own baseline

3) Daily sentiment narrative (placeholder until data is filled)
- Day -7 to Day 0: Summary of sentiment trend, notable spikes, and themes
- Notable events driving sentiment (if any): earnings, content deals, platform changes, price moves

4) News and catalysts (recent week)
- Headlines with brief impact assessment
- Any negative catalysts (subscriber misses, competitive pressure) vs. positive catalysts (strong subscriber growth, pricing strategy success, content wins)

5) Sentiment vs price action analysis
- Correlation view: how sentiment spikes or dips align with NFLX price movement
- Lag considerations: whether sentiment changes precede price moves or respond to them

6) Thematic drivers to watch
- Content strategy: new releases, franchises, and subscriber retention
- Pricing and monetization: ad-supported tier adoption, price hikes
- Competitive landscape: Netflix vs. Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, etc.
- Macroe factors: consumer discretionary spending, streaming fatigue, ad market health

7) Risk factors and edge cases
- Sentiment is a leading indicator only if corroborated by price action, volume, and corroborating news
- Potential for sentiment noise around major events (e.g., earnings) that may mislead if not contextualized

8) Trading implications and scenarios
- Bullish scenario: sentiment-positive catalysts align with price strength; consider size-adjusted long exposure or catching breakouts with tight risk controls
- Bearish scenario: persistent negative sentiment with bearish news flow; consider hedging or cautious stance
- Neutral scenario: wait for clearer directional signals and confirm via price action or alternative data sources

9) Monitoring plan and next steps
- Daily routine for refreshing sentiment data
- Key levels to watch on NFLX price (support/resistance, recent highs/lows)
- What would trigger a re-evaluation of stance (e.g., sentiment cross certain thresholds, major news)

10) Appendix: data quality notes
- Data gaps, confidence levels, and adjustments for bot activity or rumor amplification

Proposed data table to fill (ready for the Markdown table at the end)
- Date
- Source (Reddit, News, Other)
- Mentions
- Sentiment (score and label: Positive/Neutral/Negative)
- Top themes
- Notable events
- Price action (intraday change, close)
- Implied trading signal (Bullish/Neutral/Bearish)
- Confidence / notes

Markdown table to append at the end (structure only)
- You can paste actual data once the Reddit tool returns results

| Date       | Source   | Mentions | Sentiment (score, label) | Top Themes | Notable Events | Price Action (intraday/close) | Trading Signal | Confidence / Notes |

Next actions I can take now
- Retry the Reddit data fetch for NFLX (current date 2025-10-26). If it succeeds, I will convert the data into a detailed, trader-focused narrative and fill in the sections above with precise daily sentiment figures, themes, and price correlations, followed by a finalized Markdown table.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a high-quality qualitative draft using typical sentiment patterns seen in Netflix-related discussions (clearly labeled as placeholders until the Reddit data is retrieved), then replace placeholders with actual numbers once the tool is functioning again.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the qualitative draft and rely on later data fill-in?
