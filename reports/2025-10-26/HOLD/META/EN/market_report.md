I tried to fetch META data but hit a FileNotFoundError from the data source. I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with a robust indicator setup and a detailed analysis framework you can use once the data is available. Below I’ve laid out a strong, non-redundant 8-indicator suite along with rationale and how I’ll report trends once the CSV/Data is retrieved.

Recommended 8-indicator setup for META
- close_50_sma (50-period Simple Moving Average)
- close_200_sma (200-period Simple Moving Average)
- close_10_ema (10-period Exponential Moving Average)
- macd (MACD line)
- macds (MACD Signal line)
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
- atr (Average True Range)

Why these eight
- Trend clarity and validation: close_50_sma and close_200_sma give you a clear view of medium- and long-term trend direction. The 50/200 dynamic relationship helps identify potential golden/death-cross setups and overall regime.
- Timely momentum signals: close_10_ema captures quicker shifts in price action, useful for identifying early momentum changes when combined with longer-horizon trends.
- MACD family for momentum and crossovers: macd, macds, and macdh together provide:
  - MACD line crossings for potential entry/exit points
  - Signal line interactions to filter raw MACD signals
  - Histogram strength/divergence to gauge momentum intensity and potential reversals
- Momentum strength and potential reversals: RSI flags overbought/oversold zones and can diverge from price, signaling reversals when aligned with trend context.
- Volatility/risk context: ATR adds a practical measure of current volatility to help with stop placement and position sizing, critical in volatile tech stocks like META.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced trend report that goes beyond “signals are up/down.” Expect:
  - Trend regime assessment: Is META in a bullish, bearish, or range-bound regime based on 50/200 SMA relationship and price interaction with major SMA levels?
  - Momentum anatomy: How MACD lines, signal, and histogram are behaving (crossovers, histogram slopes, and divergence with price) to indicate strength and potential inflection points.
  - Short-term vs long-term alignment: Do the 10-EMA signals corroborate or contradict the longer SMA-based trend? Is there confirmation from RSI (momentum with respect to the trend) or potential RSI divergence?
  - Volatility and risk knobs: How ATR is changing, suggesting adjustments to stop loss bands and position sizing.
  - Support/resistance context: Not just where price is, but where dynamic floors/ceilings lie relative to the SMAs and MACD/RSI signals.
  - Scenario-based guidance: What to do if price breaks above/below critical SMA levels or if MACD/histogram shows weakening momentum with RSI overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Entry/exit heuristics: Conditions under which entries are aligned with both trend and momentum, and when to tighten exits or reduce exposure in high-volatility regimes.

Next steps
- Option A: I retry fetching META data now and then generate a full indicators report with the 8-indicator setup and the detailed trend analysis.
- Option B: If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, non-data-driven framework (interpretive guidance) using the same indicator setup so you’re ready to act once data comes in.

Markdown table: Key indicators and what they reveal
- Indicator | Category | Purpose / What to look for
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation and potential golden/death cross signals
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts; may precede broader trend change
- macd | MACD Related | Primary momentum signal; trend change potential via MACD line
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line for crossovers with MACD line
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergence via histogram
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold levels; divergence hints of reversals
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Current volatility level; informs stop placement and risk management

Important note: Once I recover the data, I’ll attach a detailed, fine-grained report that includes:
- Current trend classification (bullish, bearish, or range)
- Key support/resistance zones around the 50/200 SMAs and recent swing lows/highs
- MACD/RSI divergence checks and momentum strength
- Volatility regime and recommended risk controls using ATR
- A concise set of actionable entry/exit ideas tailored to META’s price action and typical range dynamics

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now and generate the full indicators report with these eight indicators, or would you prefer I proceed with the qualitative framework in the meantime?
