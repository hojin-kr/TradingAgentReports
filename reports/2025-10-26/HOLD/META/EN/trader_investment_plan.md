Recommendation: Hold META right now.

Rationale (based on the provided plan and current context)
- AI monetization: The thesis remains plausible but not proven enough to justify unhedged bullish exposure. ROI signals are still uncertain, and upside may be episodic rather than durable in the near term.
- Regulatory risk: Ongoing data-access, consent, and cross-border compliance concerns can cap monetization velocity and raise costs, creating a floor on near-term earnings momentum.
- Ad-demand environment: Macro ad-cycle weakness and potential ad-market softness can dampen topline growth, making AI-driven efficiency gains less impactful on margins in the near term.
- Capital allocation: Metaverse and other non-core spends may continue to weigh on optics and cash flow in the near term, signaling a cautious stance until ROI milestones are credibly demonstrated.

Path to upgrading to Buy (conditional)
- If within the next 2–4 quarters META delivers durable, attributable ROAS uplift and ARPU growth tied specifically to AI-enabled campaigns, with clear margin expansion (operating margin improving and price/incremental gross margin improving), consider increasing exposure toward Buy.
- Conversely, if AI ROI proves episodic, regulatory headwinds intensify, or ad-cycle demand weakens meaningfully, we should tighten risk controls or reduce exposure.

Operational guidance (aligned with the plan)
- Maintain META as a core holding but implement hedging around catalysts to protect downside while preserving optionality for upside if ROI milestones land.
- Use a KPI-driven monitoring framework focused on: ROAS uplift by advertiser cohort, ARPU per user, AI-enabled format adoption with revenue impact, gross/operating margin trends, and regulatory indicators (data access/consent changes and penalties).
- Establish quarterly reviews. If ROAS/ARPU improvements prove durable and margins show early signs of expansion, reassess toward a more constructive stance; if not, trim risk exposure accordingly.
- Prepare for catalysts with a neutral-to-slightly-positive posture and deploy event-driven hedges to monetize potential upside while protecting against downside surprises.

Final note
- The decision reflects a disciplined stance that prioritizes observable ROI signals and regulatory clarity before committing to a more bullish stance. If data lands in a clearer bull-path with credible, repeatable ROI signals, I will adjust to Buy with higher conviction.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
