Sorry — I hit an issue pulling the Reddit sentiment data for META. The parallel tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError, and a direct call to get_reddit_stock_info also failed with the same error. I can retry the data pull, or switch to another data source if you have one. In the meantime, here’s how I propose we proceed and what I can deliver right away.

What I can deliver now
- A structured plan for the full META sentiment/news report, ready to fill as soon as the sentiment data comes back.
- A think-piece-style synthesis highlighting the likely drivers and implications for traders, based on the typical themes around META (ads revenue environment, AI integration, cost management, metaverse strategy, regulatory landscape, competition) without speculating on exact sentiment numbers.
- A ready-to-use Markdown table template at the end, to organize the key takeaways once we have the data.

Recommended next steps
- Retry data pull for META sentiment from 2025-10-21 to 2025-10-26 (daily breakdown). If the tool remains unavailable, I can switch to a manual synthesis using other sources you approve (e.g., other social platforms or public news summaries).
- If you prefer, I can proceed now with a comprehensive qualitative draft and clearly mark where sentiment numbers will go when data returns.

Draft outline of the long report (to be filled with actual sentiment data)
- Executive snapshot (one-paragraph gist of the week)
- Social sentiment overview
  - Daily sentiment trend (META over 2025-10-21 to 2025-10-26)
  - Top recurring themes by day (e.g., ad platform changes, AI features, privacy/regulatory topics, user engagement)

- Company news highlights (past week)
  - Earnings/guidance (if any)
  - Product/feature announcements or updates
  - Regulatory or legal developments

Would you like me to retry pulling the Reddit sentiment data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the qualitative draft in parallel and I fill in the sentiment fields as soon as the data tool returns? If you have an alternative data source you'd like me to use for sentiment (e.g., a different social platform feed or a CSV you provide), I can switch to that immediately.
