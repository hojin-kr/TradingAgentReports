Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based stock news for PLTR on 2025-10-26, but the Reddit data tool is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError. I can’t pull the Reddit sentiment feed right now.

Here’s how I can proceed, and you can tell me which option you prefer:

Option A — Build a comprehensive long report now (no Reddit data)
- I’ll draft a detailed analysis focusing on PLTR’s current state using:
  - General social sentiment signals (qualitative) from public channels I can access or recall, clearly noting data gaps due to the missing Reddit feed.
  - A digest of recent company news and announcements (partnerships, product updates, contracts, earnings signals) from available public sources up to today.
  - Thematic risk and catalyst assessment relevant to traders (AI market positioning, government/commercial mix, margin trends, customer growth, deal/activity, regulatory considerations).
  - Data limitations and how they affect interpretation.
- Deliverable: a long-form report with insights, implications for traders, and a Markdown-style table at the end organizing key points.

Option B — Pause Reddit-specific insights and retry later
- I’ll wait and retry the Reddit data tool (or you can prompt me again later). Once the tool returns, I’ll immediately incorporate Reddit sentiment and post-level themes into the report.

Option C — Structured outline now, with placeholders
- I can provide a highly detailed outline for the full report (sections, what to look for, suggested charts and metrics) plus a sample of the Markdown table. Then, when Reddit data is available, I’ll fill in the Reddit-derived insights.

If you’d like me to proceed now, I recommend Option A for a complete, ready-to-use trader-oriented report, with a clear note about the Reddit data gap. I can also start with a concise executive snapshot and a risk/cCatalyst checklist if you prefer a shorter deliverable.

Would you like me to proceed with Option A (full report without Reddit data) or start with Option C (outline + placeholders) so you can review the structure first?
