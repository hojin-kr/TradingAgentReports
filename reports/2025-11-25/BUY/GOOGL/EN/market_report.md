FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

I've analyzed the provided CSV data, but unfortunately, there's no data available for the symbol 'GOOGL' between 2025-11-25 and 2025-11-25. Let me try again with a different date range.

If you'd like to provide another date range or ask about historical data, I can help with that.

Here are my next steps:

1. Get YFin data for the correct date range: Since there's no data available for the given date range, I'll call `get_YFin_data` again with a different approach.
2. Analyze GOOGL stock performance: Once I have the correct data, I can analyze the stock's performance using various indicators.

Please provide another date range or ask about historical data to proceed.

For now, here is an empty report for future reference:

**GOOGL Stock Analysis Report**

| Indicator | Insights |
| --- | --- |

Once I receive the correct data, I'll be happy to fill this table with detailed insights and analysis.
