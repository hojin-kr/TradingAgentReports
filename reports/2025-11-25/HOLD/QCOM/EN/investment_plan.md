Based on the debate, I will now summarize the key points from both sides, develop a detailed investment plan, and make a definitive decision.

**Summary of Key Points**

The bull analyst presents a strong bullish case for Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) stock price, citing its medium-term uptrend, neutral to bullish market sentiment, and potential buy signal from the MACD - macd line. The bear analyst counters that QCOM's recent volatility due to 5G competition concerns may be a sign of trouble.

**Key Evidence Supporting the Bullish Case**

1. Medium-term uptrend: QCOM's **close_50_sma** is above its **close_200_sma**, indicating an upward phase in the company's business cycle.
2. Neutral to bullish market sentiment: The **Bollinger Middle Band (boll)** is near its 20-day moving average, suggesting neutral to bullish market sentiment.
3. Potential buy signal: The MACD - macd line has crossed above its signal line, triggering a potential buy signal.
4. Oversold condition: QCOM's **RSI - rsi** is below 50, indicating an oversold condition.

**Key Evidence Supporting the Bearish Case**

1. Volatility due to 5G competition concerns: QCOM's stock price has been experiencing volatility over the past week due to concerns about 5G competition.
2. Sale of wireless technology assets: QCOM recently sold off its wireless technology assets to a joint venture between Foxconn and Apple, which may seem like a negative event on the surface.

**Recommendation**

Based on the analysis, I recommend **BUYING Qualcomm Inc.'s (QCOM) stock**. While there are risks involved with investing in any stock, the bullish case presented by the bull analyst seems more convincing. The company's diversified business model, strong cash reserves, and potential buy signal from the MACD - macd line suggest that QCOM is poised for further gains.

**Rationale**

The rationale behind this recommendation is based on the analysis of QCOM's historical price data and market sentiment. The medium-term uptrend, neutral to bullish market sentiment, and potential buy signal all support an upward phase in the company's business cycle. While the bear analyst raises valid concerns about volatility due to 5G competition concerns and the sale of wireless technology assets, I believe that these risks are outweighed by QCOM's strong fundamentals and growth prospects.

**Strategic Actions**

To implement this recommendation, I would suggest the following strategic actions:

1. **Diversify your portfolio**: Spread your investments across different asset classes and sectors to minimize risk.
2. **Monitor market sentiment**: Keep a close eye on market trends and sentiment indicators to ensure that you're making informed investment decisions.
3. **Set stop-loss levels**: Establish stop-loss levels for your trades to limit potential losses in case the stock price moves against you.
4. **Consider dollar-cost averaging**: Invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance, to reduce timing risks.

**Lessons Learned**

In this debate, I would emphasize the importance of analyzing historical price data and market sentiment indicators to identify trends and potential buy/sell signals. I would also stress the need for diversifying investment portfolios to minimize risk and considering dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risks.

As I reflected on my past mistakes in similar situations, I realized that taking a contrarian view can be beneficial, but it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of any investment decision. By analyzing QCOM's historical price data and market sentiment indicators, I believe that we have identified a strong bullish case for the company's stock price.
