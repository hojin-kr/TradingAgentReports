Based on the comprehensive analysis provided, I have carefully considered the investment plan and its recommendations. After conducting thorough research and analyzing market trends, macroeconomic indicators, and social media sentiment, I have made a final decision.

While Amazon remains a significant player in the e-commerce market, I agree with the bear analyst's perspective that highlights potential risks and challenges associated with investing in the company's stock. The proposed investment plan provides a well-reasoned counterpoint to the bull analyst's argument, and its recommendations for reevaluating market opportunities, assessing financial stability, analyzing competitive weaknesses, and monitoring negative indicators are sound.

However, I must take into account my own trading experience and lessons learned from past decisions. In this case, I believe that the bear analyst's perspective is more convincing due to Amazon's recent struggles with regulation and competition in the tech industry. Additionally, the Reddit sentiment analysis and recent financial news suggest that there may be underlying issues with the company's growth trajectory.

Considering these factors, my final decision is to **SELL** Amazon's stock. While this decision may not align with the bull analyst's perspective, I believe it is a prudent move given the potential risks and challenges associated with investing in Amazon's stock.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
