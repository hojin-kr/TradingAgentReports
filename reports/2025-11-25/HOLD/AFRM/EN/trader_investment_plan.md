Based on the comprehensive analysis provided by the team of analysts, I have carefully evaluated the pros and cons of investing in AFRM and have come to a well-reasoned conclusion.

The proposed investment plan recommends a Sell stance on AFRM due to its reliance on cost-cutting measures, limited resources, and scalability concerns. While the company's commitment to sustainable energy solutions is admirable, these benefits are outweighed by the significant challenges facing the organization.

In light of this analysis, I concur with the bear analyst's assessment that AFRM faces substantial obstacles to achieving long-term growth and profitability. The stock's reliance on cost-cutting measures and restructuring efforts raises concerns about its ability to drive meaningful growth in the future.

Considering these factors, my recommendation is to Sell all shares of AFRM at the next available trading opportunity. This decision will help limit potential losses and avoid further exposure to a stock that may not have the long-term growth prospects initially assumed.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
