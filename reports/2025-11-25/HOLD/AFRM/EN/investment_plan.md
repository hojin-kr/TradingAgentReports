After carefully evaluating both sides of the debate, I'm going to align with the bear analyst's stance. While the bull analyst presents some compelling arguments about AFRM's partnership with a renewable energy firm and its commitment to sustainable energy solutions, I believe that their enthusiasm is misplaced and that the company faces significant challenges.

The key takeaway from the debate is that AFRM's reliance on cost-cutting measures and restructuring efforts undermines its long-term sustainability. This lack of diversification and reliance on cost-cutting measures raises concerns about the company's ability to drive meaningful growth and profitability in the long term.

Furthermore, I agree with the bear analyst's assessment that the growing demand for renewable energy is not as uniform across all regions and industries as assumed. The feasibility and scalability of certain renewable energy technologies, particularly in areas with limited resources or high costs, are significant concerns that need to be addressed.

While AFRM's solid financials and increasing revenue streams may seem impressive at first glance, they do not necessarily translate into long-term growth or profitability. In fact, many established companies have demonstrated that they can maintain high levels of earnings while struggling with declining market share and revenue.

In light of these concerns, I recommend a Sell stance on AFRM. While the company's commitment to sustainable energy solutions is admirable, its reliance on cost-cutting measures and restructuring efforts raises significant red flags about its long-term viability.

**Detailed Investment Plan:**

1. **Stop-loss order:** Set a stop-loss order at 50% below the current market price to limit potential losses in case the stock declines further.
2. **Sell:** Sell all shares of AFRM at the next available trading opportunity, ideally when the stock has reached its lowest point before recovering or showing signs of stabilization.
3. **Alternative investment options:** Consider alternative investment options that align with your risk tolerance and financial goals, such as index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on sustainable energy solutions.

**Rationale:**

My recommendation to Sell AFRM is based on the bear analyst's well-reasoned arguments about the company's reliance on cost-cutting measures, limited resources, and scalability concerns. While the bull analyst presents some compelling points about AFRM's partnership with a renewable energy firm and its commitment to sustainable energy solutions, I believe that these benefits are outweighed by the significant challenges facing the company.

By taking a Sell stance on AFRM, we can limit potential losses and avoid further exposure to a stock that may not have the long-term growth prospects the bull analyst assumes. This decision will require discipline and patience, but ultimately, it's essential to prioritize prudence over optimism in our investment decisions.

**Strategic Actions:**

1. **Monitor AFRM's financial performance:** Keep a close eye on AFRM's quarterly earnings reports and financial statements to track its progress on reducing costs and increasing revenue.
2. **Re-evaluate portfolio allocation:** Review your overall portfolio allocation and consider rebalancing it to minimize exposure to high-risk assets like AFRM.
3. **Explore alternative investment opportunities:** Consider investing in sustainable energy-focused ETFs or index funds that align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

By taking a Sell stance on AFRM, we can protect our capital from potential losses while keeping an eye on the company's progress and considering alternative investment options that may offer more attractive returns.
