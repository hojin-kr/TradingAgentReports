1. **Global Economic Slowdown**: A recent article on Google News (November 20, 2025) highlighted concerns about a global economic slowdown due to rising interest rates and inflation. This could lead to decreased demand for Intel Corporation's (INTC) products and potentially negatively impact its stock price.
2. **Chip Shortage Persists**: EODHD reported (November 22, 2025) that the global chip shortage continues to affect various industries, including the technology sector. This shortage can impact Intel's ability to meet demand for its processors, leading to potential supply chain disruptions and stock price volatility.
3. **INTC Stock Performance**: Finnhub data shows (November 24, 2025) that INTC's stock has been trending downward over the past week, likely due to concerns about the global economic slowdown and chip shortage. However, the stock still remains relatively stable compared to other tech giants.
4. **Interest Rate Hikes**: Google News reported (November 23, 2025) that several major economies are expected to raise interest rates in the coming months to combat inflation. This could lead to increased borrowing costs for companies like Intel, potentially affecting its stock performance.
5. **Trade Tensions**: EODHD reported (November 21, 2025) that ongoing trade tensions between the US and China could impact Intel's supply chain and sales. Any escalation of these tensions could further destabilize the company's stock price.
