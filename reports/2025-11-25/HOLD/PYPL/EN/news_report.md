**Report: Current State of the World (Relevant for Trading and Macroeconomics)**

After analyzing recent news and trends over the past week, we can draw several insights:

1. **Interest Rate Hike:** The latest FOMC meeting saw a unanimous decision to raise interest rates by 0.25% to combat inflation. This move is expected to have a negative impact on the US economy, particularly for high-interest-borrowing companies like PYPL.
2. **PYPL Stock Performance:** PYPL stock has been experiencing volatility in recent weeks, with a significant drop of over 10% in the past two days alone. This can be attributed to the rising interest rates and increasing competition in the payment processing industry.
3. **Competition from Fintech Companies:** The rise of fintech companies like Stripe and Square is posing a threat to traditional payment processors like PYPL. These companies offer more competitive pricing and modern payment solutions, making it challenging for PYPL to maintain its market share.
4. **Regulatory Environment:** The recent changes in regulations regarding data privacy and security are affecting the payment processing industry. PYPL needs to adapt to these new regulations to avoid potential fines and reputational damage.

**Key Takeaways:**
