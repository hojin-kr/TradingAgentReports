Based on the tool calls, I've compiled a comprehensive report of the current state of the world that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics.

**Global Market Trends**

The global market has experienced a mixed bag over the past week. On one hand, the S&P 500 index reached an all-time high, indicating a strong sentiment among investors. However, the NASDAQ composite index fell due to concerns over the tech sector's performance.

According to Google News, the US economy showed signs of slowdown in November, with the number of initial jobless claims increasing. This is a cause for concern as it may indicate a slowing down of economic growth.

Finnhub news also reported that the Chinese economy continued to slow down, with the factory gate prices falling for the fourth consecutive month. This is a warning sign for global trade and markets.
