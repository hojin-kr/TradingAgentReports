No transaction proposal can be made based on the data provided. However, here is a summary of the key points:

*   The 50 SMA values are not available for the specified period due to it only being able to retrieve data from January 1st, 2022.
*   The MACD values are also not available for the same reason as the 50 SMA.
*   The RSI values are not available for the specified period.
*   Without having a clear view of the 50 SMA, MACD, and RSI trends over time, it's difficult to make an informed decision about buying, holding, or selling VBI.
