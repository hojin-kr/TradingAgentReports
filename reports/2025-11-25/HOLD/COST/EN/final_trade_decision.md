Decision: HOLD

**Summary of Key Arguments**

Risky Analyst: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) faces significant challenges that outweigh any potential benefits, including high debt levels, declining cash flow, and dependence on physical stores. However, these factors can be seen as opportunities for growth and transformation.

Neutral Analyst: While COST has some weaknesses, I believe it still has room for growth and expansion. The recent Q3 2025 earnings results were a testament to the company's ability to navigate difficult times.

Safe Analyst: I agree that Costco has shown resilience in the past, but I think we need to be careful about how far we reach in assuming this will continue. A more conservative approach is necessary to minimize risk and ensure steady growth.

**Rationale**

The Risky Analyst's argument relies heavily on the potential for growth and transformation in COST, which may not be supported by concrete evidence. While high debt levels and declining cash flow are concerns, they can also be seen as opportunities for growth if managed correctly.

On the other hand, the Neutral Analyst's argument is more optimistic, but it also raises questions about the company's ability to overcome its weaknesses. The recent earnings results were a positive sign, but they may not be indicative of future performance.

The Safe Analyst's approach is more cautious, focusing on minimizing risk and ensuring steady growth. While this approach may limit potential gains, it also reduces the likelihood of significant losses.

**Refined Trader's Plan**

Based on the debate, I recommend a **Sell** recommendation for COST stock at this time. The combination of high debt levels, declining cash flow, dependence on physical stores, and vulnerability to economic downturns outweigh any potential benefits.

To mitigate potential losses, I suggest setting a stop-loss order at $350 per share and reducing position size to 20% of total portfolio. Additionally, diversifying the portfolio by allocating assets to other low-cost index funds and ETFs can help minimize risk.

Regular portfolio rebalancing is also essential to ensure that it remains aligned with investment objectives. By taking a more conservative approach, we can limit our exposure to extreme volatility and focus on steady, reliable growth.

**Investment Plan**

1.  **Stop-Loss Order:** Set a stop-loss order at $350 per share to limit potential losses in case the stock price declines further.
2.  **Position Sizing:** Reduce position size to 20% of total portfolio to minimize exposure to high-risk investment opportunity.
3.  **Diversification:** Diversify portfolio by allocating assets to other low-cost index funds and ETFs.
4.  **Regular Portfolio Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with investment objectives.

By following this refined trader's plan, we can minimize potential losses and avoid significant financial harm due to the high-risk nature of COST stock.
