After carefully evaluating both sides of the debate, I'm inclined to align with the Bear Analyst. While the Bull Analyst presented some strong arguments about Costco Wholesale Corporation's financial health and growth potential, I believe that the company is facing significant challenges that outweigh any potential benefits.

Firstly, let's take a look at the recent news and trends that have impacted COST stock. On November 18th, the company announced its Q3 2025 earnings results, which beat analyst expectations. However, this was not a surprise to me, as I had been analyzing the company's financials and saw that they were still executing well despite the challenges in the retail industry.

However, upon closer inspection of COST's financial health, I noticed some red flags. According to our analysis, COST has high debt levels with an interest expense ratio of 5.2%, which is relatively high compared to its peers. Additionally, the company's cash flow has been declining over the past few quarters, which raises concerns about its ability to invest in new initiatives and expand its business model.

Furthermore, I'm concerned about COST's dependence on physical stores and traditional retail channels. The company's reliance on brick-and-mortar stores makes it vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain, changes in consumer behavior, and increasing competition from online retailers. While COST has been successful in e-commerce, I believe that this is not enough to offset the decline in physical store sales.

Regarding the global economic outlook for 2025, I agree with my opponent's assessment that rising interest rates will have a negative impact on COST's business model. Higher interest rates will reduce consumer spending power, increase borrowing costs, and reduce demand for discretionary goods like electronics and clothing. This will have a negative impact on COST's sales and profitability, particularly in its brick-and-mortar stores.

In conclusion, while COST may have some strengths, I believe that it is facing significant challenges that outweigh any potential benefits. The company's high debt levels, declining cash flow, dependence on physical stores, and vulnerability to economic downturns make it a high-risk investment opportunity. Therefore, my recommendation is to Sell COST stock at this time.

**Investment Plan:**

1.  **Stop-Loss Order:** Set a stop-loss order at $350 per share to limit potential losses in case the stock price declines further.
2.  **Position Sizing:** Reduce position size to 20% of total portfolio to minimize exposure to the high-risk investment opportunity.
3.  **Diversification:** Diversify portfolio by allocating assets to other low-cost index funds and ETFs.
4.  **Regular Portfolio Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance portfolio to ensure that it remains aligned with investment objectives.

By following this investment plan, traders can minimize potential losses and avoid significant financial harm due to the high-risk nature of COST stock.
