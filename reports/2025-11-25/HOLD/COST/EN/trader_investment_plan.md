Based on the comprehensive analysis provided by the team of analysts, I agree that Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) faces significant challenges that outweigh any potential benefits. The recent announcement of Q3 2025 earnings results, while beating analyst expectations, does not change the overall narrative.

The high debt levels, with an interest expense ratio of 5.2%, and declining cash flow raise concerns about the company's ability to invest in new initiatives and expand its business model. Moreover, COST's dependence on physical stores and traditional retail channels makes it vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain, changes in consumer behavior, and increasing competition from online retailers.

Considering these factors, I concur with the decision to sell COST stock at this time. The proposed investment plan, which includes a stop-loss order, reduced position sizing, diversification, and regular portfolio rebalancing, is reasonable and aimed at minimizing potential losses.

**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: SELL**
