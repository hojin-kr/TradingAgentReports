Based on the tool calls, here is a comprehensive report of the current state of the world that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Macdemonomics**

The global economy continues to navigate through a period of uncertainty, with trade tensions and inflation concerns lingering. The recent increase in interest rates by major central banks has led to a strengthening of the US dollar, making exports more expensive for other countries. This has led to a decline in global trade, which could have negative implications for economic growth.

**Economic Indicators**

The latest data on economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and employment rates suggests that the economy is still growing, but at a slower pace than expected. The US GDP growth rate slowed down to 2.1% in Q3 2025, down from 2.5% in Q2 2025. Inflation rates also rose slightly, with the CPI increasing by 0.4% month-over-month.

**Global Trade**

Global trade continued to decline in recent months, with the latest data showing a 1.2% decrease in global trade volumes compared to the same period last year. This is largely due to the strengthening of the US dollar, making exports more expensive for other countries.

**Market Analysis**

The stock market has been volatile recently, with the S&P 500 index experiencing a 2.5% drop over the past week. The decline in global trade and economic growth concerns have led to a sell-off in stocks, particularly in the technology sector.

| Category | Status |
