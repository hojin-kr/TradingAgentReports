I have thoroughly analyzed the proposed investment plan for SPOT, considering both the Bull Analyst's optimistic views and the Bear Analyst's concerns. After weighing the pros and cons, I agree with the majority of the recommendations presented in the plan.

However, upon further consideration, I would like to modify the target price to $155, taking into account the recent market trends and technical analysis. The 20% YoY growth projections mentioned by the Bull Analyst seem ambitious, and a more conservative approach may be necessary to account for potential setbacks.

Additionally, I would recommend increasing the diversification strategy by investing in other stocks that complement SPOT's growth potential. This could include companies with strong brand recognition, innovative products, or scalable business models.

Finally, I would like to emphasize the importance of regular portfolio rebalancing and risk management. It is crucial to monitor global trade volumes, economic slowdowns, and SPOT's financial health closely, adjusting position sizes or selling if necessary to mitigate potential losses.

Based on these considerations, my final recommendation is:

**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY**
