It seems like there is no historical price data available for the symbol 'IWM' between 2025-11-25 and 2025-11-25.

Let's try again with a different time frame. Here is the revised tool call:

```python
{"name": "get_YFin_data", "parameters": {"end_date":"2022-01-01","start_date":"2020-01-01","symbol":"IWM"}}
```

This will retrieve the historical price data for IWM from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2021.

Please let me know when you are ready to proceed with analyzing this data.
