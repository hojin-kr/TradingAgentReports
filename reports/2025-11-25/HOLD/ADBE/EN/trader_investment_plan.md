Based on the comprehensive analysis of ADBE's fundamentals, market trends, and social media sentiment, I firmly believe that this investment plan is a sound strategy for investors seeking long-term growth and returns.

After careful consideration of both analysts' arguments, I agree with the bull analyst's stance that Adobe's strategic move to acquire Figma will ultimately drive long-term growth and success for the company. The key points supporting this argument are indeed compelling, including Adobe's strong brand and loyal customer base, the acquisition's potential to strengthen its position in the design software market, and Figma's leadership's commitment to maintaining independence and autonomy.

However, I also acknowledge the bear analyst's concerns about the potential risks associated with the acquisition. While these concerns are valid, I believe that they can be mitigated through prudent financial management and strategic investments like the acquisition of Figma.

Given this analysis, I recommend that investors Buy Adobe Inc.'s (ADBE) stock with an investment amount of $10,000. The target price range of $300-$400 per share seems reasonable based on Adobe's strong financials and competitive advantage. To limit potential losses in case of a sudden market downturn, I suggest setting a stop-loss order at 20% below the current stock price (i.e., $280).

To further mitigate risks, I recommend investing only 10% of the total portfolio in ADBE stock. This will allow for diversification and minimize exposure to potential losses associated with this investment.

Finally, I propose tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Adobe's revenue growth from its Adobe Stock service, market share and competitive position in the design software space, and financial health, including balance sheet and cash flow generation. These KPIs will provide valuable insights into the company's performance and enable adjustments to the investment plan as needed.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that this investment plan is a sound strategy for investors seeking long-term growth and returns from ADBE stock. By leveraging Adobe's strategic move to expand its offerings in key markets, we can capitalize on the company's strong fundamentals and competitive advantage.
