It seems that the symbol 'BRK.B' is not a valid stock ticker. BRK.B represents Berkshire Hathaway Inc. class B shares, which are traded on the OTC market under the ticker symbol BRK.A for Class A shares.

Let's try again with the correct symbol.

```python
{"name": "get_YFin_data", "parameters": {"end_date":"2025-11-25","start_date":"2020-01-01","symbol":"BRK.A"}}
```

This will retrieve the historical price data for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. class A shares from January 1, 2020 to November 25, 2025.

After retrieving the data, we can proceed with calculating the selected indicators. Please let me know which indicators you would like to analyze first.
