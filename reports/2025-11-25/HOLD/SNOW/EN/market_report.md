FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the provided data, here is an analysis of the current market conditions:

**Trend Analysis:** 
The 50-day SMA values show a general upward trend from November 10th to November 25th, with some minor fluctuations. The Bollinger Middle value also indicates an overall upward trend.

**Momentum Analysis:**
RSI values have been oscillating between overbought and oversold conditions throughout the period, indicating potential reversals. However, on November 19th and 20th, RSI values crossed above the 70 threshold, suggesting a strong uptrend.

**Volatility Analysis:**
Bollinger Middle and Upper/Below Bands indicate moderate volatility with some sharp movements on November 18th-20th. However, ATR is not directly available for this time frame, so we cannot accurately analyze it here.

Based on the above analysis, I would propose a **BUY/HOLD** strategy for Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) from November 25th onwards, targeting the long-term uptrend supported by the 50-day SMA and Bollinger Middle values.

**Key Points to Monitor:**

1. RSI Divergences: Watch for divergences between RSI and price movements to confirm trend reversals.
2. Price Breakouts: Monitor Bollinger Band breakouts, especially above the upper band, as potential buy signals.
3. Volatility Cues: Keep an eye on ATR and Bollinger Bands for signs of increased volatility that may indicate a need to adjust positions.
