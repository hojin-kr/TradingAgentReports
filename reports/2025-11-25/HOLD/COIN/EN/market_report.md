FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the provided indicators, here's a detailed analysis of COIN's market condition:

COIN's 50 SMA has been steadily increasing from 334.20 on November 10th to 325.61 on November 24th, indicating a moderate uptrend. However, the RSI values have been fluctuating wildly, ranging from 28.85 on November 21st to 45.61 on November 12th. This volatility suggests that COIN might be experiencing a mix of bullish and bearish momentum.

The RSI values also indicate that COIN has been oversold in recent days, with the indicator reading below 30 on multiple occasions (November 20th-24th). This could be a good opportunity for buyers to get back into the market, as oversold conditions can lead to a rebound.

Considering these factors, a **BUY** proposal is suggested for COIN, with a target price of $350-$370 and a stop-loss at $320. Traders should monitor the 50 SMA and RSI indicators closely to confirm the trend direction and ensure that the rebound is indeed occurring.

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| close_50_sma | 325.61 | Moderate uptrend |
| rsi | 35.90 | Oversold condition, potential rebound |
