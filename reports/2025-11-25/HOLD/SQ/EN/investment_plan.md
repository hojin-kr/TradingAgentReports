I'm going to have to side with the bear analyst on this one. While the bull presented some compelling arguments about Square's (SQ) long-term growth potential and competitive advantages, I think the risks and challenges associated with investing in the stock outweigh any potential benefits.

Firstly, the lack of historical data on SQ's 50-day SMA, MACD values, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and ATR makes it difficult to assess the company's trend and volatility. This is a significant limitation for making trading decisions, and I think the bull is being overly optimistic by relying on current trends rather than historical data.

Additionally, the social media sentiment report from Reddit suggests that there are broader concerns among users about SQ's customer service and high fees, which could impact the company's reputation and ability to attract new customers. While the bull acknowledged these concerns, I think they were downplayed too much.

Regarding macroeconomic news, the concerns about inflation rates increasing beyond central banks' target rates are valid, and I don't think SQ's focus on digital payments can mitigate these risks enough to offset them. The bear analyst is right to emphasize that these challenges could hinder SQ's performance in the years to come.

My recommendation for this trader would be to Sell. While I acknowledge that SQ has some attractive features, such as its innovative products and expanding customer base, I think the risks associated with investing in the stock outweigh any potential benefits. The lack of historical data, concerns about customer service, and macroeconomic challenges all contribute to my cautious stance.

Here's a detailed investment plan for this trader:

1. Sell SQ immediately, with a target price of $100 or lower.
2. Reallocate 50% of the portfolio to cash or other low-risk investments.
3. Monitor the market trends and wait for more historical data before making any further trading decisions.
4. Consider setting stop-loss orders at $80-$90 to limit potential losses if the stock price falls below these levels.
5. Keep a close eye on SQ's customer service and fees, as changes in this area could impact the company's reputation and attractiveness to customers.

Overall, I think the risks associated with investing in SQ outweigh any potential benefits, and this trader would be wise to take a cautious approach by selling the stock and reallocating their portfolio to more stable investments.
