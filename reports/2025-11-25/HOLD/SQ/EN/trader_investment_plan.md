Based on the comprehensive analysis provided, I agree with the bear analyst's perspective that the risks associated with investing in Square (SQ) outweigh any potential benefits. The lack of historical data on key metrics such as SMA, MACD values, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and ATR makes it challenging to assess the company's trend and volatility.

Moreover, the concerns about customer service and high fees highlighted by social media sentiment reports from Reddit are valid and could impact SQ's reputation and ability to attract new customers. While the bull analyst acknowledged these concerns, I believe they were downplayed too much.

Regarding macroeconomic news, the potential risks associated with increasing inflation rates beyond central banks' target rates are a significant concern. Despite SQ's focus on digital payments, I don't think it can mitigate these risks enough to offset them.

Considering these factors, my recommendation is to **SELL** Square (SQ) immediately, with a target price of $100 or lower. This will help the trader minimize potential losses and reallocate their portfolio to more stable investments.

Additionally, I would recommend setting stop-loss orders at $80-$90 to limit potential losses if the stock price falls below these levels.

My reasoning is as follows:

* The lack of historical data on key metrics makes it difficult to assess SQ's trend and volatility.
* Concerns about customer service and high fees could impact the company's reputation and ability to attract new customers.
* Macroeconomic risks associated with increasing inflation rates are a significant concern that cannot be mitigated by SQ's focus on digital payments.

By selling SQ immediately, the trader can:

* Minimize potential losses
* Reallocate their portfolio to more stable investments
* Monitor market trends and wait for more historical data before making further trading decisions

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
