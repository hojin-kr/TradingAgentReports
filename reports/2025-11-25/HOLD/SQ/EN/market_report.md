**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the analysis of the provided data, it is not possible to make a buy, hold, or sell recommendation for SQ due to lack of historical price data between 2025-01-01 and 2025-11-25.

However, since no specific time frame was given, I will provide a general analysis. The data available shows that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, indicating an overall uptrend in SQ's price movement. However, without more historical data, it's challenging to determine if this trend will continue or reverse.

The MACD values are not available due to lack of historical data, but typically, a bullish crossover between the MACD line and its signal would indicate a potential buy opportunity. However, with no MACD values provided, this cannot be confirmed.

RSI is also not applicable without price data, but in general, a reading above 70 may indicate overbought conditions, while a reading below 30 may indicate oversold conditions.

Bollinger Bands are available but only for the last day (2025-11-25), which doesn't provide enough information to make a trading decision.

ATR is not applicable without price data.

In summary, due to lack of historical data, it's impossible to make a buy, hold, or sell recommendation for SQ.
