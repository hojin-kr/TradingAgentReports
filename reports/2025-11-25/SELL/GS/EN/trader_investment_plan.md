Based on the comprehensive analysis provided by the team of analysts, I have carefully evaluated the pros and cons of investing in GS stock. After considering the technical market trends, macroeconomic indicators, social media sentiment, and industry analysis, I concur with the Bear Analyst's recommendations.

The proposed investment plan to reduce exposure, implement risk management strategies, monitor the company's performance, and re-evaluate the investment after 6-12 months is a prudent approach. However, considering my previous experiences and lessons learned from similar situations, I would like to add a few additional considerations to further minimize potential losses.

Firstly, I would recommend increasing the stop-loss order to $120 per share to account for any unexpected market fluctuations or company-specific events that could negatively impact GS stock.

Secondly, I would suggest diversifying our portfolio by allocating 20% of our assets to other technology stocks that are showing promising growth potential and have a stronger innovation pipeline. This would help spread risk and potentially mitigate the impact of any losses incurred in GS stock.

Lastly, I would like to add an additional layer of risk management by setting a floor price for GS stock at $100 per share. If the stock price falls below this threshold, we would reassess our investment strategy and consider adjusting our position accordingly.

In light of these considerations, my final recommendation is to Sell GS stock due to its high-risk profile and significant potential downsides.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
