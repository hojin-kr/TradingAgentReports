Based on the recent news and trends from EODHD, finnhub, reddit, and google, here's a comprehensive report on the current state of the world that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Global Economy:**

The global economy has experienced a mixed bag of news over the past week. On the positive side, the US GDP growth rate accelerated to 2.1% in Q3, beating expectations of 1.9%. This indicates a robust consumer spending sector, which is a key driver of economic growth.

However, there are concerns about the impact of rising interest rates on the economy. The Fed has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which may lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. This could potentially slow down economic growth.

**Markets:**

The stock market has been experiencing volatility over the past week. The S&P 500 index fell by 1.5% on Wednesday, due to concerns about the impact of rising interest rates on corporate earnings. However, the index rebounded on Thursday, driven by gains in the technology sector.

The dollar index also rose sharply on Monday, due to concerns about inflation and the Fed's tightening monetary policy. This made US exports more expensive, which could lead to lower demand for US goods and services.

**Central Banks:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised interest rates by 25 basis points to control inflation, which has been hovering above target levels. The move is expected to slow down economic growth, but may help keep prices under control.

The European Central Bank (ECB) left its monetary policy unchanged, despite rising concerns about inflation and economic slowdown. This decision was seen as a surprise by many market participants, who had expected the ECB to raise interest rates.

**Geopolitics:**

Tensions between the US and China continued to escalate over the past week. The two countries have been engaged in a trade war for several years, which has had significant implications for global trade and economic growth.

The US imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods, which led to retaliatory measures from China. This has resulted in higher prices for consumers and businesses, which could slow down economic growth.
