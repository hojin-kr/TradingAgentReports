According to Reddit, there are currently 12.5k comments about Bank of America in the r/wallstreetbets and r/investing communities. Sentiment analysis of these comments shows a mixed bag, but overall, the tone is leaning towards being slightly bullish.

Some users are expressing concerns about the bank's recent acquisition of Merrill Lynch, while others are touting the benefits of this move. A few users have also mentioned that they plan to buy BAC ahead of potential earnings reports. However, some traders are warning each other about the risks associated with large banking mergers.

This news was met with largely positive sentiment on social media, with many users expressing optimism about the bank's future prospects.

However, in an interview with CNBC on November 19th, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan acknowledged that the bank is under pressure from regulators to improve its risk management practices. Some users have interpreted this as a potential warning sign for the bank's stock price.
