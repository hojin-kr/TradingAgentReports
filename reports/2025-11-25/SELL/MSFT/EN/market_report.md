It seems that there is no historical data available for MSFT on the specified date range.

Let me try again with a different date range. Since I don't have any data, I'll use the last trading day's data which is November 24th, 2025.

{"name": "get_YFin_data", "parameters": {"end_date":"2025-11-24","start_date":"2025-06-01","symbol":"MSFT"}}
