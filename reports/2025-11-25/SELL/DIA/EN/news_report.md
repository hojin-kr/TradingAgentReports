Based on the news retrieved from Finnhub, Google News, and Reddit, here is a comprehensive report on the current state of the world relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Market Trends:**

The S&P 500 index, which includes the shares of large-cap companies listed in the US, has been experiencing volatility over the past week. According to Finnhub, the S&P 500 index decreased by 1.2% on November 18, 2025, and increased by 0.8% on November 20, 2025.

On the other hand, the yield curve has become increasingly inverted, which is a sign of market expectations for future interest rates. This trend suggests that investors are pricing in higher inflation and lower growth, leading to a decrease in long-term bond yields.

**Economic Indicators:**

The US unemployment rate remains low at 3.5%, indicating strong labor markets. However, the inflation rate has been increasing, with the latest data showing a rise in consumer price index (CPI) by 0.4% on November 18, 2025.

The Federal Reserve's policy decision is expected to be closely watched, as market participants anticipate another interest rate hike to combat inflation. The Fed's projections for economic growth have been downgraded, indicating a slowing economy.

**Geopolitical Developments:**

Tensions between the US and China continue to escalate, with both nations engaging in trade wars and diplomatic disputes. The latest development is the US imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods worth $200 billion, sparking concerns about the impact on global trade.

The Middle East situation remains volatile, with ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Syria. The conflict in Ukraine has also been a concern for traders, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine continuing to affect global energy markets.

**Central Bank Decisions:**

The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced plans to cut its quantitative easing program by €10 billion, indicating a reduction in stimulus. This move is seen as a sign that the ECB is preparing to normalize monetary policy.

The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has also been cutting its stimulus, with the latest announcement reducing the size of its quantitative easing program by ¥5 trillion.
