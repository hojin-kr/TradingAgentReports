Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit/stock-info data for AMZN for 2025-09-07, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like there’s a tool-side issue right now. I can retry the data pull, but in the meantime here’s a thorough, high-signal analysis framework you can use once the data comes back, plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table at the end.

What I can deliver right now (planning and framework)
- Objective: Produce a comprehensive, trader-focused report on AMZN using social sentiment (primarily Reddit and other public chatter), and recent company news over the past week. The goal is to extract themes, quantify sentiment momentum, identify catalysts and risks, and translate them into actionable trading implications.
- What I will cover when the data pull succeeds:
  - Daily sentiment trend (positive/neutral/negative) and volume on AMZN across relevant social platforms.
  - Top topics, questions, and anecdotes driving sentiment (e.g., AWS growth, consumer spend, logistics costs, regulatory/regulatory risk, AI integration, Prime-related news).
  - News highlights and their sentiment impact (earnings expectations, product announcements, regulatory updates, competitive dynamics).
  - Event-driven catalysts and risk factors anticipated in the near term (next 1–2 weeks).
  - Price correlation context (if sentiment spikes align with price moves, potential predictability or divergence signals).
  - Trading implications and scenarios (bullish/bearish setups, risk management, hedging ideas).
- Methodology notes (so you know how results will be derived once the tool returns):
  - Quantify sentiment with day-by-day polarity scores and weighting by post volume.
  - Extract recurring themes via topic modeling or keyword clustering (AWS, advertising, logistics, AI, regulatory, Prime Day, etc.).
  - Cross-check Reddit signals with other sources (if available) for corroboration.
  - Identify outliers or “surprise” posts that could precede outsized price moves.
- What you’ll get in the final deliverable:
  - A narrative synthesis of sentiment and news, plus precise trader-oriented takeaways.
  - A structured, easy-to-parse Markdown table of key points and signals.
  - Clear next-step recommendations for different risk tolerances.

What I can provide right now (ready-to-use report skeleton with placeholders)
Note: The following content is prepared as a detailed framework. Once the data pull succeeds, I will replace placeholders with actual numbers, counts, and quotes.

Executive snapshot
- Sentiment momentum: [Positive/Neutral/Negative], with a daily delta of [X] over the past week.
- Core drivers observed in chatter: [AWS performance, advertising monetization, Prime/consumer spend signals, logistics/costs, AI-related features, regulatory/regulatory scrutiny, product launches].
- News backdrop: [Key headlines from the past week], and their perceived impact on sentiment.

Social sentiment analysis (framework)
- Daily sentiment trend:
  - Day 1: [Positive/Neutral/Negative], volume [V1]
  - Day 2: [Positive/Neutral/Negative], volume [V2]
  - …
- Top topics driving sentiment (most mentions):
  - Topic A: [AWS growth / Advertising monetization / Prime updates / Logistics costs / etc.]
  - Topic B: [Regulatory risk / AI integration / Competition]
  - Topic C: [Earnings expectations / Guidance]
- Notable posts or themes:
  - Example post: “[quote or paraphrase]” with observed sentiment weight.
  - Topic implication: [how this could influence trader perception]

News and catalysts (past week)
- Headline summaries with observable sentiment impact:
  - Headline 1: [Summary] — Sentiment impact: [Positive/Negative/Neutral]
  - Headline 2: [Summary] — Sentiment impact: [Positive/Negative/Neutral]
  - Headline 3: [Summary] — Sentiment impact: [Positive/Negative/Neutral]
- Likelihood of near-term catalysts:
  - Catalyst A: [AWS / Advertising / Prime / Regulation], probability and potential price impact
  - Catalyst B: [Operational or product-specific], probability and potential price impact
  - Catalyst C: [Regulatory or macro], probability and potential price impact

Risk signals and caveats
- Sentiment risk: any persistent negative chatter around [topic], with potential to pressure near-term performance.
- News risk: regulatory developments or large-scale cost concerns could exert outsized moves.
- Model risk: sentiment data can be noisy; use as a leading indicator rather than a sole driver.

Trading implications (near-term, data-driven)
- Baseline scenario: If sentiment improves alongside positive news on AWS/advertising, risk-on setup near support levels.
- Bearish scenario: If negative headlines dominate and price action breaks key levels, consider hedges (puts, call spreads on downside equity exposures, or hedged long/short positions).
- Optional hedges: dynamic exposure sizing around anticipated news events; consider volatility-aware positions if implied volatility jumps around news windows.

Action items for you
- I will re-run the data pull as soon as the tool is available again, and deliver a filled-in, data-backed report with:
  - Daily sentiment scores and volumes
  - Top Reddit topics and top posts
  - Recent news highlights with sentiment tags
  - A final, trader-focused conclusions and a compact set of trading ideas
- If you prefer, I can proceed now with the framework as a living document and update it incrementally as data comes in.

Markdown table (ready to populate with real data)
Please note: The numbers below are placeholders to show the expected format. They will be replaced with actual figures once the data pull succeeds.

| Dimension | Detail | Example / Placeholder |
|---|---|---|
| Timeframe | Last 7 days ending 2025-09-07 | [Data will fill here] |
| Overall sentiment (avg) | Positive / Neutral / Negative | [P/N/Neg] |
| Sentiment delta (daily) | Net change per day | [Δ1, Δ2, …] |
| Top Reddit topics | 1) Topic A 2) Topic B 3) Topic C | [A, B, C] |
| Most mentioned topics sentiment | Topic A: Pos/Neu/Neg | [Pos/Neu/Neg] |
| Notable posts (examples) | Post titles or quotes | ["Example post 1", "Example post 2"] |
| Key news headlines (last 7 days) | Headline - Sentiment | ["Head1 - Pos", "Head2 - Neg"] |
| Near-term catalysts | Catalyst and probability | ["Catalyst A - 40%", "Catalyst B - 25%"] |

| Trading implication | Suggested stance | ["Long if sentiment improves", "Hedge near events"] |

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull now and then deliver the fully populated report? If you’d prefer, I can also proceed with the framework above and update you as soon as the tool returns results.
