Status: Data retrieval for AMZN pricing and indicators in this session failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the data environment. I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with a structured plan and interpretation framework once data becomes available. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators and why they are suitable for AMZN given a mid-term to long-term trend perspective, plus how I would interpret them once the data is retrieved.

Selected indicators (8 total) and rationale
- close_50_sma
  - Why: Captures the mid-term trend and acts as a dynamic support/resistance level. Helps identify the prevailing drift (up, down, or range-bound) in AMZN’s price over weeks to months.
  - What to watch: Price crossing above/below the 50 SMA can signal trend initiation or continuation; use in conjunction with shorter-term momentum signals to time entries.
- close_200_sma
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming the overall market regime (bullish/bearish) and spotting major trend changes (golden/death cross with shorter moving averages).
  - What to watch: Price trading above the 200 SMA generally supports a bullish framework; price below can indicate a broader down-trend or consolidation risk.
- close_10_ema
  - Why: A responsive short-term average to capture quick momentum shifts, helpful for spotting near-term entry points in a stock with fast-moving price action like AMZN.
  - What to watch: Crosses with the 50 SMA or price action above/below can provide timely signals, but watch for noise in choppy markets.
- macd
  - Why: Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line crossovers and the distance from zero. Good for confirming shifts in AMZN’s momentum in tandem with price action.
  - What to watch: MACD line crossing the signal, and MACD histogram changes, especially when aligned with price/volume strength.
- macds
  - Why: The MACD Signal line provides smoother confirmations of MACD crossovers. Helps filter false signals from the MACD line alone.
  - What to watch: Crossovers of MACD with MACDS can validate entry/exit points when supported by price trends.
- rsi
  - Why: Momentum gauge showing overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences. Complements trend indicators to flag possible reversals.
  - What to watch: Readings near 70/30 thresholds and potential bearish/bullish divergences against price action and trend context.
- atr
  - Why: Volatility measure to gauge risk and position sizing. Important for setting stop levels in a stock like AMZN that can experience wide intraday swings.
  - What to watch: Rising ATR often accompanies breakouts or high-volatility periods; use to adjust stop-loss placement and risk per trade.
- vwma
  - Why: Volume-weighted moving average adds a volume-confirmation perspective to price trends, helping differentiate genuine moves from price noise.
  - What to watch: Price moving with VWMA and above/below can indicate stronger trend conviction when volume supports the move.

How I would interpret these together (framework you can apply once data is back)
- Trend confirmation: If price trades above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with the 10 EMA above the price and/or the SMAs trending higher, AMZN is in a constructive longer-term trend. Look for pullbacks toward the 50 SMA as potential dip buys in a confirmed uptrend, with protective stops set via ATR.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and MACDS turning positive (line cross above zero, MACD above MACDS) coupled with RSI holding above 50 supports ongoing upside momentum. RSI near extremes (overbought) should be interpreted in the context of the trend (in a strong uptrend, RSI can stay high for extended periods).
- Volatility and risk management: ATR rising suggests higher volatility and wider price swings; adjust position size and stop placement accordingly. If ATR contracts, consider tightening stops as volatility reduces.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA rising in tandem with price gains reinforces the validity of moves; if price advances but VWMA lags or diverges, be cautious of potential reversals or weaker conviction moves.
- Reversion vs continuation signals: RSI turning around from oversold (below 30) or divergence against price in a trend could indicate a potential reversal or a shallow pullback, especially if MACD shows fading momentum and price remains below major moving averages.

Operational next steps
- I will retry fetching the data and the indicator reports as soon as the environment allows. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry the data pull for AMZN for 2024-09-07 to 2025-09-07, then compute and present the eight indicators (the ones listed above) with a detailed trend report.
  - Or proceed with a qualitative, non-data-driven interpretation framework based on recent historical patterns for AMZN, while clearly labeling that it lacks live-data confirmation.

What I need from you
- Tell me if you want me to retry immediately (I’ll attempt again to fetch the data and indicators).
- Or confirm that I should proceed with the qualitative framework described above while we wait for data retrieval.

Appendix: Key points at a glance
- Indicators chosen: close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macds, rsi, atr, vwma
- Coverage: trend direction (short/medium/long term), momentum, volatility, and volume confirmation
- Intended use: combine signals to inform entry/exit levels and risk management for AMZN, with emphasis on reducing false signals in a high-velocity stock.

Markdown table: Key points by indicator
- Indicator | Primary purpose | How to interpret signals in AMZN
- close_50_sma | Mid-term trend support/resistance | Price above -> bullish bias; pullbacks to 50 SMA as potential entries; cross above a rising 50 SMA strengthens trend
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above -> bullish regime; price below -> potential long-term weakness or consolidation
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum capture | Quick momentum shifts; cross above price or above longer SMAs suggests near-term strength
- macd | Momentum/trend-change signal | MACD cross above MACDS and positive histogram indicate momentum buildup; confirm with price/volume
- macds | Smoother momentum confirmation | Crossover with MACD line confirms entry/exit signals
- rsi | Momentum strength, overbought/oversold | RSI above 50 supports uptrend; near/above 70 signals potential overbought; look for divergence with price
- atr | Volatility and risk management | Rising ATR indicates higher volatility; adjust stops/position sizing accordingly
- vwma | Volume-adjusted trend confirmation | Price movement with rising VWMA reinforces trend conviction; discordance may warn of exhaustion

If you want me to proceed, I’ll retry the data fetch and then deliver a detailed, data-driven trend report using these eight indicators for AMZN.
