Recommendation: Buy, with a disciplined, staged-entry plan and clear risk controls.

Rationale (alignment with the plan you provided)
- Durable, multi-front growth engine: AWS remains the core profitability driver, with AI-enabled cloud initiatives likely to lift incremental margins as adoption scales. Ad revenue and Prime monetization add high-margin, recurring tailwinds and cross-sell opportunities that can lift household ARPU over time.
- Structural catalysts with upside: International expansion (Axio in India, JetBlue Kuiper), and cross-segment ecosystem effects create longer-term TAM expansion and monetization opportunities beyond core e-commerce and cloud.
- Manageable near-term risk, asymmetric upside: While valuation and regulatory/ churn risks exist, the plan argues for a favorable long-run free cash flow trajectory supported by operating leverage as AI infrastructure scales.

Risk considerations (acknowledging the bear case)
- Near-term headwinds: Prime churn risk from potential sharing-rule changes, capex drag on free cash flow, regulatory scrutiny, and competitive pressures impacting margins in the short run.
- Valuation and rate sensitivity: Elevated multiple in a rising-rate environment can amplify downside if catalysts underperform.
- Execution risk: AI infrastructure spend vs. realized margin uplift can be lumpy; regulatory shifts could alter unit economics.

Entry and risk-management plan (execution)
- Phase 1: Initiate a modest core position at 1–2% of the portfolio, reflecting stock volatility and your risk tolerance.
- Phase 2: Add incrementally on favorable price action or meaningful pullbacks that maintain a constructive setup (stability above key support, favorable trend signals, and no breakdown of technicals) to reinforce the bull thesis.
- Stop losses and hedging: Implement a stop-loss band from entry (e.g., a defined percentage downside or a violation of a near-term support level). Consider optional hedges (protective puts or a collar around key catalysts) to manage event risk without capping upside.
- Position sizing: Use a pyramiding approach, scaling into the name with risk-based increments rather than a large, single entry.

Catalysts and monitoring (what to watch)
- Prime monetization trajectory: Churn metrics, ARPU trends, and cross-sell performance around earnings windows.
- AWS/AI adoption and margin trajectory: Cloud bookings velocity, utilization, and realized incremental margins as AI services scale.
- International monetization milestones: Progress on Axio lending in India and JetBlue Kuiper deployment and monetization.
- Regulatory and policy updates: Track changes to sharing rules, platform fees, data access, privacy requirements, and their potential impact on unit economics.

Operational discipline (cadence and learning)
- Quarterly reassessment: Review AWS margin progression, Prime monetization progress, and regulatory updates; adjust targets if AI-enabled margin lift accelerates or if monetization stalls.
- Scenario framework: Maintain base/bull/bear paths with explicit probabilities and trigger events to avoid overconfidence.
- Learning loop: Apply disciplined learning from data; validate whether AI-related capex is delivering long-run cash flow uplift or merely higher near-term costs.
