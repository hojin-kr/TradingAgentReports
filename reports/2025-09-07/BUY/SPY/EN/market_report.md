I attempted to fetch SPY data and the requested indicator analyses, but I’m hitting a FileNotFoundError from the data source. I can’t pull the current values right now. If you’d like, I can retry in a moment, or proceed with a structured, non-data-dependent plan and what I’d look for once the data comes back. In the meantime, here’s a concise, risk-aware framework tailored for SPY using a diverse set of indicators (up to 8) that complements each other well.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale
1) close_50_sma
- What it measures: 50-period simple moving average, mid-term trend.
- Why it’s suitable: Provides a clear sense of the intermediate trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for filtering signals from faster indicators.
- How to use: Look for price crossing the 50 SMA for potential trend initiation/confirmation; use in conjunction with longer-term trend signals.

2) close_200_sma
- What it measures: 200-period simple moving average, long-term trend.
- Why it’s suitable: Acts as a strong, widely watched benchmark for the overall market direction. Helps identify major regime shifts (golden cross/death cross).
- How to use: Confirm trend regime with the 50 SMA; a cross of price above/below the 200 SMA supports more durable trend bets or risk-off/risk-on posture.

3) close_10_ema
- What it measures: 10-period exponential moving average, short-term trend/momentum.
- Why it’s suitable: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry/exit points; more responsive than the SMAs.
- How to use: Pair with the 50/200 SMAs to discern short-term pullbacks versus genuine trend changes; look for price/EMA crossovers for tactical entries.

4) macd
- What it measures: MACD line based on EMA differences, momentum magnitude.
- Why it’s suitable: Core momentum tool to identify trend changes via crossovers and divergence.
- How to use: Watch for MACD line crossing above/below zero, and crossovers with the MACD Signal for potential entries/exits. Use with price structure and volatility context.

5) macds
- What it measures: MACD Signal line (the EMA of MACD).
- Why it’s suitable: Smoothing of MACD helps reduce false signals; crossovers with MACD provide clearer signals.
- How to use: Confirm MACD cross signals; a MACD crossing the MACD Signal is a common trigger in combination with other filters (volume, price action).

6) macdh
- What it measures: MACD Histogram (difference between MACD and its signal).
- Why it’s suitable: Visualizes momentum strength and accelerations; useful for spotting early divergences and momentum fatigue.
- How to use: Increasing histogram supports ongoing momentum; a shrinking or negative histogram can warn of a weakening move even if MACD lines cross.

7) rsi
- What it measures: Relative Strength Index, momentum oscillator.
- Why it’s suitable: Highlights overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; can reveal divergence with price.
- How to use: Monitor typical 70/30 thresholds and look for bullish/bearish divergences in the context of trend direction. In strong trends, RSI can stay extreme—use other trend signals to filter.

8) atr
- What it measures: Average True Range, a volatility gauge.
- Why it’s suitable: Helps adjust position sizing and stop placement based on current volatility; adds risk management clarity.
- How to use: Use ATR to set wider stops in volatile regimes or tighten in calmer periods; helps interpret the reliability of signals (high ATR with a weak signal may reduce signal quality).

Notes and how I’ll extend analysis once data is available
- I will fetch SPY price data and compute the above indicators for the most recent 180 days (or your preferred look-back). I’ll then produce:
  - A synthesized trend view (short-term to long-term) based on MA/EMA and MACD alignment.
  - Momentum assessment (MACD lines/histogram with RSI divergence).
  - Volatility and risk state (ATR-driven stop guidance and potential position sizing implications).
  - A concise signal map showing where multiple indicators align or conflict (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA with positive MACD and RSI near overbought).
- I’ll also present concrete interpretation guidelines for entry/exit when signals align or diverge, along with a lightweight rule set to avoid false positives.

Next steps
- Please confirm if you’d like me to retry data retrieval now, or if you’d prefer I proceed with a purely framework-driven, non-data-specific interpretation (with hypothetical scenarios) until the data comes back.
- If you have a preferred date range or a target horizon (e.g., intraday, daily, or weekly), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis accordingly.

Key points at a glance (table)
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret signals | Typical use case in SPY context |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | 50-period trend (mid-term) | Price above = bullish bias; price below = bearish bias; look for crossovers | Filter signals from faster indicators; confirm trend direction |
| close_200_sma | 200-period trend (long-term) | Price above = long-term uptrend; below = downtrend; golden/death cross signals | Confirm regime; align trades with long-term trend |
| close_10_ema | 10-period short-term trend | Price/EMA cross indicates short-term momentum shift | Tactical entries/exits; supplement with longer-term signals |
| macd | MACD momentum/gap between EMAs | MACD line cross/above-below zero suggests momentum changes | Core momentum trigger; use with other filters |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Cross of MACD with MACDS strengthens signal, reduces noise | Signal confirmation for MACD-based entries/exits |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence cues | Early warning of momentum weakening or acceleration |
| rsi | Relative Strength momentum | Overbought/oversold thresholds; potential reversals; watch for divergence | Reversal/dip signals, especially when aligned with trend |
| atr | Average True Range (volatility) | Higher ATR = higher volatility; lower ATR = quieter markets | Risk management: stop placement, position sizing, signal reliability context |
