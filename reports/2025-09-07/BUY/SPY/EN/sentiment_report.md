I ran the tool again to fetch SPY Reddit data for 2025-09-07, but I’m hitting a FileNotFoundError from the tool backend. It looks like a runtime/data file issue with the Reddit stock info source rather than an issue with my request. I can retry a few times or proceed with a robust framework now and fill in the Reddit sentiment once the tool is functioning again. Here’s what I can do right now:

What I can deliver now
- A comprehensive, trader-focused framework for SPY sentiment and news analysis that you can fill in as soon as the Reddit data tool is working.
- A detailed methodology for how to interpret social sentiment vs. price action for SPY (the broad market ETF), plus concrete decision aids for traders.
- A ready-to-use Markdown table at the end to organize key findings once data is available.

What I will do once the Reddit tool is working again
- Retrieve day-by-day Reddit sentiment signals for SPY over the past week (and, if possible, the past 7–10 days) and identify:
  - Net sentiment (bullish vs bearish)
  - Top themes (macro data, Fed policy expectations, risk-on/risk-off, sector rotations)
  - Notable Reddit post topics and correlated price moves
  - Sentiment momentum shifts (e.g., sudden spikes in bearish posts after a macro data release)
- Integrate other sources if available (e.g., top headlines, macro news catalysts, ETF flows, options skew) to provide a multi-source sentiment view.
- Produce a granular, day-by-day analysis with implications for traders: short-term trading signals, hedging considerations, and risk management notes.
- Deliver a final, polished long-form report plus the Markdown table of key takeaways.

 interim framework you can expect in the final report
- Executive Summary: Overall sentiment stance and suggested trading implications for SPY in the current week, with caveats about data source limitations.
- Data Sources and Methods: Reddit data (when available), notable alternative sources, sentiment scoring approach, and any quality checks.
- Daily Sentiment Breakdown: For each day in the past week (and surrounding days if data allows), summarize:
  - Sentiment tone (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Dominant topics and why they matter (macro data, Fed commentary, inflation, liquidity)
  - Quick note on price action context (up/down moves, volatility)
- News/Narrative Highlights: Key headlines or threads driving investor sentiment, plus any counterpoints from other outlets.
- Market Context and Causation Analysis: How Reddit sentiment aligns or diverges from price action, index momentum, sector rotations, and macro events.
- Trading Implications and Scenarios:
  - Base case: what the data is suggesting for SPY direction and volatility
  - Alternative scenarios: what would change the signal (e.g., a surprise inflation print, Fed guidance shift)
  - Risk controls: position sizing ideas, stop levels, hedges (e.g., options strategies)
- Key Risks: Data limitations, potential biases in social sentiment, and external risk factors (macro regime, geopolitics, liquidity events).
- Appendix: Data tables, notes on data quality, and glossary.

Proposed next steps (your call)
- If you’d like me to keep trying the Reddit data tool immediately, I can rerun the request and compile the full sentiment report as soon as it returns data.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with the framework now and deliver a complete, publish-ready report once the Reddit feed comes back, with placeholders clearly marked where Reddit data will be inserted.

Markdown table (to organize key points, to be filled once data is available)
- This is a ready-to-fill structure you can paste into the final report and populate with the Reddit/other data.

| Section | What to capture | Data sources | Key questions | Trader implications |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Time window | Past 7–10 days (daily granularity) | Reddit (SPY), other social, headlines | What was the net sentiment each day? What topics dominated? | Aligns with timing for entries/exits; watch sentiment momentum |
| Top themes | Main topics driving chatter | Reddit threads, posts, headlines | Which macro/earnings/fed themes recur? | Identify catalysts for SPY moves; prepare scenarios |
| Sentiment vs. price | Correlation/lead-lag analysis | Reddit sentiment scores, SPY price | Do sentiment spikes precede moves or lag them? | Use as timing signal; avoid overreliance on sentiment alone |
| Volatility signal | Sentiment-related volatility indicators | Price action, implied vol, VIX (if available) | Does sentiment correlate with higher/lower volatility? | Adjust risk exposure when volatility spikes |
| News highlights | Notable events and their sentiment impact | News feeds, Reddit summaries | Which headlines moved sentiment most? | Use as catalysts for trades or hedges |
| Flow indicators | ETF flows, options activity (if accessible) | ETF data sources, options markets | Are there outsized calls vs puts or skew shifts? | Inform hedging/adjustment strategies |
| Risks & biases | Data quality issues | Method notes | What's the potential bias in social sentiment? | Use with caution; diversify data sources |
| Outcome & actions | Clear next steps | All data | What is the recommended trading posture given current signals? | Concrete position ideas with risk controls |

Status update
- I’m ready to retry the Reddit data fetch now if you’d like me to push again. If the tool continues to fail, I’ll proceed with the framework and wait for a data-enabled update, then deliver the completed report with the Reddit-backed findings.

Would you like me to keep retrying the Reddit data fetch for SPY on 2025-09-07, or should I proceed with the framework and deliver the filled-out report as soon as the Reddit data comes through?
