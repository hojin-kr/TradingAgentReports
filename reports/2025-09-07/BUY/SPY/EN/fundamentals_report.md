I attempted to fetch SPY data with the available tools, but two issues came up:

- SPY is an ETF (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust), not a single-issuer company. The insider sentiment and insider transactions tools are designed for public company tickers, so they don’t apply cleanly to ETFs.
- The parallel tool calls returned FileNotFoundError, indicating the data sources behind these tools don’t currently have SPY data accessible in this environment.

What this means for the analysis:
- A true “fundamental” report in the same format (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, insider sentiment/transactions) isn’t directly applicable to SPY as an ETF.
- We can still provide a high-quality, trader-focused view of SPY by focusing on ETF-specific fundamentals (structure, holdings, expense ratio, AUM, liquidity, tracking error, distribution yield) and then, if you want deeper insight, pivot to a major SPY constituent (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, AMZN) to run a full fundamental analysis (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, insider sentiment/transactions) using the provided tools.

Recommended next steps (pick one):
1) ETF-focused overview for SPY (no insider data needed)
   - I’ll compile a trader-focused profile: objective, tracking methodology, typical expense ratio, AUM, liquidity metrics (average daily volume, bid-ask spread context), dividend yield, distribution policy, currency hedging (if any), and notable risks (tracking error, concentration in tech/large-cap stocks, macro sensitivity).
   - I can also summarize the top holdings and their weight ranges if you want a sense of SPY’s exposure.

2) Analyze a SPY constituent (recommended)
   - Choose a representative component ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL). I will fetch quarterly balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow, plus 30-day insider sentiment and insider transactions, to produce a comprehensive fundamental report tailored for traders.
   - This will give you a granular view of a core holding’s fundamentals which often drive SPY’s performance.

3) If you have a data source you want me to use for SPY (or a specific ETF data feed), share it and I’ll integrate it into the report.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, tell me which option you prefer and which ticker you want for the constituent analysis (e.g., AAPL). I’ll generate a detailed, trader-friendly report and include a Markdown table at the end summarizing key points.
