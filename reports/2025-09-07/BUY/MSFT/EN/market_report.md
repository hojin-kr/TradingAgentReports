Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch MSFT data to generate live indicator readings, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t retrieve the current MSFT price series right now. I can still provide a robust, complementary 8-indicator framework tailored for MSFT in 2025, along with guidance on how to use them once data can be pulled successfully. If you want, I can retry data retrieval as soon as the data path is available.

Recommended 8-indicator set for MSFT (2025 context)
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: The 50-period simple moving average; a medium-term trend benchmark.
  - Why suitable for MSFT: Helps confirm the prevailing mid-term trend in a tech/market cycle where MSFT often trades with distinct swing periods driven by earnings, AI/cloud developments, and macro sentiment.
  - Best use: Confirm trend direction; dynamic support/resistance. Look for price above 50SMA for bullish bias; price crossing below can signal a potential pullback.

- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: The 200-period simple moving average; a long-term trend benchmark.
  - Why suitable for MSFT: Screens for secular trend posture (longer-dated shifts in fundamentals or macro regime). Golden/death cross with 50SMA adds confirmation.
  - Best use: Strategic trend confirmation. Use in conjunction with 50SMA for filter: price above both often indicates broad bullish context, below both leans bearish.

- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: The 10-period exponential moving average; a responsive short-term average.
  - Why suitable for MSFT: Captures quick momentum shifts around corporate news cycles (earnings, product launches) and short-term rotations.
  - Best use: Timely entry/exit signals when used with longer-term averages to reduce noise.

- macd
  - What it measures: MACD line derived from EMAs; momentum/size of price move.
  - Why suitable for MSFT: MSFT often exhibits persistent momentum after earnings or big AI/Cloud catalysts; MACD crossovers with divergence can flag trend changes.
  - Best use: Confirm direction with MACD crossing the signal and watch for histogram expansion or contraction as momentum strength changes.

- macds
  - What it measures: MACD Signal line (EMA of MACD line); smoothing for momentum cues.
  - Why suitable for MSFT: Helps reduce false signals from MACD in choppier periods; provides smoother confirmation of momentum shifts.
  - Best use: Use crossovers (MACD vs. MACDS) to trigger trades in conjunction with price structure.

- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD Histogram; momentum strength gap between MACD line and its signal.
  - Why suitable for MSFT: Quick read on momentum acceleration or deceleration, useful around earnings-driven moves.
  - Best use: Divergence or histogram trend changes can precede price reversals or accelerations.

- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index; momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why suitable for MSFT: Helps spot exhaustion or potential reversals around key levels; in a strong uptrend RSI can stay elevated for a while, so use with trend filters.
  - Best use: Look for 70/30 thresholds with additional trend confirmation; beware of RSI staying overbought in persistent uptrends.

- boll_ub (Bollinger Upper Band)
  - What it measures: Upper Bollinger Band using 20-period middle (20SMA) and 2 standard deviations.
  - Why suitable for MSFT: Signals potential overbought conditions or breakout zones during strong up moves; helps assess volatility and breakout risk in cloud/AI-driven rallies.
  - Best use: Use with other indicators to confirm breakouts or reversions; price riding the upper band in an uptrend is common, but a squeeze followed by a band breakout can imply a volatility expansion.

Rationale for this combination
- Coverage: This set blends trend (50SMA, 200SMA), momentum (MACD trio and RSI), immediate price responsiveness (10EMA), and volatility/outside-influence (boll_ub). It avoids redundancy (no overlap like stochastic RSI) while giving a well-rounded read on trend, momentum, and volatility.
- Complementarity: Trend filters (50SMA/200SMA) reduce noise and help interpret MACD/RSI signals in the correct regime; MACD/macd/s histogram provide different granularities of momentum; RSI provides an independent momentum check to flag potential reversals; Bollinger Upper Band adds a volatility/overbought lens during rallies.
- MSFT-specific relevance: In 2025, MSFT is sensitive to AI/Cloud cycle shifts, earnings surprises, and macro risk-on/risk-off phases. The combination above helps you catch longer-term directional bets, confirm momentum around catalysts, and manage risk via volatility context.

How to use this set in practice (illustrative, once data is available)
- Trend bias filter: Confirm price is above the 50SMA and ideally the 200SMA for bullish bias; consider selling/short signals when price trades below both.
- Entry signals: Look for a MACD line cross above its signal line in the context of price above 50SMA, with RSI not in extreme overbought territory (e.g., below 70) and price near or breaking above the Boll_ub on a controlled pullback.
- Momentum confirmation: Validate a MACD histogram expansion (macdh rising) together with a rising RSI (not overbought) to support a stronger move.
- Risk management: Use ATR (not included in the final 8 due to constraint) or price-distance-based stops to account for MSFT's volatility around earnings. If data allows, combine with VWMA for volume-backed confirmation.
- Exit signals: Consider profit-taking or trailing stops if RSI reaches overbought levels while price shows signs of range compression (boll_ub around or price stalling near upper band) and MACD histogram starts to shrink.

Notes
- The 8-indicator set above is designed to minimize redundancy while delivering a balanced view of trend, momentum, and volatility for MSFT in a dynamic 2025 environment.
- I can rerun the data pull and generate live indicator readings as soon as the data access issue is resolved. If you want me to proceed with this, please confirm or provide an alternative data source/date window.

Key points at a glance
- Objective: Capture MSFT’s medium-term trend, short-term momentum, and volatility context with complementary indicators.
- Core signals to monitor: Trend direction (50SMA/200SMA), short-term momentum (10EMA, MACD trio), momentum strength (MACD Histogram, RSI), volatility/ breakout potential (boll_ub).
- Practical usage: Use trend filters to confirm directional bias, MACD/RSI for timing, and Boll_ub for breakout risk assessment; always corroborate with price action and risk controls.
