I tried to fetch data for GOOGL with get_YFin_data from 2024-09-07 to 2025-09-07, but I hit an internal data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError). It looks like the data source isn’t accessible in this environment right now. I can retry the fetch, try an alternative ticker (GOOG or GOOLG), or adjust the date range. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a plan and the indicator set I’ll apply once data is available, so we can start analyzing right away.

Indicator selection plan (up to 8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50 SMA — Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the broader trend and smooths out noise when paired with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: 200 SMA — Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for overall trend confirmation and detecting major trend regimes (golden/death crosses) over a broad horizon.
- close_10_ema: 10 EMA — Short-term momentum and rapid potential entry points. Responds quickly to price changes, useful for catching shifts in momentum when filtered with longer trends.
- macd: MACD — Momentum momentum differences between two EMAs. Signals trend changes and divergence; works well when used with other filters in uncertain or low-volatility environments.
- macds: MACD Signal — The smoothed MACD line. Crossovers with MACD provide actionable signals when used with others to reduce false positives.
- macdh: MACD Histogram — Momentum strength visualization. Helps gauge acceleration/deceleration and can indicate divergences ahead of price action.
- rsi: RSI — Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions. Naturally paired with trend indicators to identify potential reversals or exceptions in strong trends.
- atr: ATR — Volatility measure. Useful for setting buffers, stop-loss levels, and adjusting position sizing in line with current market volatility.

Rationale for suitability (GOOGL context)
- GOOGL tends to exhibit clear trend phases with meaningful drawdown/volatility cycles rather than extreme micro-movements. The combination of 50/200 SMAs provides a stable trend framework, while a 10 EMA adds sensitivity for timing.
- MACD family components give a robust view of momentum shifts and potential trend changes, which can help identify early signals without relying on a single indicator.
- RSI adds a momentum perspective to identify overbought/oversold zones in the context of the prevailing trend (e.g., RSI can stay elevated in strong uptrends; pairing with trend measures helps avoid premature exits).
- ATR adds a practical risk-management layer, helping adapt stop levels and sizing to current volatility, which is particularly valuable for a large-cap stock like GOOGL that experiences episodic volatility spikes.

What I’ll deliver once data is retrieved
- A detailed, nuanced analysis of current trend, momentum, volatility, and risk setup for GOOGL.
- A cross-check framework using the selected indicators to identify actionable entry/exit considerations, along with potential support/resistance zones.
- A concise verdict and a Markdown summary table (see the template at the end) with key takeaways and recommended considerations.

Please choose one of the following to proceed:
1) Retry data fetch now (same GOOGL, or try GOOG/GOOGL if you prefer).
2) Change the date range (e.g., last 6-12 months) or ticker (GOOG vs GOOGL) and try again.
3) Proceed with the prepared indicator plan and I’ll run the analysis as soon as data is accessible.

Sample Markdown table (key points to be populated after data is available)
- Indicator | Category | Purpose | How to use
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Confirm with price action and other indicators
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation | Watch for crossovers with shorter averages
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Use as a timing filter around longer-term trends
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum change signal | Look for crossovers with macds and divergences
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line crossovers | Confirm MACD cross with price or other indicators
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergence cues | Use with histograms for early warning
- rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold and momentum divergence | Use within the context of trend direction
- atr | Volatility | Volatility-based risk management | Set stop levels and adapt position sizing

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry right away using the same GOOGL ticker and a different date range, or switch to GOOG/GOOG (Class C) if you prefer. How would you like to proceed?
