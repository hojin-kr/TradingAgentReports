I ran the data-fetching tools, but all attempts returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the data store or environment for these tools isn’t accessible right now, so I can’t retrieve the insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the latest quarterly statements for GOOGL at the moment.

What I can do next
- Retry now: I can attempt the same set of tool calls again to see if the environment is back online.
- Use an alternative data path: If you’re okay with it, I can proceed with a qualitative, best-effort fundamental framework for Alphabet (GOOGL) based on typical reporting practices (business segments, margins, capital structure, cash flow quality, etc.) and clearly mark where I would need exact figures from the latest filings.
- Narrow the scope: Focus on one or two data sources you care about (e.g., insider sentiment and quarterly income statement) and try to fetch those first to get a partial view.
- Wait and retry: Sometimes these environments recover after a short interval; I can come back and rerun after a few minutes.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry all data fetches now, or
2) Proceed with a qualitative, data-backed framework and clearly note where the latest numbers would be required, or
3) Focus on a subset (e.g., insider sentiment + income statement) and report what I can verify manually if you have a preferred source?
