I tried to fetch Reddit stock data for GOOGL on 2025-09-07, but I hit a backend error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

I don’t have an alternative data source in this session to pull Reddit data from right now. Here are options for moving forward:

What would you like me to do?
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again in a moment if you want me to keep trying.
- Proceed without Reddit data: I can deliver a comprehensive, trader-focused long report using other public signals (e.g., recent Alphabet news, macro context, general social sentiment proxies) and clearly note that Reddit data is unavailable for this run.
- Hybrid approach: I can prepare the full analysis framework and outline, and if the Reddit feed becomes available, I can append the Reddit sentiment section in a follow-up.

If you’d like me to proceed now without Reddit, I can provide:
- A thorough, trader-oriented analysis of GOOGL’s state as of 2025-09-07 using general news and sentiment indicators.
- Insights on how sentiment and news could map to potential trading moves (short-term catalysts, risk factors).
- A structured Markdown report with a final table summarizing key points and potential actions.

Please tell me which path you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
