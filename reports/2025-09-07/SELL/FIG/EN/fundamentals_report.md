I’m having trouble accessing the data tools at the moment. Here’s how we can proceed and what I’ll do once the tools are accessible:

What I attempted
- Sought a comprehensive, up-to-date fundamental report for FIG (ticker: FIG) covering:
  - Company profile and basic financials
  - Income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow (latest quarterly and yearly)
  - Insider sentiment (past 30 days)
  - Insider transactions (past 30 days)
  - Any notable trends, risks, and insights for traders
- Initial step was to fetch data from multiple sources via the provided tools in parallel, but the tool layer returned FileNotFoundError, indicating a possible backend issue or misconfiguration.

Next steps I can take (once the data tools are accessible)
- Retrieve the latest quarterly income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow for FIG (ticker: FIG) from SimFin:
  - get_simfin_income_stmt with freq=quarterly and curr_date=2025-09-07
  - get_simfin_balance_sheet with freq=quarterly and curr_date=2025-09-07
  - get_simfin_cashflow with freq=quarterly and curr_date=2025-09-07
- Retrieve insider sentiment and insider transactions for the past 30 days:
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment with ticker=FIG and curr_date=2025-09-07
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions with ticker=FIG and curr_date=2025-09-07
- Compile a comprehensive report with:
  - Summary of revenue, net income, margins, liquidity, solvency, and cash flow health
  - Year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter trends
  - Insider sentiment tone and notable insider trades (size, direction, counterparties)
  - Potential red flags (one-time items, unusual cash flow, debt levels)
  - A concise trader-focused interpretation, including potential catalysts or risks
  - A Markdown table at the end with key metrics and observations

If you’d like, I can proceed as soon as the data tools return results. Alternatively, if you have any preferences (e.g., focus on liquidity, profitability, or insider activity), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis.

Would you like me to retry data collection now?
