Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for FIG, but I’m running into a backend error (FileNotFoundError) with the Reddit data tool right now. I can’t pull the live Reddit sentiment feed at the moment, but I can still push forward with a detailed framework and interim analysis plan, and I’ll retry the data fetch as soon as the tool is available again.

What I can do now
- Provide a comprehensive structure for the FIG sentiment/news report, including how to interpret social sentiment, key themes to watch, and trading implications.
- Deliver a ready-to-fill Markdown table (Makrdown table) at the end that will organize key points once the Reddit data is retrieved.
- When the Reddit tool is functioning again, I’ll populate the sentiment metrics (daily post counts, polarity, top topics, influencer signals, engagement), correlate with price action, and summarize recent news catalysts.

Provisional plan and what to expect in the full report
1) Executive snapshot
- Quick read on current sentiment direction, notable pivots, and likely near-term catalysts.
- Initial risk/go-to scenarios for traders (bullish, bearish, or neutral setups) based on sentiment & headlines.

2) Daily sentiment analysis (last 7-10 days)
- Post volume per day (indicative of attention level).
- Sentiment polarity per day (positive/neutral/negative scores).
- Top themes and keywords per day (e.g., product announcements, earnings hints, leadership changes, regulatory notes).
- Notable influencers and engagement signals (retail vs. institutional tone, if available).

3) News & events review
- Summary of relevant news (earnings, partnerships, regulatory updates, product announcements) that may have driven sentiment and price moves.
- Any recurring themes or recurring catalysts (e.g., recurring guidance revisions, new pilots, legal/regulatory concerns).

4) Price/sentiment correlation and risk signals
- Any observable lag/lead between sentiment shifts and price moves.
- Identification of overhangs or momentum signals (e.g., spikes in negative sentiment without price decline, potential overreaction).
- Volatility considerations tied to sentiment spikes.

5) Trader-oriented implications
- If sentiment is turning positive with supportive news, potential entry/exit levels and risk controls.
- If sentiment is waning despite neutral/news plateau, cautionary notes and potential wait-for-confirmation signals.
- Scenarios with limited liquidity or outsized volatility and how to manage position sizing.

6) Key takeaways and watchlist
- 3–5 high-probability catalysts to monitor next week.
- What would constitute a buy/hold/sell signal given the sentiment trajectory and news flow.

Proposed Makrdown table structure (fill in once data is available)
| Date | Daily Sentiment (Net) | Post Volume | Top Themes (Keywords) | Major News/Catalysts | Price Action (Close vs Open) | Notable Influencers / Signals | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Positive/Neutral/Negative | N posts | keyword1, keyword2, ... | News item or catalyst | % move or price level | Influencer signal or notable activity | Brief interpretation |

What I need from you
- Would you like me to retry pulling the Reddit data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the non-live portions of the analysis and update you as soon as the Reddit tool comes back up?
- If you have any preference for time windows (e.g., last 5 days vs last 10 days) or if you want me to explicitly include earnings-related sentiment (if FIG recently announced results) in the analysis, tell me and I’ll tailor the sections accordingly.

Next steps if you want me to proceed with the interim plan
- I’ll draft the full report sections based on the framework above, clearly labeling data-derived insights (when available) and noting any data gaps due to the tool issue.
- I’ll supply the table (as shown) ready to fill with the live Reddit data once the tool is functioning again.
- I’ll re-run the Reddit fetch as soon as the backend issue is resolved and append the updated sentiment metrics and business-impact analysis to the report.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or should I continue with the interim draft as described?
