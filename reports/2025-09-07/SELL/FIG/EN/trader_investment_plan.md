Recommendation: SELL FIG now.

Why this aligns with the analysis plan
- Near-term profitability trajectory is uncertain. Top-line growth (even if strong) is not coupled with a clear path to margin expansion or positive free cash flow, making multiple more vulnerable to compression if growth slows or AI monetization underperforms.
- Elevated risk factors remain prominent. Lock-up events (e.g., Sep window) and crypto exposure add headline and macro-driven volatility, which can amplify downside on disappointing data or guidance.
- Valuation support for a rapid profitability inflection is not evident. Without credible 2026 profitability targets or demonstrable margin leverage, the stock is at risk of multiple downgrades if near-term metrics don’t meet expectations.
- Price dynamics suggest risk-reward is skewed to the downside given the uncertainties around near-term profitability and durability of AI-enabled monetization.

Practical actions and risk controls
- If you currently hold FIG, consider trimming or exiting within the next 1–2 weeks. Implement a hard stop (e.g., 15–20% pullback from recent highs or a breach of a near-term support level) and use a trailing stop if price runs briefly in your favor.
- For new or hedged exposure, avoid large outright long bets. Prefer defined-risk strategies (e.g., puts, bear spreads) or small position sizes with strict risk caps to limit downside.
- Monitor key catalysts that could improve the stance (clear 2026 margin/FCF targets, credible AI-driven margin uplift, enterprise deal momentum) and be ready to reassess quickly if those do not materialize.
- Track lock-up timelines and insider/crypto-related risk signals as near-term catalysts; be prepared to adjust exposure proactively around these events.

Conclusion
- The plan’s strongest bear case centers on the lack of near-term profitability clarity and the material event/macroeconomic risks that can weigh on sentiment and multiple valuation. Given these factors, the risk-reward currently favors a cautious to bearish stance, supporting a Sell recommendation for FIG.
