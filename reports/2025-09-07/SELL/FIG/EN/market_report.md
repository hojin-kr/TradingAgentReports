I attempted to fetch FIG data and run the indicator analyses, but the data source returned errors (FileNotFoundError) for both the price data and the indicator reports. Because the underlying CSV/data file isn’t accessible in the current session, I can’t generate the actual indicator values or a live trend report right now.

What you can do next
- Retry data retrieval: I can try again to fetch FIG data from Yahoo Finance (get_YFin_data) for 2024-09-07 to 2025-09-07, or adjust the date range if you prefer.
- Confirm the ticker: FIG is the ticker you want. If FIG trades on a specific exchange (e.g., NYSE or NASDAQ) or uses a different symbol in your data setup, please confirm so I fetch the correct data.
- If data continues to fail: I can proceed with a structured analysis plan using placeholders or a separate data source you approve, or I can analyze related peers/sector until FIG data is accessible.

Indic indicators I plan to use (8 indicators, chosen for complementary coverage)
- Moving Averages:
  - close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average for mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average for long-term trend confirmation and major trend context (golden/death cross checks).
  - close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average to capture short-term momentum and quick shifts (signal with caution in choppy markets).
- MACD Related:
  - macd: MACD line to identify momentum and potential trend changes via crossovers/divergence.
  - macds: MACD Signal line for crossovers with MACD as trade signals; helps reduce false positives when used with other filters.
  - macdh: MACD Histogram to visualize momentum strength and early divergence signals.
- Momentum:
  - rsi: RSI for momentum extremes and potential reversals (watch for divergence in trends; thresholds 70/30).
- Volatility:
  - atr: ATR to gauge volatility for stop placement and risk management.

Rationale for these choices
- They cover three layers of insight: trend direction (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum (MACD family), and risk/volatility (ATR) along with a momentum oscillator (RSI). This combination provides a balanced view: trend confirmation, momentum signals, and volatility/risk management, with minimal redundancy.

What I’ll deliver once data is accessible
- A detailed, nuanced report describing:
  - Trend context: where price sits relative to 50/200 SMA and any recent crossovers (golden/death cross tendencies).
  - Momentum signals: MACD crossovers, histogram strength, and RSI behavior (overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences).
  - Short-term dynamics: 10 EMA behavior relative to price and other moving averages to spot quick entry/exit windows.
  - Volatility and risk: ATR-driven considerations for stop placement and position sizing.
  - Scenario-based trading ideas: what the indicators imply for potential long/short ideas with contingency notes for false signals in low-volatility or range-bound markets.
- A compact, trader-friendly synthesis with concrete observations and caveats for FIG.

Markdown table: key points (to be populated with real data once available)
| Indicator | What it measures | Why it's included | What to watch ( FIG context ) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Core trend filter; controls bias | Price above/below 50 SMA; potential pullbacks to SMA as entries or exits |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms primary trend, major cross signals | Price position relative to 200 SMA; monitor for golden/death cross signals |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Captures quick shifts, responsive signal | Crosses with price or other EMAs; watch for noise in range-bound markets |
| macd | Momentum via MACD line | Core momentum signal; trend-change indicator | Crossover with MACD signal, divergence against price action |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoother momentum confirmation | Crosses with MACD line; strengthens signals when aligned with price |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength visualization | Increasing/decreasing histogram; potential early divergence cues |
| rsi | Momentum strength / overbought-oversold | Divergence and extremes tool | Readings near 70/30; watch for bullish/bearish divergences in context |
| atr | Price volatility level | Risk management and stop placement basis | Rising ATR -> wider stops; falling ATR -> tighter risk posts; use with position sizing |

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now. Please confirm:
  - The ticker is indeed FIG with the exchange you intend (e.g., NYSE/NASDAQ) and that “FIG” is the correct symbol in this environment.
  - If you have a preferred date range or if I should stick with 2024-09-07 to 2025-09-07 as before.
- Alternatively, you can provide a CSV or permit me to use a different data source, and I’ll proceed with the eight indicators and deliver the full trend report with the Markdown table.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll retry or adapt as soon as the data source is accessible.
