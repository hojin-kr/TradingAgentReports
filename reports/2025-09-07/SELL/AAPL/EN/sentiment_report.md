Thanks. I tried to fetch Reddit stock info for AAPL on 2025-09-07, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the Reddit data source is currently not accessible on my end. I can’t pull that Reddit sentiment data right now.

What I can do next (options):
- Option 1: Retry in a bit or with a different date if you want me to keep trying for Reddit data when the tool is back online.
- Option 2: Proceed with a comprehensive analysis using other sources I can access (e.g., general company news, public sentiment from non-Reddit sources, and recent filings/press). If you want this, I can compile a detailed qualitative and (where possible) quantitative view, but I’ll need to rely on sources other than Reddit until the Reddit tool is fixed.
- Option 3: Prepare the full long report framework now, and once the Reddit tool is functional, we fill in the Reddit-specific sentiment and day-by-day breakdown and deliver a complete report alongside the structure.

What I can deliver immediately:
- A robust framework for a long-form Apple (AAPL) social sentiment and news analysis, including the exact sections, key questions to answer, and how I’d present the data.
- A ready-to-fill Markdown table template at the end of the report for organizing key points and findings.

If you’d like me to proceed now with the framework, here’s what the final report will cover:
- Executive snapshot: Overall mood around AAPL over the past week, with a focus on notable turning points.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: Bullish/neutral/bearish sentiment per day, weighted scores, and any spikes tied to specific topics (e.g., iPhone cycle, services growth, AI announcements, supply chain news).
- News heatmap: 7 days of headlines from Apple-related feeds (business news, tech news, policy/regulatory, consumer sentiment) with quick implications for price drivers.
- Topic analysis: Major themes driving sentiment (product launches, services growth, margin/ERP changes, China/exports, regulatory risk, stock buyback/news about capital allocation).
- Quantitative signals (when available): correlation of sentiment with intraday price moves, volume spikes, options data cues if accessible.
- Risk and catalysts: Key risks (supply chain, demand cycles, regulatory risk) and upcoming catalysts (product events, earnings, guidance, 5G/AI adoption mentions).
- Trader implications: How sentiment shifts could influence short-term moves, entry/exit considerations, and potential trade ideas (e.g., event-driven bets around product launches or earnings).

Proposed Markdown table structure (to append at the end of the final report)
- Date
- Source
- Sentiment_Label (Bullish/Neutral/Bearish)
- Sentiment_Score (e.g., -1.0 to +1.0)
- Key_Topics/Topics
- Notable_Impact_on_AAPL
- Notes/Uncertainties

Please tell me which path you’d like:
- Retry Reddit data later (Option 1)
- Proceed with non-Reddit sources only (Option 2)
- Go ahead with the framework now and fill in Reddit data when available (Option 3)

If you want me to proceed with Option 2 or Option 3, I’ll start outlining the full report and prepare the Markdown table template right away.
