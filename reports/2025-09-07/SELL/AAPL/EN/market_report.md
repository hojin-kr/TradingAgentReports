Sorry—I'm running into an issue fetching the data from the data source right now. The get_YFin_data call is returning a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have actual price data for AAPL to compute and confirm the indicators at the moment. I’ll outline a solid, complementary indicator setup (8 indicators) you can use once the data fetch is working, and I’ve also included a detailed interpretation framework you can apply immediately when the data is available.

Selected indicators (max 8, diverse and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: The 50-period simple moving average, a medium-term trend indicator acting as dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why suitable for AAPL: Helps confirm intermediate trend direction and tolerance for pullbacks. Useful for filtering noise from short-term moves.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: The 200-period simple moving average, a long-term trend benchmark.
  - Why suitable for AAPL: Identifies longer-term regime (bullish/bearish) and potential golden/death cross signals when combined with shorter MA signals.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: The 10-period exponential moving average, a responsive short-term trend/momentum proxy.
  - Why suitable for AAPL: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry/exit dynamics; helps with timing when used with the longer SMAs.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: Momentum via the difference between two EMAs (fast vs slow) and its convergence/divergence.
  - Why suitable for AAPL: Broadly tracks momentum crossovers and trend strength; helpful in confirming signals from price/MA interactions.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD).
  - Why suitable for AAPL: Crossovers of MACD with the signal line provide additional confirmation for trades suggested by MACD and price action.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD histogram, the gap between MACD and its signal line.
  - Why suitable for AAPL: Visualizes momentum strength and potential divergence early; useful to gauge momentum shifts when MACD is ambiguous.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index, momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why suitable for AAPL: Helps identify potential reversals or continuations when momentum is extreme; complements trend indicators by signaling possible pullbacks.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it measures: Average True Range, a measure of price volatility.
  - Why suitable for AAPL: Helpful for setting stop levels and sizing positions; rising ATR suggests expanding volatility which can affect risk management and entry/exit dynamics.

Rationale for choosing these indicators (complementary and non-redundant)
- Trend direction and frame: close_50_sma, close_200_sma, and close_10_ema provide a layered view of trend across time horizons (short, mid, long). This helps you gauge whether AAPL is in a prevailing uptrend, downtrend, or choppy regime.
- Momentum confirmation: macd, macds, and macdh together give a multi-faceted view of momentum strength, potential reversals, and divergence signals. They help avoid relying on a single indicator’s crossovers.
- Momentum extremes and risk: RSI gives overbought/oversold context to momentum readings, while ATR informs about current volatility. This pairing helps balance potential entries with risk management.
- Avoiding redundancy: I’ve avoided including both stochastic measures and RSI (which are both momentum/pullback oscillators) to prevent redundant signals. The chosen RSI, MACD suite, and MA framework cover momentum, trend, and volatility without overlapping signals.

What I’ll do once data retrieval is working
- I will fetch the price data for AAPL for the requested window, compute the 8 indicators above, and deliver:
  - A detailed narrative describing current alignment or misalignment among trend, momentum, and volatility indicators.
  - Specific scenarios showing potential entry/exit implications given different indicator configurations (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA with MACD bullish cross and RSI in a neutral zone).
  - Any notable divergences (e.g., MACD histogram divergence, RSI divergence) and their potential implications.
  - A risk-aware interpretation that accounts for current volatility via ATR.

Proposed next steps
- Retry the data retrieval (get_YFin_data) to obtain the needed price history for AAPL. If the file/path issue persists, we can switch to an alternate data source or run a minimal placeholder analysis once we have any data points.
- After data is retrieved, I’ll run the 8 indicators, generate a detailed trend report, and append a Markdown table summarizing the key insights (as requested).

Markdown table: Key indicators and interpretations (to be filled with actual data once available)
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret for AAPL | Signals to watch (example) | Caveats |
|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | | | Lagging; use with faster indicators |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; major trend benchmark | | | Slow to react; best for strategic context |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; quick shifts | | | Prone to noise in choppy markets |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum crossovers/divergence | | | Crossovers should be confirmed by other signals |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line | | | Crossovers are less reliable in isolation |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength; divergence potential | | | Can be volatile in fast markets |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum; overbought/oversold | | | In strong trends, can stay overbought/oversold longer |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Price volatility; risk management | | | Reactive; use for stop placement and sizing |

Important note
- I’m ready to proceed with the 8-indicator setup and provide a comprehensive, data-backed trend analysis as soon as the data fetch succeeds. If you’d like, I can also adjust the indicator set (e.g., swap out RSI for Bollinger-based measures or add VWMA) depending on your preferred trading style or risk tolerance.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with a provisional plan and adjust once the data comes back? If you have an alternate data source or a specific date range you’d like prioritized, share that and I’ll adapt.
