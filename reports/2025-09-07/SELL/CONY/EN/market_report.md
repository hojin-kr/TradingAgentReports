Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch the data for CONY, but the data retrieval service returned an error (FileNotFoundError) on both the initial price data request and the subsequent indicator calls. That means I don’t currently have live price data to produce a fresh, signal-based readout. I can proceed in two ways:

- Option A: Retry data fetch now and provide a full, data-driven analysis with the 8 selected indicators.
- Option B: Proceed with a robust, rules-based framework and interpretation guidance using typical CONY-styled market behavior, ready to run the moment data becomes available.

If you’d like me to retry, say “Retry data fetch.” If you’d prefer I proceed with the framework and interpretation now, say “Proceed with framework.” In the meantime, here is a focused set of 8 indicators I’ll use (once data is available) and why they provide complementary insights without redundancy.

Selected indicators (8 total) and why they’re suitable for CONY
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Provides the medium-term trend direction and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful for identifying trend camouflage and potential pullbacks.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm the overarching regime (bullish vs bearish) and can flag golden/death cross setups when crossovers occur with shorter averages.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. A responsive short-term momentum gauge. Helps with quicker entry/exit horizons and catching shifts that longer averages may lag on.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum indicator based on EMA differences. Signals trend changes via crossovers, zero-line crossing, and divergence considerations.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoothing of MACD. Crossovers between MACD and MACDS provide additional confirmation to avoid false signals.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential. Helps assess the pace of momentum changes and can alert to waning/burgeoning momentum ahead of crossovers.
- rsi: RSI. Relative strength gauge for momentum, with common oversold/overbought thresholds (e.g., 30/70) and potential divergences signaling reversals.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility; essential for sizing, stop levels, and understanding how much price can move in a given period. Helps manage risk and avoid premature exits in volatile regimes.

How these indicators complement each other
- Trend confirmation: close_50_sma and close_200_sma give a layered view of trend strength and regime. A bullish tilt (price above both SMAs with 50 above 200) strengthens long-side bias, while a bearish tilt (price below both, or a 50/200 death cross) strengthens short-side bias.
- Momentum timing: macd, macds, and macdh provide a three-layer momentum read. Crossovers (MACD vs MACDS) plus histogram dynamics help filter false positives in choppy markets, while RSI adds a momentum-check with overbought/oversold context.
- Entry/exit discipline: The 10 EMA adds a quicker signal line to help time entries or exits when used with the longer-term trend context from the SMAs and the MACD-based momentum confirmation.
- Volatility-aware risk: ATR informs position sizing and stop placement, ensuring that risk aligns with current market volatility. This is especially valuable in CONY’s environment if volatility spikes occur around key events or earnings.

Interpreting signals in a CONY context (framework you can apply once data is available)
- Trend rules
  - Bullish: price above 50SMA and 200SMA, with 50SMA above 200SMA; consider long-biased strategies if MACD also shows bullish momentum.
  - Bearish: price below 50SMA and 200SMA, with 50SMA below 200SMA; consider short-biased or hedging strategies if MACD confirms direction.
- Momentum signals
  - MACD cross above the signal line (MACD > MACDS) and positive histogram (MACDH rising) support long entries when aligned with bullish trend; reverse for short entries.
  - RSI rising above midline (e.g., >50) strengthens a bullish bias; RSI failing to break higher in a strong uptrend may indicate weakening momentum and potential pullbacks.
- Volatility and risk
  - ATR rising signals higher expected price movement; if volatility spikes, consider wider stops and/or smaller position sizing to manage risk.
  - In consolidations, expect MACD/histogram to contract while RSI flags potential divergences; this often precedes a breakout in whichever direction momentum reasserts.

Next steps
- If you want, I can retry the data pull now and then generate a current, signal-based report using these 8 indicators.
- If you prefer not to wait, I can deliver a detailed, rules-based interpretation framework (as above) tailored to CONY that you can apply as soon as data becomes available, plus a ready-to-use checklist for entries/exits and risk management.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | Purpose | What to look for (signal interpretation) | How it helps for CONY |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Price above/below 50SMA; 50SMA relative to 200SMA | Confirms trend direction and potential support/resistance zones |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Price above/below 200SMA; cross with 50SMA (golden/death cross) | Establishes regime; aids strategic bias alignment |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price/behavior around 10EMA; cross with price | Early entry/exit timing; captures quick shifts |
| macd | Momentum trend changes | MACD crossovers, zero-line crossings, divergence | Signals trend change confirmation with MACDS/macdh |
| macds | Smoothing of MACD signal | Crosses with MACD, momentum confirmation | Reduces false positives for entries/exits |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction, positive/negative bars | Early warning of momentum acceleration/decay |
| rsi | Momentum strength and extremes | RSI near/overbought (>70) or oversold (<30); divergences | Helps anticipate reversals or continuations within trend |
| atr | Volatility and risk | Rising/falling ATR; position sizing and stops | Aligns risk management with current volatility, improves stop placement |

Important note
- Data retrieval for CONY is currently unavailable in the session. If you’d like, I can retry immediately or proceed with the framework and an interpretation guide that you can apply once data returns. Please tell me which option you prefer.
