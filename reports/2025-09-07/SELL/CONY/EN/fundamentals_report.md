I attempted to fetch CONY’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the latest quarterly financials, but the data tools returned a FileNotFoundError in the current environment. It looks like the data service files aren’t accessible right now. I can retry the data pulls immediately, or proceed with a structured qualitative report using placeholder or historical context if you’d prefer. Let me know which you prefer. In the meantime, here’s a comprehensive report framework you can expect once the data pulls succeed, plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table at the end.

What I plan to deliver (once data is available)
- Company profile and profile-driven context
- Latest financial snapshot (quarterly) including income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow
- Financial history highlights (revenue, earnings, margins, liquidity, leverage)
- Cash flow quality assessment (operating cash flow vs. net income, seasonality, capex)
- Insider activity overview (insider sentiment and insider transactions over the past 30 days)
- Trading-relevant insights and risk factors for traders
- Key takeaways and potential catalysts or red flags
- Append a Markdown table summarizing the key points

Notes about the data streams
- Insider sentiment (past 30 days): qualitative sentiment indicators from public filings (buys vs sells, tone, notable insiders)
- Insider transactions (past 30 days): counts, sizes, and notable patterns of insider purchases/sales
- Balance sheet (quarterly): assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity ratios
- Cash flow (quarterly): operating, investing, financing cash flows; free cash flow implications
- Income statement (quarterly): revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, margins
- All items will be tied to the current date you provided (2025-09-07) and focused on the most recent quarter available, with QoQ and YoY context where possible

Proposed structure of the final report
- Executive snapshot: core numbers and quick interpretation
- Company profile: business model, segments, geographic exposure, competitive landscape
- Profitability: gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROE, ROA, and drivers
- Top-line trend: revenue growth drivers, mix by product/region (if disclosed)
- Cost structure and margin analysis: cost of goods sold, operating expenses, margin compression/enhancement
- Balance sheet health: liquidity (current ratio, quick ratio), leverage (debt/equity, interest coverage), asset quality
- Cash flow quality: operating cash flow vs. net income, capex intensity, free cash flow
- Insider perspective: sentiment signals and transactional activity, potential signals for future moves
- Risk factors and catalysts: competitive, regulatory, macro, and company-specific risks
- Trader-oriented takeaways: estimated impact on volatility, potential catalysts (earnings, product launches, regulatory decisions)
- Appendices: data sources, methodology, and limitations

Markdown table (ready to populate once data is available)
- I’m including a blank scaffold so you can see how the final table will be organized and easily filled in.

Next steps
- I can retry all five data pulls immediately and then populate the full report with concrete numbers and analyses. Would you like me to retry now?
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative outline now (without exact figures) and fill in numbers as soon as the data tools come back online.
- If you want to adjust the scope (e.g., include annual figures in addition to quarterly, or extend the lookback window beyond 30 days for insider data), tell me and I’ll tailor the report.

Please confirm:
- Retry now, or
- Use a fallback qualitative outline (no numbers until data is available), or
- Change ticker/date scope (e.g., a different date or include annual data).
