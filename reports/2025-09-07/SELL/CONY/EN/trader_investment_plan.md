Recommendation summary
- SELL now (trim exposure and tighten risk controls). Reassess on clear, verifiable progress toward profitability and deleveraging.

Rationale
- The bear case presents near-term, material risks: cash burn and runway constraints in a tightening macro environment, potential margin pressure from competition, and the possibility that TAM expansion does not quickly translate into durable profitability. These headwinds threaten downside if catalysts stall.
- While the bull thesis remains plausible, it hinges on multiple uncertain factors (accelerating revenue, monetization across geos/verticals, pricing power, and a credible path to profitability). Given current price and risk, de-risking now offers better downside protection than chasing uncertain upside.
- The plan’s emphasis on re-entry only after tangible profitability and liquidity improvements aligns with prudent risk management and capital preservation.

Concrete actions (start now)
- Immediate position action
  - Trim CONY to roughly 25-50% of your prior exposure (or to 0.25x–0.5x of your original position), based on your risk budget.
  - If using margin, reassess and tighten/disable leverage to avoid forced liquidation on volatility.
  - Implement a hard stop using ATR-based sizing (e.g., 1.5–2x the current ATR) or a defined percentage drop (roughly 8–12%), whichever aligns with your risk tolerance.
- Hedging and overlays
  - Consider a protective hedge (e.g., a put option collar) to cap downside while retaining some upside if you wish to stay partially exposed.
- Monitoring checklist (data to watch)
  - Burn rate and runway: quarterly cash burn, liquidity headroom, and debt maturities/refinancing options.
  - Monetization progress: product adoption, cross-sell velocity, geographic milestones, and gross margin trends.
  - Macro/sector cues: rate expectations, liquidity conditions, and enterprise IT budgets affecting CONY’s customers.
  - Re-entry triggers: credible, trackable path to free cash flow, margin expansion, and stabilized liquidity; positive multi-quarter monetization signals.
- Re-entry framework
  - Re-enter only if: (a) a credible FCF path is visible within a defined horizon, (b) liquidity runway is extended/stabilized, and (c) durable monetization and pricing power are evidenced across multiple geos/verticals.
  - Use data-driven triggers (e.g., sustained gross margin improvement, controlled cash burn, and clear monetization milestones) before stepping back into a full position.
- Portfolio hygiene
  - Reallocate capital to opportunities with clearer near-term cash-flow visibility or stronger liquidity cushions. If growth exposure remains desired, prioritize names with shorter paths to profitability.

Notes on decision framework
- Maintain capital discipline: use explicit risk controls (stops, position sizing) and avoid relying on a single signal or narrative.
- Be prepared for quick re-evaluation if new data shows a credible, durable profitability path or if liquidity conditions improve meaningfully.

Target outcome
- If you want precise levels for your portfolio, share current CONY price, liquidity, and your risk budget and I’ll tailor exact trim sizes and re-entry triggers. For now, the recommended stance remains SELL with a disciplined plan to re-enter only on verified profitability and liquidity progress.
