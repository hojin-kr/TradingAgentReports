Sorry about that — the Reddit stock info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError and isn’t delivering data for CONY right now. I can’t fetch the latest social sentiment or news until that tool is operational again. If you’d like, I can retry in a moment or proceed with a thorough framework and methodology now, so we’re ready to produce the full report as soon as the data comes in.

What I can do right now
- Outline a comprehensive, trader-focused long report framework for CONY that will be filled with real data as soon as the data source (Reddit/social sentiment tool) is accessible.
- Provide a detailed plan of the metrics, sources, and actionable insights I’ll extract, plus a Makrdown table at the end to organize key points.

Proposed report structure (to be filled with data once the tool is back)
- Executive snapshot
  - Summary of sentiment trend (daily and weekly), notable spikes, and any correlation with price moves.
  - Quick take on whether sentiment is leaning bullish, bearish, or neutral.
- Data sources and methodology
  - Social sentiment: Reddit threads (CONY), X/Twitter, StockTwits, and other major forums.
  - News and price data: latest company announcements, earnings cadence, regulatory updates, macro factors.
  - Sentiment scoring: how polarity and volume are calculated (e.g., 0-1 scale for positivity, negative posts count, engagement metrics).
- Weekly sentiment deep-dive
  - Day-by-day sentiment scores and post volumes for the last 7 days.
  - Top themes by frequency (e.g., product news, partnerships, earnings, supply chain, guidance).
  - Most influential posts (high engagement, early movers) and what they imply.
- News and catalysts recap
  - Any company announcements, press releases, earnings calls, guidance changes, or regulatory updates from the past week.
  - Market reaction to each catalyst (price and volume change, volatility spikes).
- Price-action and sentiment correlation
  - Correlation analysis between sentiment shifts and intraday/close-to-close price moves.
  - Key support/resistance levels to watch in the context of sentiment trend.
- Risk factors and counterpoints
  - Sentiment-driven risk (e.g., overhyped enthusiasm, rumor-driven moves, potential for a reversal).
  - Fundamental vs. sentiment misalignment risks.
- Trading implications and ideas
  - Short-term (intraday to 1-2 weeks): potential entry/exit triggers, volume/volatility cues.
  - Medium-term (2-8 weeks): sentiment mean-reversion expectations, catalysts to watch.
  - Risk controls: position sizing, stop levels, and news-event risk guards.
- Key takeaways
  - What has shifted most in the last week and what that means for traders.
- Appendices (optional)
  - Data caveats, sources, and any limitations of the sentiment model.

What I need from you or what will happen next
- I can retry the Reddit/social sentiment data fetch immediately or at a later time you prefer. If you want me to retry now, say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt again and deliver the full report with the Makrdown table at the end.
- If you’d rather proceed with a qualitative, data-less analysis for now (based on typical patterns and constraints), I can present a provisional framework and example interpretations, clearly labeled as illustrative until the data arrives.

Makrdown table outline (to appear at the end of the final report)
- A structured summary of key points, e.g.:
  - Section: Sentiment (Last 7 days)
    - Key datapoints (e.g., avg polarity, volume, notable spike dates)
  - Section: News/Catalysts (Last 7 days)
    - Summary of catalysts and market reaction
  - Section: Price-Sentiment Link
    - Correlation and notable instances
  - Section: Trading Implications
    - Short-term view, medium-term view, risk controls
  - Section: Risk Flags
    - Potential pitfalls or misalignments

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now and then deliver the full, finalized report with the Makrdown table as soon as the tool responds?
