I attempted to fetch HOOD data with get_YFin_data for 2024-09-07 to 2025-09-07, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a temporary data-fetching issue or path/config problem on the data service side. I can try again now, switch the date range, or proceed with a qualitative/structure-only analysis until data retrieval succeeds. Please tell me which you prefer.

In the meantime, I’ll lay out a robust, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators tailored for HOOD (a highly volatile, sentiment-driven fintech name). The goal is to provide complementary insights across trend, momentum, volatility, and volume, without overlapping signals.

Selected indicators (eight total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these are suitable for HOOD
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Provide mid- and long-term trend context. HOOD tends to exhibit regime shifts (trend re-ignition after pullbacks); 50 SMA helps identify intermediate trend direction, while 200 SMA helps gauge the broader regime and potential golden/death-cross context.
- close_10_ema: Captures short-term momentum and faster price shifts, useful for timing entries/exits in a choppy, sentiment-driven stock like HOOD where quick reactions can matter.
- macd, macds, macdh: Offer a cohesive momentum framework:
  - macd gives the primary momentum signal via crossovers with the MACD line.
  - macds (MACD Signal) provides smoother crossovers to reduce false entries.
  - macdh (MACD Histogram) shows momentum divergence strength and trend acceleration/deceleration.
- rsi: Momentum/overbought-oversold gauge. In volatile names like HOOD, RSI can remain extreme for extended periods during strong moves; use it with trend context from the moving averages.
- atr: Quantifies current volatility and helps with risk management (position sizing, stop placements). HOOD’s daily moves can be sizable; ATR helps set dynamic risk parameters aligned with realized volatility.

What I’ll do once data retrieval works
- Compute the eight indicators on HOOD using the retrieved price history.
- Produce a nuanced, date-stamped readout that covers:
  - Trend alignment across 10-EMA, 50-SMA, 200-SMA
  - Momentum signals from MACD/Signal/Histogram
  - RSI levels and potential reversals/divergences
  - Volatility context from ATR
  - Any notable confluences or divergences among momentum and trend signals
  - Practical trading considerations (entries, exits, stop placement, risk management) tailored to HOOD’s typical behavior
- Provide a concise, trader-focused interpretation with actionable notes and caveats (e.g., sensitivity to market sentiment, earnings-driven moves, and liquidity considerations).

Proposed next steps
- Option A: Retry data fetch now (I’ll re-attempt get_YFin_data for HOOD with the same or a revised date range) and then run the eight indicators for a detailed report.
- Option B: Retry with a shorter lookback (e.g., 365 days or 180 days) to increase the chance of successful retrieval and provide a more immediate context.
- Option C: Proceed with a qualitative, rules-based framework using the eight indicators as described, but without fresh data, to outline potential setups HOOD traders could monitor when data becomes available.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry the data fetch now, or
2) Use a shortened date range, or
3) Proceed with a qualitative, non-data-driven outline using these indicators?

Appendix: quick-reference table of the chosen indicators and their roles (for your quick view)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark and regime context
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum and quick shift signals
- macd: Momentum change via EMA differences; cue for trend changes
- macds: MACD signal line; helps filter MACD crossovers
- macdh: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence visual
- rsi: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold flags
- atr: Volatility level for risk management and stop sizing

Markdown table: key points and usage (draft until we have actual data)
| Indicator | Category | What it signals for HOOD | Practical usage notes |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend direction | Use with 10-EMA crossovers for entries; check alignment with 200-SMA for regime context |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend/signal of regime | Golden/death-cross considerations; use for strategic bias checks |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum shifts | Early entry/exit signal; filter false moves with longer MA trend |
| macd | MACD | Momentum changes / trend inflection | Look for crossovers with MACD line; confirm with RSI and trend direction |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoother momentum confirmation | Use crossovers with MACD line to trigger signals with less noise |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence | Positive/negative histogram and changes signal momentum shifts |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context, potential reversals | Watch for divergences; in strong trends RSI can stay extreme; use with trend filters |
| atr | Volatility | Current market volatility and risk context | Use for stop placement and position sizing; adjust risk per volatility regime |

If you’d like, I’ll retry the data fetch immediately and proceed with the full eight-indicator analysis as soon as the data is available.
