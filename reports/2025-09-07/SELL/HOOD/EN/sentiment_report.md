I hit a tool error trying to pull Reddit stock-sentiment data for HOOD. The multi-tool run returned FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the Reddit sentiment feed to incorporate right now. I can either:

- Retry the Reddit data fetch later, or
- Proceed with a thorough analysis using non-Reddit sources (news, filings, press releases, macro context, and general market sentiment) and clearly label where Reddit data would be added once available.

If you’d like me to proceed now with non-Reddit sources, here’s how I can structure the long report and start filling in content:

Proposed structure for HOOD (Robinhood Markets) sentiment, news, and fundamentals (last week context)
1) Executive snapshot
- Quick read on the current state: price action context, volatility, and notable catalysts from the past week.
- Key risk factors and potential catalysts for the next 1–2 weeks.

2) News and catalysts (recent week)
- Summarize recent company/news items: earnings commentary, regulatory updates, product changes (e.g., crypto offering, account features), partnerships, or legal/regulatory developments.
- Map each item to potential impact on sentiment and price (short-term vs. longer-term).

3) Public sentiment (qualitative, using available sources)
- General mood from mainstream outlets and investor communications.
- Thematic signals to watch (e.g., user growth vs. churn cues, monetization progress, crypto revenue volatility, competitive landscape, and regulatory scrutiny).
- Note: I’ll explicitly mark where Reddit sentiment would be integrated once the Reddit data tool is functioning.

4) Market context and drivers
- Macro factors affecting brokerages and fintechs (interest rate environment, growth vs. profitability expectations, capex on technology, crypto market cycles).
- Sector peer landscape (how HOOD compares to peers in user growth, revenue mix, and margins).

5) Sentiment vs. fundamentals analysis
- Correlation and potential divergences between sentiment signals and fundamentals (GMV, active users, revenue per user, take rate, crypto exposure).
- Short-term tactical implications for traders (range expectations, potential breakout/breakdown levels, and risk factors).

6) Risks and opportunities for traders
- Key upside catalysts (e.g., regulatory clarity, product enhancements driving engagement, crypto recovery if applicable).
- Key downside risks (regulatory changes, platform outages, competitive pressure, execution challenges).

7) Tactical takeaways
- If short-term trading handles: what to watch (volume spikes, option activity hints, intraday volatility).
- If longer-term positioning: what fundamentals would need to improve to justify a stance.

8) Appendix: data sources and notes
- List of sources used (news outlets, filings, company announcements). Clearly flag where Reddit data would be added.

Would you like me to start with this non-Reddit-based analysis now? If you approve, I’ll draft the first full section (Executive snapshot and News & Catalysts) and then iteratively fill in the sentiment sections as sources come in. If you prefer, I can instead retry the Reddit data tool first and then proceed with the composite report.
