I’m seeing a tool error right now when fetching Reddit stock info for META on 2025-09-07 (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). It looks like a temporary issue with the data tool.

What I can do next (your call):
- Retry fetching the Reddit sentiment data now and proceed with the full analysis as soon as it succeeds.
- If the tool keeps failing, switch to a best-effort qualitative analysis using available public news and any other sentiment signals I can access, then combine that with a structured framework for traders (without the Reddit feed).

Proposed plan for the full report (once data fetch works or with alternative sources):
- Daily sentiment sweep over the past week for META from Reddit (top threads, sentiment polarity, key themes like AI/privacy/advertising, earnings/guidance remarks, product/news catalysts).
- Public news analysis (major headlines, earnings/news catalysts, regulatory/regulatory tech issues, platform changes—reels, ads, AI initiatives).
- Sentiment vs price/volatility cues (brief correlation assessment, notable divergences).
- Key drivers and risk factors for traders (short-term catalysts, long-term themes).
- Tactical take and scenarios (bullish/bearish/trade ideas) with actionable signals.
- A concise markdown table at the end summarizing the themes, signals, and potential catalysts.

Questions to tailor this to you:
- Do you want the analysis strictly limited to Reddit data, or should I include other public sentiment sources if Reddit data is unavailable?
- Do you prefer a raw daily breakdown (7 days) or a weekly snapshot with notable spikes highlighted?

If you’d like, I can kick off a retry now and proceed with the detailed analysis as soon as the tool returns data.
