Apologies — I hit a data retrieval issue on the META request. The Yahoo Finance data fetch (get_YFin_data) returned a FileNotFoundError for the date range 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-07. I can retry the data pull, but I wanted to lay out the plan and the exact indicators I’ll run once the data is accessible, so you have a clear path forward.

What I plan to do once data is retrievable
- Retrieve META price data for 2024-09-01 through 2025-09-07 (or the latest available window if that range is blocked).
- Compute up to 8 complementary indicators from the allowed list to avoid redundancy and provide diverse insights:
  - close_50_sma
  - close_200_sma
  - close_10_ema
  - macd
  - macds
  - rsi
  - boll
  - atr
- Generate a detailed, nuanced report detailing trend direction, momentum shifts, volatility regimes, and key support/resistance dynamics, with actionable observations for trading decisions.
- Include a concise, easy-to-scan summary and a Markdown table outlining the key takeaways and interpretation guidelines for META under current conditions.

Selected indicators and why they are suitable (8 total)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm trend alongside faster signals.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend backdrop and macro alignment (golden/death cross context). Good for strategic framing, not overtrading.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum and quick shifts; useful for timely entries when filtered with longer trends.
- macd: Momentum trend changes via EMA differences; primary signal generator when combined with MACD Signal.
- macds: Smoothing of MACD line; crossovers with MACD provide clearer signal timing.
- rsi: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold cues; useful for potential reversals when aligned with trend.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a dynamic baseline for price movement; helps frame breakout or reversal contexts with bands for confirmation.
- atr: Measures volatility, informing risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and volatility-driven regime shifts.

Next steps and how I’ll present the final report
- Once data retrieval succeeds, I’ll deliver:
  - A detailed narrative of META’s trend, momentum, volatility, and risk context over the chosen window.
  - Specific observations such as:
    - Whether price is respecting or breaking major SMAs (50/200) and what that implies for trend sustainability.
    - MACD/macd-histogram signals: crossovers, divergences, and momentum strength changes.
    - RSI readings and any meaningful divergences with price action.
    - Bollinger context: are we near/into the upper or lower band, and what that implies for breakouts or reversals.
    - Volatility regime via ATR: higher ATR indicating higher risk/stop ranges; lower ATR suggesting compression.
  - Practical takeaways for META trading decisions (entries, exits, risk controls) framed around the current market context.
  - A concise Markdown table (as requested) organizing key points for quick reference.

In the meantime, if you’d like me to retry the data fetch now (or retry with a different date window, e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-01-01), I can attempt that immediately. Alternatively, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-agnostic framework for META based on typical patterns seen in tech megacaps, but the full, indicator-driven report will be most precise with the actual data. How would you like to proceed? 

Markdown table: key indicators, interpretation framework, and META-focused notes
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for META | Trading considerations specific to META |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average; mid-term trend direction | Price above 50SMA suggests bullish bias; below indicates bearish bias; crossovers with price/other indicators offer entry/exit cues | Use as a trend filter; avoid overreacting to short-term spikes when price is above/below 50SMA for extended periods |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend context | Price above 200SMA implies long-term uptrend; below implies downtrend; cross with 50SMA (golden/death cross) signals strategic shifts | Important for framing where META might be headed over quarters; align risk-taking with trend direction |
| close_10_ema | 10-period exponential moving average; short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10EMA signals quick momentum shifts; tends to be noisy in choppy markets | Best used with longer-term filters (50/200 SMA) to reduce false signals |
| macd | MACD line, momentum trend changes | MACD line crossing MACD Signal indicates potential trend change; histogram shows momentum strength | Use in combination with RSI and SMA signals to confirm entries/exits |
| macds | MACD Signal line (EMA of MACD) | Crosses with MACD line to generate trade triggers; helps smooth decision points | Helps reduce false positives in high-volatility environments |
| rsi | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | RSI above 70 or below 30 flags overextended moves; look for divergences with price | In strong uptrends, RSI can remain overbought; confirm with trend indicators |
| boll | Bollinger Middle (20SMA) as baseline | Price interacting with middle line indicates trend context; bands provide breakout/reversal cues | Use with band position (upper/lower) to assess breakout potential |
| atr | Average True Range; market volatility | Higher ATR signals larger price moves and wider stops; lower ATR signals compression | Critical for sizing, stop placement, and risk management around META’s earnings cycles and macro events |

If you’d like me to retry now, tell me “Retry data fetch for META.” I’ll kick off another attempt and then deliver the full, detailed indicators report as soon as I have the data.
