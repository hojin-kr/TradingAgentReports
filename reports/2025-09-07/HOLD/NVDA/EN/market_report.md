I’m seeing an internal tool error when attempting to fetch NVDA data from Yahoo Finance (FileNotFoundError). I retried once, but the issue persists. I can retry again, or adjust the request (different date window or data source) if you’d like. In the meantime, I can outline a solid indicator setup and how I’ll analyze NVDA once data retrieval succeeds.

Proposed indicator set (up to 8 indicators) for NVDA
Rationale: NVDA is a high-volatility, high-growth tech name. A mix of trend, momentum, and volatility indicators provides complementary insights without too much redundancy.

- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Captures the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm whether NVDA is in a broader uptrend or downtrend.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for assessing the overarching market regime and potential golden/death cross setups.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum indicator to identify quick shifts and potential entries, especially around pullbacks in an uptrend.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Core momentum signal (MACD line crossovers, divergence) for trend-change considerations.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Smoother signal line; crossovers with MACD to trigger potential entries/exits with trend confirmation.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Momentum strength gauge (histogram); helps spot early momentum shifts and divergence when combined with price action.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Why: Measures momentum exhaustion and potential overbought/oversold conditions; useful for spotting reversals when used with trend context.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Why: Measures current market volatility to inform risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and to contextualize price moves.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A nuanced, trend-focused report that describes:
  - The alignment (or misalignment) between short-term (10-EMA), medium-term (50-SMA), and long-term (200-SMA) trends.
  - Momentum context via MACD, MACD signal, MACD histogram, and RSI readings (including any divergences).
  - Volatility context via ATR to explain move magnitudes and to help with risk controls.
  - Any important confirmations or caveats (e.g., in high-volatility regimes, indicators may give false signals without price-confirmation).

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now with the same window (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-07) or a shorter window if you prefer (e.g., 2024-12-01 to 2025-09-07) to reduce potential data retrieval issues.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with the indicator analysis once data is successfully retrieved and generate a detailed report plus a summary table.

Markdown table: key points to track (to be populated after data retrieval)
| Indicator | Category | What it tells you | How to interpret for NVDA | When to be cautious |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend & dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50-SMA suggests bullish trend; price below suggests bearish | Sharp choppiness can make 50-SMA lag price |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above 200-SMA signals long-term uptrend; below signals downtrend | Crosses by themselves can be slow signals |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum | Price above 10-EMA signals near-term bullishness; below signals weakness | Noise in choppy markets; use with longer-term filters |
| macd | MACD | Momentum crossovers | MACD line crossing above/ below signal line indicates potential entries/exits | Less reliable in low-volatility/sideways markets |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD for confirmation | Crossover with MACD line strengthens signals | Watch for lag in fast moves |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Rising histogram supports a strong move; shrinking/negative histogram signals momentum loss | Can be volatile around earnings or news events |
| rsi | RSI | Overbought/oversold momentum | RSI > 70 overbought, < 30 oversold; look for reversals or divergences | In strong trends RSI can stay overbought/oversold for long periods |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level | Higher ATR indicates larger price moves; informs stop placement | Spikes can be noisy; combine with other signals |

Would you like me to retry fetching NVDA data now with the same window, or would you prefer I adjust the date window (e.g., 2024-12-01 to 2025-09-07) and proceed? If you confirm, I’ll run the data fetch and then produce the full, detailed indicator report with the chosen 8 indicators and the final table.
