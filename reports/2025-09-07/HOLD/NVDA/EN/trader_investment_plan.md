Recommendation: HOLD NVDA

Rationale
- Bull case strengths remain intact: NVDA benefits from secular AI compute demand, a durable CUDA/software moat, and a scalable hardware-plus-software model that supports long-run revenue/FCF growth.
- Bear-case risks justify restraint: valuation is elevated, rate sensitivity remains a hurdle in a higher-for-longer environment, and policy/regulatory tailwinds (notably China/export controls) plus a concentration of revenue among a few large customers add meaningful downside risk if macro conditions deteriorate.
- Current risk-reward: balanced by plausible catalysts and uncertainties. This favors preserving capital and holding rather than aggressive new buying at current levels.

Risk-management actions (if you already own NVDA)
- Trim exposure: consider reducing 15–25% of an existing NVDA position to de-risk concentration and create dry powder for a more favorable entry.
- Protect downside: implement a hedge (e.g., protective puts or a collar) to limit downside while preserving upside optionality.
- Stop discipline: maintain disciplined stop levels (e.g., 15–20% below current price) and reassess if downside channels break decisively.

Entry triggers to consider for re-engagement
- Clear policy clarity: material improvement in China/export-control risk that meaningfully expands addressable markets.
- Macro stabilization: a more favorable rate environment that lowers discount-rate pressure on growth equities.
- Tangible demand catalysts: evidence of sustained data-center demand acceleration outside near-term pullbacks or inventory normalization without margin deterioration.
- Positive quarterly signal: a quarterly print with data-center demand intact and no new regulatory headwinds, potentially allowing a cautious add-on with strict risk controls.

Operational plan
- If you’re neutral or underexposed: wait for a clearly favorable catalyst or a ~10–15% pullback before initiating a position, ensuring risk controls are in place.
- If you’re long: maintain core exposure but use hedges or a partial trim to manage risk and preserve optionality for re-entry.

Lessons integrated
- Focus on secular growth but maintain guardrails against overpaying in high-valuation names.
- Do not rely on a single signal; verify across macro, policy, and company-specific dynamics.
- Preserve optionality with hedges or disciplined risk controls, and revisit thesis quarterly as catalysts evolve.
