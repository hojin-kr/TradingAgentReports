I’m hitting an issue fetching Reddit data for KO on 2025-09-07: FileNotFoundError (the tool is currently failing). I retried twice and it’s still not pulling Reddit results right now. I can’t access the Reddit data at the moment, which limits the live sentiment portion of the report.

Here are your options moving forward:
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and, if it succeeds, produce the full long-form report (sentiment-by-day, social posts themes, a news pulse, and the final Markdown table).
- Option B: I proceed with a high-quality analysis using all available data sources besides Reddit (e.g., official news, earnings chatter, macro news about consumer staples, currency/economic context) and clearly label the sentiment data as “Reddit data unavailable” for the period. I’ll still deliver a structured long report and a Markdown table with key takeaways.
- Option C: Wait for the tool issue to be resolved and then run the full analysis in one pass.

If you’d like, I can start with Option B right away and provide a robust framework plus a filled-out report using non-Reddit signals, then plug in Reddit data as soon as the tool is back up.

What would you prefer? In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the final report (and the kind of insights you’ll get once data is in):

What the final report will cover (once data feeds in)
- Summary: Current state of KO from social sentiment, news flow, and fundamentals in the past week.
- Social sentiment deep-dive: Day-by-day sentiment signals (positive/negative/neutral) and dominant themes from social chatter (KO-related product launches, pricing, packaging, sustainability, dividends, etc.).
- News and catalysts: Key company announcements, macro headlines affecting consumer staples, regulatory/tax considerations, currency impacts, supply chain news.
- Risk/uncertainty: Narrative drivers that could create volatility (earnings expectations, guidance, macro shifts, competing brands, commodity inputs).
- Positioning implications for traders:
  - Short-term catalysts and risks (next 1–2 weeks)
  - Medium-term considerations (next 1–3 months)
  - Sentiment vs. fundamentals alignment or misalignment
- Quantified takeaways: Quantified sentiment deltas, notable vs. mild sentiment changes, and any divergence between social sentiment and price action.
- Practical trading ideas: If assets are mispriced relative to sentiment/news, potential hedges, or confirmation signals to watch.

Proposed Markdown table (to be appended at the end of the report)
- A concise, readable summary of key signals and drivers.
- Columns might include: Date, Data Source, Theme, Sentiment (% Positive), Narrative, Catalyst/News, Potential Impact, Trader Takeaway, Confidence.

Example table skeleton (to be filled with actual data once available):
- Date | Source | Theme | Sentiment | Key Narrative | News/Catalyst | Potential Impact | Trader Takeaway | Confidence

If you’d like Option A (retry now) I’ll attempt the Reddit fetch again and proceed as soon as it succeeds. If you prefer Option B, I’ll start immediately with a comprehensive, non-Reddit-first analysis and clearly mark Reddit data gaps.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
