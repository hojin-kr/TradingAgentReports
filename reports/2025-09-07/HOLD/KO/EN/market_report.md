I attempted to fetch KO data for 2024-09-07 to 2025-09-07 but the data retrieval failed due to a FileNotFoundError on the data source. I’ve tried twice, and the issue appears to be with the data source rather than the request. If you’d like, I can retry with a different date range or later today, but I don’t have a workaround on my end to fix the underlying data source. In the meantime, I can outline the indicators I would run and how I’d interpret them once the data is available.

Selected indicators (up to 8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll_ub
- boll_lb

Why these indicators are suitable
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Provide a clear view of medium- and long-term trend direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance. The 50/200 SMA relationship helps identify potential golden/death cross dynamics and confirm broader trend context that is particularly useful for a large conglomerate like KO with slow-moving price action.
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term visual of momentum shifts, helpful for timing entries when price breaks out of a range or reacts to news-driven moves.
- macd and macds: Together, these capture momentum shifts and potential trend changes via the MACD line and its signal, with crossovers and divergences offering trade signals if used with other filters.
- rsi: Provides momentum strength and overbought/oversold context. Useful for spotting potential reversals or corrections when combined with trend signals from the moving averages.
- boll_ub and boll_lb: Upper and lower Bollinger bands quantify volatility and potential breakout zones. Price touching or riding the upper band in an uptrend can indicate strength, while the lower band can signal support and oversold conditions in a downtrend. Using both bands helps identify squeezes and expansions in volatility.

How I’d interpret these together (framework you’ll see in the full report once data is available)
- Trend validation: Look for price residing above both the 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with the 50 SMA above the 200 SMA, as a bullish backdrop. In this context, a MACD bullish cross (macd crossing above macds) and a rising MACD histogram (macdh > 0) would support an ongoing uptrend. Conversely, price below these averages with MACD bearish signals would reinforce a downtrend.
- Momentum timing: A rising 10 EMA crossing above price or above longer-term averages can signal short-term upside momentum for entries or higher-probability pullbacks in uptrends. RSI confirming strength (rsi moving toward 60–70 but not overbought) would back such moves.
- Volatility and breakouts: Boll upper and lower bands help you gauge breakout potential and volatility regimes. In a trending market, prices may ride the bands; in range-bound periods, a squeeze (bands converging) followed by a breakout can be a timing clue.
- Reversals and risk management: RSI divergence (noted when price makes new highs but RSI fails to) can warn of potential reversals, especially after a period of heat in the trend. ATR considerations (if added later) would help size stops appropriately around these scenarios.

Actionable takeaways you can use once data is back
- Bullish setup (example pattern when data is available):
  - Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with 50 SMA > 200 SMA
  - MACD line crosses above MACD signal; MACD histogram turns positive
  - RSI rising but not in overbought territory
  - Price hugging or breaking toward the upper Bollinger band
  - ATR indicates rising volatility but within a manageable range

- Bearish setup:
  - Price below both SMAs or 50 SMA below 200 SMA
  - MACD crosses below its signal; MACD histogram turns negative
  - RSI rolling toward 30–40 or under 50 with momentum weakening
  - Price testing lower Bollinger band with potential rejection
  - ATR supporting a widening volatility environment (for risk-managed entries)

- Neutral/consolidation:
  - Price moves between the bands with RSI around mid-levels and MACD histogram near zero
  - Watch for a squeeze (bands converging) followed by a breakout in either direction

What I’ll deliver once the data fetch succeeds
- A detailed, nuanced trend report for KO, covering:
  - Trend direction and strength from 50SMA/200SMA
  - Short-term momentum from 10EMA and MACD family (macd and macds)
  - Momentum and overbought/oversold context from RSI
  - Volatility and breakout signals from Bollinger bands (boll_ub and boll_lb)
  - Key risk controls and potential entry/exit signals with example levels (where applicable)

Would you like me to retry fetching KO data with a different date range (e.g., starting in 2023 or 2024) or wait until the data source is accessible again? If you have a preference for a specific date window, I can try that first. Once the data is accessible, I’ll run the indicators and provide the full, detailed report with the requested Markdown table summarizing the key points.
