Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch the latest TSLA Reddit stock news for 2025-09-07 using the provided tool, but it returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the Reddit data source is currently unavailable in this environment, so I can’t pull the week’s Reddit sentiment data directly right now.

What I can do next
- Retry the Reddit data fetch if/when the tool becomes available again.
- Proceed with a robust alternative approach using other sources (e.g., major news outlets, official Tesla announcements, other social platforms) to assemble a comprehensive sentiment and news picture for the past week.
- Or, if you prefer, I can draft the full long-form report structure now and fill in the data as soon as Reddit data is accessible, ensuring you get a complete, trader-focused analysis with a final Markdown table.

Proposed plan for TSLA sentiment/news analysis (past week)
- Data sources (priority order if Reddit is unavailable)
  - Public news headlines and articles (Reuters, Bloomberg, CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ, etc.)
  - Other social channels (X/Twitter, StockTwits) for directional sentiment and key talking points
  - Tesla and Elon Musk-words in official statements, events, or earnings notes
- Sentiment analysis approach
  - Daily sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative) and volume (post counts)
  - Top recurring topics driving sentiment (e.g., price, deliveries, FSD, 4680 battery updates, production guidance)
  - Event-driven spikes (earnings rumors, product announcements, regulatory/news events)
- Narrative and themes to expect (structure, not conclusions)
  - Short-term catalysts: any product launches, price changes, or delivery milestones
  - Long-tail risks: supply chain, regulatory scrutiny, competition in EV/AI segments
  - Macro/sector context: broader market sentiment affecting semi/construction/tech peers
- Market context to tie to sentiment
  - TSLA price action and intraday/weekly volume
  - Volatility context (implied volatility and recent option activity if available)
  - Correlation between sentiment shifts and price moves
- Output format
  - A thorough narrative report with sections on: overview, daily sentiment breakdown, notable headlines, price-action context, risk considerations, and trading implications
  - A final Markdown table summarizing key points for quick reference

What I’ll deliver if Reddit data becomes available
- A week-long day-by-day sentiment breakdown (date, average sentiment, post volume, top topics)
- The most influential Reddit threads or themes driving sentiment
- Cross-referenced headlines from other sources with brief sentiment notes
- Trader-focused takeaways and potential scenarios (bullish/bearish/neutral) with suggested watch levels
- A concluding section on implications for TSLA trading/positioning

If you’d like me to proceed now without Reddit data, I can produce the full qualitative report based on available alternative sources and clearly mark where Reddit data would have informed the conclusions. Please confirm which path you prefer:
- Retry Reddit data fetch later and then generate the full Reddit-backed report
- Proceed with a comprehensive TSLA sentiment/news analysis using non-Reddit sources (and I’ll note any data gaps)
- Or provide any preferred sources you want me to include

In the meantime, here’s a ready-to-fill template for the Markdown table I’ll append at the end of the final report. I’ll replace the blanks with actual data once I have the sources.

- Template (to be filled after data collection)
- Date | Daily Social Sentiment (avg) | Post Volume | Top Topics/Topics Driving Sentiment | Major News Headlines | TSLA Price Change (intraday/week) | Key Driver(s) | Trading Implications

Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll adapt quickly.
