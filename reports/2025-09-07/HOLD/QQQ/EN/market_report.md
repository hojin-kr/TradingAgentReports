Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch QQQ data to compute the indicators, but I’m currently hitting a data-access error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

Because the data feed isn’t accessible right now, I can’t generate the live indicator values or a trend report. I can, however, prepare a robust plan and a detailed framework so you’re ready to proceed as soon as the data fetch succeeds. I’ve also selected a complementary set of indicators (up to 8) that will give you a well-rounded view of trend, momentum, volatility, and volume for QQQ.

Selected indicators (up to 8), with rationale
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it adds: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the prevailing regime when combined with longer-term averages.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it adds: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming broader market context (golden/death cross perspectives) and filtering noisy entries.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it adds: Responsive short-term momentum. Helps catch quicker shifts in price action when used with the 50/200 SMAs.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it adds: Core momentum signal via the difference between fast/slow EMAs. Useful for trend-change cues, especially when aligned with other filters.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it adds: MACD histogram, showing momentum strength and early divergence clues. Complements macd crossovers with a sense of momentum intensity.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - What it adds: Momentum balance gauge with overbought/oversold context. Divergence and level readings help anticipate potential reversals, especially when trend is strong.
- boll
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it adds: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a baseline for price dispersion. Useful to identify mean-reversion vs. breakout tendencies when paired with bands.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it adds: True range-based volatility measure. Guides risk management (stop placement, position sizing) in line with current market volatility.

What I will deliver once data access resumes
- A detailed, nuanced trend report for QQQ that covers:
  - The relative positioning of price vs. 50SMA and 200SMA (trend direction, potential regime shifts, cross-over signals).
  - The interaction of price with the 10EMA for short-term momentum and potential pullback/continuation points.
  - MACD, MACD histogram, and their alignment with price action to identify strength and potential warnings of fading momentum.
  - RSI context (level readings and possible divergences) in the frame of the prevailing trend (as indicated by SMAs and MACD).
  - Bollinger Middle context and how price interacts with the bands to signal breakouts vs. mean-reversions.
  - ATR-driven volatility context to inform risk management and potential stop placement.
- A concise narrative describing:
  - Whether the indicators collectively point toward a bullish, bearish, or range-bound regime.
  - Subtleties such as bullish momentum despite slight price pullbacks, or rising volatility with stalled momentum.
  - Potential signal confirmations and caveats to avoid false positives.
- A practical table summarizing each indicator’s role, how to interpret its signals, and suggested action framework (buy/hold/sell guidance will be provided only after data is available and signals align with your risk tolerance).

Next steps (how you can proceed now)
- I can retry fetching the QQQ data immediately. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry with the same date window (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-07) or
  - Use a different window (e.g., last 180–365 days) to maximize data availability, or
  - Narrow the timeline to a more recent period (e.g., last 60–120 days) for timely signals.
- Alternatively, you can suggest a fallback data source or confirm you want me to proceed with the available data window once the fetch succeeds.

Would you like me to retry fetching QQQ data now with the same window, or would you prefer a different date range to maximize the chances of a successful data load?

Appendix: Quick reference table (indicators and what they measure)
| Indicator | Category | What it measures / adds to your view | How signals help trading decisions |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Confirm regime; use with 200SMA for cross-based signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark; overall market regime | Validate secular trend; flags golden/death-cross contexts |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; quick shifts in price | Spot immediate momentum changes; filter with longer MA |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMA differences; trend-change cues | Crosses/breaks signal potential entries or exits; use with filters |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength via histogram | Divergence and strength cues; corroborates macd signals |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum balance; overbought/oversold context | Extreme readings hint reversals; watch for divergences |
| boll | Volatility Indicators | Bollinger Middle (20SMA) baseline | Mean-reversion vs. breakout tendencies around middle band |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Average true range; current volatility level | Guides risk management and stop placement; adjust position size |

Status: Data fetch currently unavailable. I’m ready to retry as soon as you authorize or suggest a new window.
