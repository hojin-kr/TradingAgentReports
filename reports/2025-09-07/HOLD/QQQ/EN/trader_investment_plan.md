Recommendation: Hold QQQ with hedges and disciplined risk controls. Do not aggressively add to mega-cap tech exposure until clearer macro signals and data confirmations emerge. Maintain optionality to scale in if conditions improve, but preserve capital with protective measures.

Rationale
- Near-term risks remain credible: macro regime uncertainty, potential valuation compression, and concentration risk in a few megacaps.
- Data access fragility and regulatory/geopolitical headwinds add downside sensitivity; hedging helps limit downside while keeping upside optionality.
- Long-term fundamentals for AI-enabled growth remain compelling, but the current environment doesn’t justify a large beta tilt without protections.

Concrete actions to implement
- Hedging: establish protective downside protection on QQQ (e.g., long-dated puts 6–12 months out at 5–10% OTM) or implement a collar to fund puts while capping upside. Consider a bear put spread on top-weighted holdings if name-specific risk is preferred.
- Position management: if currently overweight, reduce net exposure to QQQ by roughly 5–15% of total portfolio allocation over the next 4–8 weeks.
- Diversification: allocate a portion of capital to high-quality, less cyclically exposed sectors or broad-market quality exposure to reduce single-signal risk within a megacap-heavy theme.
- Cash and risk discipline: maintain a modest cash reserve to fund hedges and opportunistic entries; implement a quarterly or event-driven rebalancing cadence with clear triggers.
- Data hygiene: use fallback qualitative signals when data feeds lag; maintain a simple risk dashboard (price action vs. moving averages, momentum, volatility spikes) for rapid reviews.
- Documentation and governance: keep a concise decision log of hedging actions, triggers, and rationale; review after major data releases or earnings events.

Triggers and review
- Bear case triggers to act more aggressively: material macro deterioration, regulatory pressure intensifies, or top-weight earnings/margin issues emerge.
- Bull case triggers to lighten hedges: sustained AI demand acceleration, improving macro signals, and corroborated earnings visibility; consider modestly reducing hedges or adding diversified exposure if risk controls remain intact.

Bottom line
- Hold with risk-managed hedges and a disciplined plan to rebalance only when evidence clearly supports a more favorable risk-reward setup. The strategy preserves downside protection while staying ready to participate in upside if conditions improve.
