Sorry—the Reddit data fetch for QQQ on 2025-09-07 errored (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data pull now, or I can proceed with a high-level analysis using other signals while we wait for Reddit data to come through. Which would you prefer?

In the meantime, here’s a provisional plan and a qualitative framework I would build into the full report once we have Reddit sentiment data:

What I will cover once we have Reddit data
- Daily sentiment trajectory for QQQ over the past week, with short-term sentiment shifts tied to macro news, tech earnings, and ETF flows.
- Thematic drivers from social chatter (e.g., mega-cap tech names, AI hype, valuation concerns, macro rate expectations, liquidity and options activity).
- Corroborating signals from recent headlines and public sentiment (news outlets, crypto/regulatory talk, etc.).
- Implications for traders:
  - Potential continuation or reversal signals based on sentiment shifts.
  - How concentration in the Nasdaq-100/QQQ holdings (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, etc.) can magnify moves.
  - Key risk factors (rising rates, tech valuations, sector rotation, macro surprises).
- A concise set of actionable takeaways and a watchlist for the next 1–2 weeks.

If you want me to proceed with a partial report now (excluding Reddit specifics) I can deliver a structured qualitative analysis with hypothetical sentiment framing and clearly labeled placeholders to be filled in once the data arrives.

Ready to:
- Retry fetching Reddit data now, or
- Move forward with the general framework and fill in Reddit details later?

Proposed Markdown table structure (to be populated in the final report)
- I’ll append this at the end once we have data:
| Key Theme | Sentiment Indicator | Data Source | Trader Implications | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tech mega-cap exposure | Bullish/Bearish/Neutral | Reddit (to fill) | Potential continuation/rotation signals | High/Medium/Low |
| Macro/rate backdrop | Positive/Negative/Neutral | News feeds, macro data | Impacts on tech-heavy ETFs like QQQ | High |
| ETF flow & liquidity | Inflow/Outflow indicators | Market data | Timing for entries/exits around price levels | Medium |
| Valuation vs. growth expectations | Concerns/Optimism | Sentiment + earnings commentary | Positioning risk/reward | Medium |

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the general qualitative analysis first?
