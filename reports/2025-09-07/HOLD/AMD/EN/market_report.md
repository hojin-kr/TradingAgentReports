I attempted to fetch AMD data and run the indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source or local cache/backend needed for these calls isn’t available right now. I can retry when the data source is back, or you can provide the CSV/timeframe you want analyzed. In the meantime, I’ll lay out a solid, complementary indicator suite tailored for AMD (ticker: AMD) and how I’d interpret them once data is available. This will help you act quickly as soon as the data pulls succeed.

Selected indicators (up to 8) with rationale for AMD
1) close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it measures: Intermediate-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why for AMD: AMD tends to trend with broader market cycles and semiconductor demand cycles. The 50 SMA helps identify the ongoing trend direction and acts as a nearby support/resistance level during pullbacks.

2) close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark; major level for trend confirmation.
- Why for AMD: Use as a strategic filter to confirm whether the stock is in an overall uptrend or downtrend. A golden cross/death cross with the 50 SMA can give meaningful longer-term context.

3) close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it measures: Quick-shift momentum and short-term trend.
- Why for AMD: Captures rapid shifts in price dynamics around AI-cycle news, product launches, or demand changes. Helpful for tighter entries when combined with the longer-term SMAs.

4) macd (MACD line)
- Category: MACD Related
- What it measures: Momentum through differences of EMAs; trend-change signals.
- Why for AMD: MACD crossovers can indicate acceleration/deceleration in price momentum, useful in volatile semis environments where momentum swings can precede price moves.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- Category: MACD Related
- What it measures: EMA-smoothed MACD; signal line for crossovers.
- Why for AMD: Crossovers of MACD vs MACDS provide a confirmatory signal, helping reduce false entries in choppy markets.

6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
- Category: MACD Related
- What it measures: Momentum strength and divergence via the gap between MACD and its signal.
- Why for AMD: Histogram spikes/drops and divergences can warn of trend strength changes ahead of price breaks, useful for pre-breakout or pre-reversion timing.

7) rsi (RSI)
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- What it measures: Relative momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
- Why for AMD: In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; use with trend filters (50/200 SMA) to avoid premature exits. RSI also helps spot reversals, especially when there are negative catalysts.

8) atr (Average True Range)
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it measures: Market volatility and range size.
- Why for AMD: Helps set risk controls and position sizing. In AMD’s volatile environment, ATR-based stop placement and trailing stops can keep risk in check during earnings-driven moves or beta-driven swings.

What I would look for once data is available
- Trend confirmation: Ensure AMD price is above the 50 SMA and ideally above the 200 SMA for bullish bias; watch for crossovers where 10 EMA crosses above/below the 50 SMA as a momentum signal.
- Momentum shifts: Monitor MACD line vs MACDS for bullish/bearish crossovers; use MACDH for detecting acceleration or weakening momentum (divergence against price can be especially telling around earnings or AI-cycle news).
- Entry/exit signals: A scenario like price above 50 SMA + MACD bullish crossover + RSI above 50 but not in extreme overbought (>70) could be a constructive entry setup; conversely, price below 50/200 SMA with MACD bearish cross and RSI diverging downward would be a cautious stance.
- Volatility and risk management: Use ATR to set wider/smaller stops corresponding to current volatility; higher ATR suggests wider stops and potentially larger position sizing adjustments.

How to use these together (high-level trading approach)
- Use trend filters: Only take long entries when price is above 50 SMA and ideally above 200 SMA; for shorts, prefer price below the moving averages.
- Confirm momentum: Require MACD line above MACDS and a rising MACDH when entering long positions; look for RSI confirming momentum without extreme overbought levels.
- Manage risk with ATR: Set initial stop loss at a multiple of ATR from entry, adjust as ATR changes; use ATR to size positions to maintain consistent risk per trade.
- Watch for divergences: If price makes higher highs but MACD/MACDH fails to confirm, or RSI shows bullish/bearish divergence, treat as caution signals.

Next steps
- I will re-run data retrieval and generate the full report with current values, crossovers, RSI zones, MACD histograms, and ATR-based risk parameters as soon as the data source becomes available again.
- If you prefer, I can attempt a smaller window (e.g., last 90-180 days) first or switch to a local CSV you provide to expedite the analysis.

Markdown table: key indicators, purpose, and trading use for AMD
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for AMD |
|-----------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Intermediate-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Trend direction; use with price above for bullish bias; pullbacks to 50 SMA as potential buying spots when accompanied by positive momentum signals. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirm overall trend; golden cross with 50 SMA is bullish; death cross is bearish. Use as strategic filter. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Capture quick shifts; identify near-term entry points when aligned with longer-term trend. Prone to noise; filter with other indicators. |
| macd | MACD Line | Momentum and trend changes | Look for cross above/below MACDS for buy/sell cues; stronger when MACDH supports the move. |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD for cross signals | Crossovers with MACD line confirm signals; reduces false positives in volatile periods. |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength/divergence | Divergence from price can precede trend changes; use with price action and RSI for early warning. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold momentum | RSI >70 overbought, <30 oversold; in strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated—use with trend context to avoid premature exits. |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility and true range | Size positions and set stops; higher ATR means wider stops; adjust risk management as volatility changes around earnings/AI-cycle news. |

Please let me know if you’d like me to retry data retrieval now, or if you can provide the data file or a narrower date range. I’ll then generate the full, data-driven trend report for AMD with precise current readings and actionable signals.
