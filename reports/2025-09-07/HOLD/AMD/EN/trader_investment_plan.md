Decision: Hold

Rationale
- Near-term ambiguity remains despite a durable multi-year AI/data-center thesis. The plan correctly notes mixed signals on order cadence, licensing/regulatory risk, and near-term margin trajectory, which keep a Buy at current levels as too uncertain.
- The bear cases (regulatory/licensing headwinds, Nvidia’s dominance in GPUs, potential hit from onshoring costs) are material enough to prevent a confident upgrade, even as the longer-term TAM expansion remains compelling.
- A Hold aligns with a data-driven approach: await clearer evidence of durable data-center orders, margin improvement, and milestone delivery (Zen 6/RDNA5) before committing larger capital.

What would push to Buy
- Confirmed, broader hyperscaler order diversity with durable extensions beyond a few marquee programs.
- Tangible margin uplift from mix-shift to high-value data-center products (EPYC/MI) and clearer progress on Zen 6/RDNA5 milestones.
- Licensing clarity and a stable regulatory backdrop that translates into multi-quarter visibility.
- Clear, executable US fabrics ramp with favorable cost timing that supports near-term margin expansion.

What would push to Sell
- Material miss on hyperscaler orders, sustained licensing/regulatory headwinds, or delays in Zen 6/RDNA5 that impair near-term revenue and gross margins.
- Evidence of deteriorating supply-chain costs or onshoring expenses that erode profitability more than expected.
- A pronounced shift in AI compute demand away from AMD’s offerings or a meaningful share loss to Nvidia in key data-center segments.

Strategic actions and watch plan
- Position sizing: avoid overweight exposure in Hold; use a defined risk budget and consider hedges to shield against tech-wide volatility.
- Data-driven triggers (predefined thresholds to reassess): monitor order cadence signals, licensing updates, milestone progress, and US manufacturing ramp timing. Prefer staged actions rather than all-at-once moves.
- Scenario planning: maintain three scenarios (base, bull, bear) with predefined position adjustments (trim, hedge, or add) as data evolves.
- Monitoring cadence: weekly reviews when data is flowing; bi-weekly otherwise. Rebalance only when multiple signals align and risk-adjusted upside is clear.

Learning from past decisions
- Maintain discipline to rely on multiple data points rather than a single narrative. Use explicit risk controls and documented triggers to avoid crowd-driven moves.
- Preserve a transparent log of signals that would change the stance, ensuring accountability if the stance shifts.

Bottom line
- Based on the provided analysis, the prudent stance remains Hold. The upside requires clearer, multi-quarter validation of orders, margins, and milestone progress, while risks remain non-trivial in the near term.
