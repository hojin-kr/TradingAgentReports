I attempted to fetch the latest AMD fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) for 2025-09-07, but I’m encountering a system/file error (FileNotFoundError) from the data tools. Because of the outage, I don’t have the numeric data to include yet.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can try to run the data tools again in hopes the issue is transient.
- Partial data approach: I can fetch whatever tools come back online (e.g., insider sentiment or insider transactions separately) and build a partial report.
- Qualitative plan: I can provide a thorough, trader-focused fundamental framework for AMD using publicly known context up to today, plus a detailed template of the exact sections and the type of insights you’ll get once the data loads.

What I propose I deliver once data loads (structure you’ll get in the final report):
- Company profile and business model
  - AMD’s core segments (CPUs, GPUs, datacenter accelerators, embedded/other) and end markets (PC, data center, gaming, AI/compute).
  - Competitive positioning vs peers (e.g., Intel, Nvidia) and macro exposure (PC cycles, data center demand, AI compute cycle).
- Basic financials (latest quarterly and year-to-date)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, free cash flow, capex intensity.
  - Revenue mix by segment/geography if available; notable YoY/QoQ trends.
- Balance sheet snapshot
  - Total assets/liabilities/equity, cash and equivalents, debt levels, liquidity ratios.
  - Key off-balance-sheet items or lease obligations if disclosed.
- Cash flow analysis
  - Operating cash flow trend, working capital dynamics, capital expenditures, FCF, financing activities.
- Income statement deep dive
  - Gross/margin drivers, R&D intensity, SG&A efficiency, any non-recurring items.
- Insider sentiment (past 30 days)
  - Net sentiment signal, notable voices, potential bias or catalysts (e.g., governance changes, major product launches).
- Insider transactions (past 30 days)
  - Large buys/sells, insider roles, potential implications for confidence or risk.
- Grading/trend assessment for traders
  - Financial health (liquidity, leverage), earnings quality, margin trajectory, cash generation vs. capex needs.
  - Growth runway (AI/datacenter demand, product cycles) and risk factors (supplier, competition, cyclical PC demand).
- Risks and catalysts
  - Near-term catalysts (product launches, AI adoption), longer-term secular risks, regulatory notes.
- Quick-scan conclusions and action considerations
  - How the fundamentals align with potential trading theses (BUY/HOLD/SELL) based on liquidity, growth, and risk.

Appendix: Markdown table to summarize key points (to be filled with actual figures once data loads).

If you’d like, I can proceed with one of these:
- Option A: Retry all tools now and then deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as they return a result.
- Option B: Provide a qualitative, data-light analysis today (no numeric figures) and then update with the exact numbers when the data tools come back.
- Option C: Proceed with a best-effort qualitative AMD fundamental framework right away, without the latest quarter figures, and clearly label what data will be updated once the tools respond.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly. If you want me to retry now, I’ll kick off another round of tool calls immediately.
