Sorry — I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for INTC on 2025-09-07, but the tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError) and I can’t retrieve the data right now. I’ve retried a few times with no success. I can either:

- Try again in a few minutes, or
- Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using available context (without the exact Reddit sentiment feed) and clearly label it as such, then update when the tool is usable again.

How would you like to proceed?

In the meantime, here is how I will proceed once the Reddit/news feed is accessible, plus a plan you can review to save time:

What I will deliver (when data is available)
- Daily sentiment snapshot: bullish, bearish, neutral counts; top themes driving sentiment each day; notable influencers or threads.
- Recent news synthesis (last 7 days): headlines, brief summaries, and implications for fundamentals and sentiment.
- Thematic analysis: AI & semiconductor demand trends, Intel’s foundry/IO capabilities, supply chain, product launches, guidance vs. consensus, leadership commentary.
- Price-action alignment: correlation between sentiment/news signals and intraday/weekly price moves; volatilization risk notes.
- Risk and catalyst map: near-term catalysts (earnings cadence, product roadmaps, foundry announcements, regulatory/policy shifts) and downside risk factors.
- Trader-oriented takeaways: possible entry/exit scenarios, preferred horizon (intraday, swing, position), risk controls (stop levels, scenario planning).

Proposed structure and a starting table (to be filled with actual data once the tool is up)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment trend, key drivers, and headline risk.
- Social sentiment deep-dive: by day, themes, and notable posts.
- News heatmap: top 5 headlines with quick implications.
- Sentiment vs price: short analysis of how sentiment aligned with price moves.
- Risk/Opportunity: bullets summarizing catalysts and red flags.
- Trade ideas: practical ideas with caveats.
- Appendix: data sources and methodology.

Markdown table template (to be filled after data is retrieved)
- Date | Daily Sentiment | Top Themes | Notable Posts/Influencers | News Headline | Price Action Context | Implication for Traders | Quick Take

If you’d like, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-contextual analysis now (without the Reddit-specific sentiment scores) and clearly flag that it’s based on general market context and Intel’s recent public disclosures. Then I’ll update with the Reddit-specific sentiment data as soon as the tool is available again. Which approach would you prefer?
