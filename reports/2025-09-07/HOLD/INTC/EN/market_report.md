Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch data and run the indicator analyses, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError for all requested indicators. I’ll summarize the plan and provide a robust, complementary set of indicators you can use once data is available, plus how to interpret them for INTC today.

What happened
- The data fetch (get_YFin_data) and the indicator reports (get_stockstats_indicators_report) currently failed due to a backend file-not-found error.
- Because of this, I don’t have live numeric readings to quote. I’ve prepared a tightly curated, non-redundant set of indicators (up to 8) that will give you a well-rounded view once data is retrievable. If you’d like, I can retry as soon as the data service is back up.

Recommended indicators (8 total) and why they’re complementary
1) close_50_sma
- What it covers: Medium-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance.
- How to use: Price above 50SMA suggests a bullish medium-term bias; a cross of price below it can signal a pullback or trend weakening. Use as a trend filter for entries from faster signals.
- Why it helps INTC: Intel often trades in cycles tied to product cycles and demand; 50SMA helps smooth out shorter swings and align trades with the broader medium-term trend.

2) close_200_sma
- What it covers: Long-term trend benchmark and major visual cue for regime shifts (golden cross/death cross).
- How to use: Price above 200SMA supports a long-term uptrend; price below may indicate a longer-term bear bias. Use for macro-direction framing and risk posture.
- Why it helps INTC: Long-duration trends in semis matter; 200SMA helps avoid whipsaws when short-term noise is high.

3) close_10_ema
- What it covers: Responsive short-term momentum.
- How to use: When price crosses above/below the 10-EMA, looks for quicker momentum shifts; good for timing with other signals (e.g., waiting for a MACD confirmation).
- Why it helps INTC: In volatile semis environments, a fast-acting measure like 10-EMA can pinpoint swift momentum changes.

4) macd
- What it covers: Core momentum via differences of EMAs (trend strength and direction).
- How to use: Watch for MACD line crossovers, MACD above/below zero, and convergence/divergence with price for potential trend changes.
- Why it helps INTC: MACD captures momentum shifts that may accompany product announcements, demand cycles, or capacity news.

5) macds
- What it covers: MACD Signal (EMA of MACD line) smoothing crossovers.
- How to use: Use MACD vs MACDS crossovers as a clearer trigger than MACD alone to reduce false signals.
- Why it helps INTC: Complementary to MACD for more robust entry/exit timing.

6) macdh
- What it covers: MACD Histogram (momentum strength visualization).
- How to use: Rising histogram indicates strengthening momentum; shrinking or negative histogram implies fading momentum. Divergence with price can warn of reversals.
- Why it helps INTC: Helps gauge the durability of a move, which is useful when entering around earnings or guidance updates.

7) rsi
- What it covers: Momentum with overbought/oversold context.
- How to use: Typical thresholds of 70/30 for potential reversals; watch for bullish/bearish divergence against price and trend context from MA/SMA.
- Why it helps INTC: RSI adds a relative momentum view to confirm or warn against trend-based signals, especially in extended runs or pullbacks.

8) atr
- What it covers: Volatility (true range) for position sizing and stop placement.
- How to use: Use ATR-based stop losses (e.g., a multiple of ATR) to adapt to current volatility; widen stops in high-volatility periods and tighten in calm periods.
- Why it helps INTC: Semiconductor stocks can exhibit episodic volatility around earnings or product cycle news; ATR helps manage risk appropriately.

What to monitor and how to interpret (practical guide)
- Trend framing:
  - If price remains above 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA, favor bullish exposure (with risk controls).
  - If price sits below both moving averages or they are converging, adopt a more cautious stance or wait for a clearer signal.
- Momentum triggers:
  - MACD and MACDS crossovers with price direction give entries/exits, but confirm with RSI (e.g., RSI not in extreme overbought conditions) to reduce false positives.
  - A rising MACD Histogram (MACDH) alongside price moving higher strengthens the conviction.
- Volatility/risk management:
  - ATR-based stops help adapt to current market noise; use a multi-ATR distance to avoid premature stop-outs in volatile periods.
- Short-term timing:
  - Use the 10-EMA cross with MACD/MACDS as a timing layer to catch quick moves after a trend is established by longer-term indicators.

Notes on INTC context (without live data)
- Intel’s stock can experience sensitivities around demand curves in PCs/servers, capacity expansions, roadmaps, and AI hardware headlines. A multi-indicator approach helps you:
  - Filter for longer-term trend alignment (50SMA/200SMA).
  - Identify shorter-term momentum shifts for entries/exits (10-EMA, MACD family).
  - Add divergence/overbought-oversold context (RSI) to avoid buying into extended rallies or selling into oversold dips that aren’t confirmed by trend.
  - Manage risk with volatility-aware stops (ATR).

Proposed next steps
- If you want, I can retry data retrieval now and provide a concrete numeric snapshot with the eight indicators above, plus a detailed, point-by-point interpretation for INTC as of the latest date the data is available.
- Alternatively, provide a preferred date range or ask me to proceed with a qualitative narrative based on typical sector dynamics, and I’ll tailor the interpretation to current market conditions.

Markdown table: key indicators, what they tell you, and how to act
- Note: Values will be filled once data is retrieved.

| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret (typical signals) | Practical trading cues for INTC |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA = bullish bias; price below = bearish bias | Use as a trend filter for entries; avoid aggressive long bets when price is below 50SMA |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA = long-term uptrend; price below = long-term downtrend | Consider strategic long exposure when above 200SMA; otherwise tilt toward prudence or hedges |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10-EMA signals quick momentum shifts | Use for timing with MACD confirmations; be wary in choppy markets |
| macd | Momentum direction and strength | MACD line crossover, positive/negative regime | Look for MACD cross with price alignment; confirm with MACDS for clearer signals |
| macds | MACD Signal smoothing | MACD vs MACDS cross as a trigger | Use as a more robust trigger than MACD alone |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Rising MACDH = strengthening move; falling = fading momentum | Watch for momentum divergence with price for reversal cues |
| rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold context | >70 overbought, <30 oversold; potential divergence | Use to confirm/contradict trend signals; be cautious of extreme readings in strong trends |
| atr | Market volatility; risk management | Higher ATR = higher volatility; lower ATR = calmer markets | Set stops and position sizes based on ATR to avoid outsized risk in volatile periods |

If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now and deliver a full, concrete report with current values for INTC using these eight indicators. Just say the word and I’ll attempt again.
