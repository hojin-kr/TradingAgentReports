I ran into a tool access issue. All attempted data fetches (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement for ORCL) returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like an environment error rather than a data issue. I can retry in a moment, or proceed with a qualitative fundamentals overview and a plan for when the data tools come back online. Please tell me which you prefer. In the meantime, here’s a thorough Oracle (ORCL) fundamentals framework and context you can start using right away.

What I can provide right now (framework and context)
- Company profile
  - Oracle Corporation (ORCL) is a leading provider of enterprise software and cloud services. Its core strengths include database technology, middleware, and a growing cloud platform (OCI) and applications stack. Oracle has historically combined licensing revenue with ongoing support/maintenance and services, and has been transitioning to a cloud-centric model with subscription-based revenue.
  - Key business segments (typical structure): Cloud Services, On-Prem Software, Hardware and Middleware, Services. The mix has been gradually shifting toward cloud/subscription and OCI, with strategic acquisitions to bolster cloud capabilities.

- Why this matters for traders
  - Growth levers: Cloud growth (OCI), autonomous database and data management, and enterprise applications. Market share shifts between Oracle, AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud can influence top-line growth and margins.
  - Profitability trajectory: Oracle has tended to generate strong operating cash flow, which supports buybacks and dividends, but margins can be pressured by mix shift and ongoing capex in cloud infra. Tracking operating margin, free cash flow, and cash conversion is important.
  - Balance sheet and liquidity: Historically, Oracle has carried meaningful debt but also strong cash generation. Net leverage and cash position matter for affordability of buybacks, acquisitions, and buyback programs.

- What the upcoming data will tell us (and what to look for)
  - Insider sentiment (past 30 days): Gauges whether insiders are bullish or bearish on the stock; directionally supportive signals if insiders are accumulating on weakness, or risk signals if insider selling spikes.
  - Insider transactions (past 30 days): Extreme levels of insider buying can suggest confidence in the company’s near-term prospects; heavy selling could indicate concerns or liquidity needs.
  - Balance sheet (latest quarterly): 
    - Cash and equivalents, total debt, net debt, and liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio).
    - Shareholder equity and leverage metrics (total debt to EBITDA, interest coverage).
  - Income statement (latest quarterly): 
    - Revenue growth rate, gross margin, operating margin, EBITDA, net income.
    - Segmented revenue trends (cloud vs. license/support) and any commentary on mix shifts.
  - Cash flow statement (latest quarterly): 
    - Operating cash flow, free cash flow, capital expenditures, and financing activities.
  - Trend context: Compare the latest quarter against the prior-year quarter and the sequential quarter to identify seasonality and trajectory.

Proposed next steps (when data tools are available)
- Retrieve:
  1) get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment for ORCL with curr_date = 2025-09-07
  2) get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions for ORCL with curr_date = 2025-09-07
  3) get_simfin_balance_sheet for ORCL, freq = quarterly, curr_date = 2025-09-07
  4) get_simfin_income_stmt for ORCL, freq = quarterly, curr_date = 2025-09-07
  5) get_simfin_cashflow for ORCL, freq = quarterly, curr_date = 2025-09-07
- Synthesize data into a full fundamentals report with:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Recent financial snapshot (revenue, margins, cash flow)
  - Balance sheet health and liquidity
  - Cash flow quality and capex intensity
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions assessment
  - Historical trend analysis (past 6-8 quarters)
  - Risks (execution of cloud strategy, competitive intensity, customer concentration, macro headwinds)
  - Trader-oriented takeaways (key catalysts, what drives upside vs. downside, and a data-backed view on risk/reward)

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now. Otherwise, I can proceed with a detailed qualitative ORCL fundamentals report based on the latest publicly known context and clearly label any data gaps until the tool data returns.
