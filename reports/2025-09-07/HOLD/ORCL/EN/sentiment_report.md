Thanks for the prompt. I hit a hiccup pulling Reddit data for ORCL on 2025-09-07—the Reddit data fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t retrieve the latest Reddit sentiment for today until that backend issue is resolved.

What I can do right now
- Retry now or with an adjacent date range (e.g., 2025-08-31 to 2025-09-07) to still capture the week’s sentiment.
- If you’re okay with it, switch focus to other available sources (news headlines, official Oracle announcements, earnings notes) once the Reddit tool is back, to keep the overall analysis timely.

What I’ll deliver when data becomes available
- A comprehensive, trader-focused report on ORCL describing:
  - Daily sentiment trajectory across the past week from Reddit, highlighting spikes, reversals, and notable posts.
  - Top themes driving sentiment (e.g., Oracle Cloud growth, AI initiatives, licensing/ pricing, partnerships, competitors, regulatory/lightweight coverage).
  - Key news events this week and their potential sentiment impact.
  - Quantified sentiment signals (bullish vs bearish) and their persistence (1-3 days, 4-7 days, etc.).
  - Identified risks and catalysts for the near term (earnings timing, product launches, macro factors).
  - Implications and trading ideas for traders (entry/exit/stop ideas, risk management, time horizons).
  - A concise, easy-to-scan Markdown summary table at the end with key points.

Request to proceed
- Would you like me to retry pulling Reddit data now (same date), or would you prefer I pull an adjacent date range (e.g., 2025-08-31 through 2025-09-07) to still capture this week’s sentiment?
- If you’re okay with it, I can also begin compiling the outline and planned analysis immediately so the final report is ready as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Next steps once you respond
- I’ll run the data fetch again (the chosen date window), then produce the full long-form report with a final Markdown table of key points.
