Recommendation: Hold.

Rationale
- The provided investment plan for ORCL strongly supports a longer-term bull case (OCI AI/infrastructure, Fusion Cloud, NetSuite, cross-sell opportunities), but it also highlights meaningful near-term execution risks (backlog quality, margin progression, and data-gaps in signals). With data feeds currently down, there isn’t a reliable, data-confirmed setup to justify overweight exposure right now.
- A Hold is consistent with prudent risk management: you await clearer evidence that backlog translates into visible revenue, that margins can meaningfully improve, and that earnings guidance validates the AI/cloud trajectory.
- The plan’s logic to defer until data confirms multi-signal convergence remains sound: delaying until both technical and fundamental indicators align reduces the risk of a premature move into a noisy or overextended setup.

Concrete approach and triggers
- Maintain a data-driven, cautious posture until signals return:
  - If data returns: look for a confluence of:
    - Price above the 50-day and ideally above the 200-day SMA with a positive slope.
    - A MACD bullish cross or MACD/RSI divergence in a non-overbought zone.
    - ATR-validated volatility allowing a tight stop rather than wide exposure.
    - Management commentary/backlog visibility suggesting improving or sustainable revenue visibility and margin trajectory.
- Position sizing and risk controls (if/when entering):
  - Start small (1–2% of portfolio) and scale up only on confirmed setup.
  - Use defined stops (e.g., 1.5–2.0x ATR below entry) and consider a trailing stop to protect upside after a decisive move.
  - Consider hedging with a collar (long ORCL + short OTM calls or long puts) if near-term earnings risk is a concern.
- Earnings-oriented plan:
  - If the upcoming earnings print provides constructive AI/cloud commentary and margin signals, gradually increase exposure (e.g., add 1/2 position first, then the rest on stronger guidance).
  - If guidance is cautious or margins stall, pause and reassess; avoid forcing a breakout on uncertain data.
- Ongoing review:
  - Reassess post-earnings and after major AI/cloud news flow; adjust risk controls accordingly.
  - Keep monitoring broader IT budget and AI-cycle dynamics; don’t extrapolate a near-term print into multi-quarter victory without margin progress.

Operational notes
- I can attempt to pull the ORCL data feeds again to produce a data-backed, trader-focused read the moment they’re available. If you’d like, I’ll proceed with that data pull and deliver a concrete data-confirmed entry plan once signals come back.
- If you prefer to move now, a conditional starter could be considered only if a low-risk setup emerges per the criteria above, otherwise wait for the data recovery.

Would you like me to retry pulling the ORCL data feeds now and proceed with the conditional, data-confirmed plan to enter on the first favorable setup after the feeds return?

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
