I attempted to fetch NFLX data for the date range, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a temporary environment issue on the data fetch side. I’ll proceed with a carefully chosen set of indicators that provide complementary insights, so you have a solid framework to analyze NFLX once the data pull is working again. If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval right after this and then generate live readings.

Recommended indicator set for NFLX (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it tells: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s relevant for NFLX: Netflix often exhibits sustained trend phases around earnings and product cycles. The 50-day SMA acts as a practical yardstick for the intermediate trend and helps filter noise in choppy periods.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it tells: Long-term trend benchmark and major support/resistance level.
  - Why it’s relevant for NFLX: The 200-day view helps identify enduring regime changes (e.g., secular growth shifts, platform strategy outcomes). Golden/death cross context can offer strategic perspective on multi-month to multi-quarter horizons.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it tells: Short-term momentum and quicker shifts in price trajectory.
  - Why it’s relevant for NFLX: Useful for spotting early momentum moves around catalysts (earnings, content releases, subscriber metrics). It’s more responsive than the longer SMAs, helping with timely entries/exits when combined with longer-term trend filters.

- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it tells: Momentum and trend changes via the difference between two EMAs.
  - Why it’s relevant for NFLX: NFLX often experiences momentum-driven moves around earnings or user-growth data. MACD crossovers can help confirm trend changes when price is aligned with the broader trend.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - What it tells: Short-term momentum strength and potential reversal zones (overbought/oversold).
  - Why it’s relevant for NFLX: Can flag pullbacks or corrections within a bullish trend (divergence signals), but should be interpreted alongside the trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.

- boll
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it tells: Bollinger Middle (20-SMA) as a dynamic benchmark with volatility context via bands.
  - Why it’s relevant for NFLX: Helps identify breakouts or reversals when price moves relative to a volatility framework. In NFLX’s catalyst-driven environment, watching the interaction with bands can reveal when price is breaking out of typical ranges or reverting back toward the mean.

- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it tells: Average True Range, a direct measure of market volatility and range.
  - Why it’s relevant for NFLX: Useful for positioning sizing and stop placement around earnings or events that typically spike volatility. It provides a risk-management lens that adapts to changing volatility regimes.

- vwma
  - Category: Volume-Based Indicators
  - What it tells: Price action confirmed by volume, as VWMA weights price by volume traded.
  - Why it’s relevant for NFLX: Netflix often experiences volume surges around catalysts. VWMA helps validate moves with accompanying volume strength, reducing the likelihood of false breakouts that occur on low-volume days.

How to interpret these indicators together (read-on logic)
- Trend confirmation: If price sits above both 50_sma and 200_sma, and the close_10_ema is above price with MACD showing positive momentum, that supports a constructive longer-term trend with near-term upside bias.
- Momentum checks: Use MACD (and RSI) to confirm the strength behind moves flagged by trend indicators. A rising MACD with a rising RSI toward overbought can indicate a strong up move but watch RSI for potential pullbacks.
- Volatility context: ATR rising suggests mounting volatility (common around earnings). Use ATR to adjust position sizing and stop levels; Boll middle helps determine if the move is expanding within bands or signaling a breakout when price moves beyond band expectations.
- Volume validation: A price move above VWMA with robust volume adds conviction; a move on weak volume warrants caution, even if MA and MACD align.

Next steps
- If you want, I can retry fetching NFLX data now and then generate live indicator readings and a more precise, data-driven interpretation.
- I can also run more targeted stockstats indicator reports for NFLX (e.g., to get numeric values and trend signals) once data is accessible.
