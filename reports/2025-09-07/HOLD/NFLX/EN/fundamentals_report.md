Sorry — I’m hitting a system error trying to fetch the data right now. The attempts to pull SimFin balance sheet/cash flow/income statement and Finnhub insider sentiment/transactions for NFLX returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data module isn’t accessible at the moment.

Here are your options to proceed, and I can execute whichever you prefer:
- Retry now: I’ll attempt to fetch all data again in real time and then assemble the full report.
- Narrow scope: I can pull only insider sentiment and insider transactions (Finnhub) or only the most recent quarterly financial statements (SimFin) to get you something faster.
- Alternative cadence: If you’re okay with a best-effort qualitative analysis while the data access issue is being resolved, I can draft the report skeleton with placeholders for values and highlight where exact figures will go once the data is retrieved.

If you’d like me to retry, tell me to proceed and I’ll run the data fetch again immediately. Also, please let me know:
- Do you want the latest quarterly data (2025 Q2 or Q3, depending on availability) or trailing twelve months for the financials?
- Any specific metrics you especially care about (e.g., net income, operating margin, EBITDA, cash flow from operations, current ratio, debt-to-equity, insider sentiment score, insider buys/sells)?

Proposed structure for the full report (to help orient you):
- Executive snapshot
  - Quick verdict on fundamental health and near-term catalysts/risks
- Company profile
  - Business model, segments, and notable strategic shifts (e.g., pricing, content spend, subscriber dynamics)
- Core financials (latest period)
  - Income statement highlights: revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income
  - Balance sheet highlights: cash, debt, equity, assets, liquidity buffers
  - Cash flow highlights: operating, investing, financing cash flows
- Financial history and trend analysis
  - Multi-quarter/TTM trends on revenue growth, margins, profitability, cash generation, leverage
  - Any anomalies (seasonality, one-time items, shift in capex)
- Liquidity and solvency
  - Working capital trends, liquidity ratios, debt maturity profile
- Insider activity (past 30 days)
  - Sentiment signal from insiders, notable insider purchases/sales
- Valuation and market expectations (qualitative)
  - Growth expectations, competitive positioning, risk factors
- Trader-focused takeaways
  - Key catalysts, risks, and scenarios that could drive trade decisions
- Appendix
  - Data sources and any data caveats
  - Detailed data tables (when available)

And I’ll append a Markdown table at the end of the final report to organize key points clearly.

Would you like me to retry fetching all data now, or would you prefer I proceed with a narrowed scope or a best-effort qualitative draft in the meantime?
