Short answer: HOLD for now.

Rationale
- Your proposed plan already acknowledges strong long-run catalysts (APAC growth, ad-tier monetization, IP moat) but flags meaningful near-term uncertainties (margins, monetization pace, competition, and ad-market sensitivity). The current setup justifies preserving optionality rather than sizing into a higher conviction long position.
- A hold keeps capital under watch while you await tangible near-term progress on monetization levers and margin leverage. It also aligns with prudent risk controls given the high multiple and potential for near-term volatility around earnings/ads data.

Two-scenario model (illustrative, to anchor decisions)
- Base Case (no material monetization surprise)
  - Revenue growth (next 4 quarters): approximately 8–12% year-over-year
  - APAC ARPU uplift: 0–3% net effect
  - Ad-tier metrics: fill rates flat to modestly down; CPMs flat to -2% YoY
  - EBITDA margin: 15–18%
  - Free cash flow: roughly -2% to +1% of revenue (limited leverage from cost discipline)
  - Implication: Valuation remains a tight anchor; progress is real but gradual. Maintain Hold and watch for incremental data.
- Bull+APAC/Ads Upside
  - Revenue growth (next 4 quarters): 14–20% year-over-year
  - APAC ARPU uplift: 5–10% net effect
  - Ad-tier metrics: CPMs up 3–8% YoY; fill rates improving; incremental subs from ads
  - EBITDA margin: 19–23%
  - Free cash flow: 2–6% of revenue
  - Implication: If this scenario materializes with credible data (steady ad monetization, sustained APAC growth, margin expansion), the risk-reward tilts meaningfully higher and could justify a transition toward Buy.

Triggers to move from Hold toward Buy (need two or more confirmed, with credible data)
- APAC progress: sustained subscriber growth in APAC with rising ARPU and lower churn versus baseline.
- Ad-tier monetization: durable, multi-quarter improvements in fill rates and CPMs, with a meaningful EBITDA contribution.
- Margin trajectory: EBITDA margins stabilizing and trending higher on cost discipline and scale.
- Competitive/regulatory clarity: no material deterioration in competitive dynamics or alarming regulatory signals.
- Governance/insider signals: no persistent negative signals beyond typical market chatter; guidance remains coherent with progress.

Operational plan if triggers hit
- If credible two-signal confirmation occurs, escalate sizing toward Buy with a measured ramp (tiered entry) and tighten stop-loss rules.
- Maintain data discipline: rely on confirmed quarterly metrics; avoid reacting to partial or noisy data.

What I need to refresh with live data (if you want an updated call)
- Current APAC subscriber growth and ARPU trajectories
- Ad-tier metrics: fill rates, CPMs, ARPU from ads, and incremental subscriber impact
- Near-term EBITDA/margin trajectory and SG&A/content spend discipline
- Any notable insider activity or guidance updates

Would you like me to pull fresh data now to refresh these indicators and provide a data-driven reclassification (Hold to Buy) if and when two triggers are credibly satisfied? If you prefer, I can also provide a concrete two-scenario numeric model with updated bands once you share the latest figures.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
