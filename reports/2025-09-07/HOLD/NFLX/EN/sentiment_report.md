Sorry — I hit an internal tool error when trying to pull NFLX Reddit sentiment data for 2025-09-07. The Reddit data fetch returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the latest Reddit-based sentiment readings to include in the report right now. I can retry the data pull, try a different date window, or proceed using other available sources if you authorize them. Here are options:

- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again for 2025-09-07 or adjust to a nearby date.
- Alternate sources: If you have access to other sentiment/news feeds (Twitter/X, YouTube, stock news wires, or in-house datasets), I can analyze those for a more complete picture.
- Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis: I’ll summarize general sentiment drivers for NFLX and how they typically map to price action, with a caveat that Reddit-specific data is missing.

In the meantime, here is a structured draft of the long-form report you would get, plus a placeholder table to capture key points once the data is available.

Draft long-form report structure (NFLX)
