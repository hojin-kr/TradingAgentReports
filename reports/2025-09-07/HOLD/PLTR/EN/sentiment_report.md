I tried to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for PLTR (2025-09-07 through 2025-09-01), but the RedditStockInfo tool returned a FileNotFoundError. The backend for get_reddit_stock_info is currently unavailable. I can still move the analysis forward in two ways: (a) proceed with a robust framework and placeholders, and (b) re-run the data pull as soon as the tool is back online.

What I can do right now
- Provide a comprehensive analysis framework for PLTR that you can use once the Reddit data tool is restored.
- Deliver a ready-to-fill report skeleton with a clear data table and explanations so we can drop in the actual numbers and notes later.
- Compile a qualitative view from other available sources (public news, company announcements, major partnerships, product updates) to complement sentiment analysis, even without Reddit data.
- Prepare a finalized Markdown table template to organize key points in the report.

Proposed final deliverable structure (to be completed once sentiment data is available)
- Executive Summary
  - High-level sentiment takeaway for PLTR over the past week
  - Immediate trading implications (risk/volatility view, potential catalysts)
- Data Overview
  - Data sources used (Reddit, other social platforms, news)
  - Timeframe covered (past 7 days)
  - Sentiment scoring methodology (e.g., polarity score, engagement weighting)
- Daily Sentiment And Topics (one section per day)
  - Day
  - Sentiment score (Bullish/Neutral/Bearish, with numeric range)
  - Top topics/keywords
  - Notable posts and influencers
  - Any correlated PLTR news or events
  - Net impact signal (positive/negative/neutral)

  - Summary of significant PLTR news: earnings expectations, product updates, partnerships, regulatory or policy shifts
  - Market reaction and implied sentiment shift

- Trading Implications and Scenarios
  - Short-term guidance (e.g., implied volatility, potential breakouts/rotations)
  - Scenarios with thresholds (e.g., if daily sentiment > X, price move expectations)
- Key Metrics To Watch
  - Data points for ongoing monitoring (upcoming catalysts, sentiment spikes, notable posts)
- Final Assessment and Recommendation
  - Overall read on PLTR’s state and risk-adjusted implications

Data methodology notes you’ll see in the final report
- Sentiment: a composite polarity score per day derived from Reddit posts, weighted by engagement (upvotes, comments, velocity). Positive vs. negative sentiment bands defined to classify days as bullish, bearish, or neutral.
- Topics: extraction of recurring themes (e.g., AI product updates, customer wins, government contracts, earnings expectations) to explain sentiment shifts.
- Signal fusion: correlating sentiment with notable PLTR events and price action to interpret causality vs. correlation.

What I need from you to proceed with a full, data-backed report
- Confirm you’d like me to proceed with the framework now and fill in with data as soon as the Reddit tool is back online.
- Alternatively, confirm you’d like me to prioritize non-Reddit sources (news, press releases, and other social platforms) for a best-effort sentiment and news synthesis in the meantime.

Next steps
- I can re-run the Reddit data pull as soon as the tool is available again and then deliver the full long-form report with the daily sentiment breakdown, topics, and news alignment.
- If you’d prefer, I can start compiling a high-quality, source-grounded PLTR report focusing on non-Reddit inputs right away, with a strong emphasis on catalysts and qualitative sentiment. Then I’ll integrate Reddit data once the tool is functioning.

Would you like me to proceed with the framework now (and fill in Reddit data as soon as the tool is back), or should I focus on an interim non-Reddit-based report in the meantime?
