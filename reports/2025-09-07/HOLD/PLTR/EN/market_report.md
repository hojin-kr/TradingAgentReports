Status: Data retrieval for PLTR failed due to a tool environment error (FileNotFoundError) when calling get_YFin_data for 2024-09-01 to 2025-09-07. This looks like an internal issue rather than a PLTR-specific problem. I can retry fetching the data now or you can request a later retry. In the meantime, here is a focused, non-redundant set of indicators I would use for PLTR (Palantir) given a typical mixed-market to trending scenario, along with why they’re suitable and how I’d interpret them once data is available.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm whether PLTR is in an overall uptrend or downtrend relative to a 6–12 month window.
  - What to look for: Price above/below the 50-SMA as a trend filter; crossovers with price can hint at pullbacks or rallies respecting the trend.
- close_10_ema
  - Why: Responsive momentum gauge to capture quick shifts in price action and potential entry/exit points.
  - What to look for: Price crossing above/below the 10-EMA, or the 10-EMA crossing the 50-SMA as a short-term momentum cue.
- macd
  - Why: Core momentum indicator to detect changes in trend strength and direction.
  - What to look for: MACD line crossing above/below zero, or crossovers with the signal line, combined with price action for stronger confirmation.
- macds
  - Why: Smoother MACD signal line to confirm or filter MACD cross signals.
  - What to look for: MACD Signal line crossovers in the same direction as the MACD line for stronger entries/exits.
- macdh
  - Why: MACD histogram provides a quick view of momentum strength and divergence potential.
  - What to look for: Increasing histogram in the direction of the trend signals momentum strength; weakening histogram may foreshadow a reversal.
- rsi
  - Why: Momentum oscillator to gauge overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals.
  - What to look for: RSI cross back from overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) zones, or bullish/bearish divergences in conjunction with trend indicators.
- atr
  - Why: Volatility gauge for position sizing and risk management, useful to adapt stops to current market volatility.
  - What to look for: Rising ATR suggests expanding volatility (waster risk/room for move); falling ATR indicates compression and potential breakouts followed by consolidation.
- vwma
  - Why: Volume-weighted trend confirmation that blends price action with volume. Reduces false signals in low-volume periods.
  - What to look for: Price action aligning with VWMA direction and notable volume supporting moves, which strengthens validity of breakouts or pullbacks.

Notes on context and interpretation
- PLTR often moves with broad tech/AI sentiment and growth expectations. In a market with moderate volatility but positive tech sentiment, expect crossovers in MACD and RSI moves to be meaningful when supported by price action relative to the 50-SMA and 10-EMA.
- Combine signals: Favor trades where multiple indicators align (e.g., price above 50-SMA and 10-EMA, MACD bullish signal, RSI not in extreme overbought territory, rising ATR and VWMA confirming volume-backed move).
- Risk management: Use ATR for setting stop distances and consider VWMA as a directional filter in volume-spiked sessions to avoid chasing thin-volume moves.

What I’ll deliver once data is retrieved
- A detailed trend report for PLTR with visuals implied by the indicators above (price vs. moving averages, MACD lines, RSI levels, ATR, and VWMA alignment).
- A concise set of trade ideas (if you want them) with entry/exit criteria based on the 8 indicators, plus risk controls. I will stop short of giving explicit buy/sell/hold recommendations until you approve the data-backed signals.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now or on your cue. If you’d like me to keep trying, say “retry now” and I’ll attempt to fetch PLTR data again and then generate a full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators above.
- If you prefer a different date range or want to include a different set of indicators (up to 8 total), tell me and I’ll adjust accordingly.

Markdown table: Key indicators and rationale for PLTR
| Indicator | Rationale for PLTR | What to look for | Data dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend baseline; dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50-SMA; trend direction confirmation | Daily close data, 50-period window |
| close_10_ema | Responsive momentum probe | Price crossovers with 10-EMA; quick momentum shifts | Daily close data, 10-period window |
| macd | Core momentum trend changes | MACD line cross, zero-line cross, alignment with price action | Close prices; MACD parameters default to standard (12,26,9) |
| macds | Smoother momentum signal | Cross of MACD Signal with MACD line; corroborates MACD | MACD line data; signal line data |
| macdh | Momentum strength and divergence view | Histogram expansion/contraction; divergence cues | MACD histogram values |
| rsi | Overbought/oversold momentum filter | RSI around 30/70; divergences with price trend | RSI values (14-period default) |
| atr | Volatility-based risk management | Rising ATR implies higher volatility; adjust stops/size | True range data across periods |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed price trend | Price movement aligned with VWMA direction and volume spikes | Price data and volume data |

Status update:
- Data fetch currently blocked by a tool environment error. I can retry immediately or on your request. If you’d like me to proceed with the 8-indicator plan once data is available, say “retry now” and I’ll kick off another data pull and then produce the full, detailed report.
