Sorry — I hit an outage fetching the data I need from the tools right now. The attempts to pull insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the latest quarterly balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement for PLTR returned FileNotFoundError errors. I can’t produce a data-driven fundamental report at this moment.

What I can do now
- Provide a thorough, structured framework for the PLTR fundamental report and a qualitative overview you can use immediately.
- Outline exactly which data points I’ll pull as soon as the data sources are available again, and what to look for in each section.
- When the data sources come back online, I’ll fill in the figures, run the calculations, and deliver the full, detailed report with a final Markdown table of key points.

Preliminary qualitative overview of Palantir (PLTR)
- Company profile
  - Palantir Technologies is a US-based software company focused on data integration, analytics, and platform services.
  - Primary products and platforms:
    - Gotham: historically focused on government, defense, intelligence sectors.
    - Foundry: a commercial platform designed for enterprise customers across multiple industries (manufacturing, healthcare, financials, etc.).
  - Business model: platform licensing and deployment across complex data environments, with recurring revenue from enterprise and government customers. Revenue growth tends to be driven by expansion in existing multi-year contracts and new large enterprise/government wins.

- Market and competitive context
  - Competitors include enterprise data platforms and analytics providers (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, IBM, Microsoft Azure-based analytics, etc.). Palantir differentiates with heavy emphasis on data integration in complex, regulated environments and long-term large-scale deployments.
  - Key risks include customer concentration (large multi-year contracts with government and select enterprise accounts), contract negotiations (pricing and scope), regulatory/compliance requirements, and competitive pressure on platform efficiency and ease of integration.

- Business drivers and qualitative insights
  - Government exposure: Gotham revenue is highly contingent on government budgets, procurement cycles, and policy/regulatory shifts. A favorable government funding cycle can meaningfully boost revenue growth and visibility; a slowdown can weigh on top-line growth.
  - Foundry adoption: Growth in Foundry depends on enterprise digital transformation, data modernization initiatives, and the ability to scale deployments across lines of business. High customer stickiness is typical once a platform is embedded into data workflows.
  - Operating efficiency: Palantir has historically invested heavily in R&D and go-to-market efforts to scale platform adoption. Margin levels and cash generation are sensitive to mix between high-touch services vs. scalable software licensing.
  - Cash flow and profitability: The company has pursued a path toward improved cash flow with greater scale, but profitability in earlier periods was affected by sales investments, contract structure, and mix. Free cash flow generation remains a key watch for traders.

- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (what I’ll look for when data is available)
  - Insider sentiment: whether internal views have turned more positive or negative over the past 30 days, including any notable shifts around new contract wins, product updates, or guidance changes.
  - Insider transactions: frequency and size of insider buys or sells, especially around earnings releases, major contract announcements, or strategic pivots. Large insider purchases can be a bullish signal; consistent selling could raise caution.

- Key risks to monitor
  - Government exposure risk and procurement cycle sensitivity.
  - Customer concentration risk with large multi-year contracts.
  - Competitive dynamics and pricing pressure in a growing but competitive data platform space.
  - Execution risk in scaling Foundry across diverse industries and regulatory environments.

Proposed Markdown table (to be populated with data)
- I’ll append a table like the following once data are available. It lists data points vs. sources and status so you can quickly see what’s filled and what’s pending.

Next steps and options
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now. The platform may be experiencing a temporary data access issue, and I can attempt to fetch PLTR data again as soon as it’s available.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with a qualitative, assumption-forward analysis based on historical context and typical PLTR patterns, clearly labeling any figures as placeholders until the data is retrieved.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
1) Retry data retrieval now and then deliver the full data-driven report with the final Markdown table, or
2) Proceed with a qualitative, hypothesis-driven overview (no specific financial figures) and a ready-to-fill template for when data become available.
