# Investment Plan

Here’s my take. On balance, the bull case for NVIDIA is more persuasive than the bear case, so I recommend a Buy. 

First, the key points:  
From the bull side we have huge secular tailwinds—AI, data centers, gaming and even automotive—where NVIDIA’s GPUs and ecosystem (CUDA, strong developer adoption) give it a genuine moat. Revenues are running near $46 billion for the next quarter, the H100 Tensor Core chips keep it at the tech frontier, and momentum indicators (stock above 50- and 200-day SMAs, healthy MACD and RSI) suggest there’s room to run before an overbought reversal. And although insiders have sold shares, that rarely correlates directly with near-term fundamentals; it’s often simply liquidity or diversification.

On the bear side the concerns are real—greater competition from AMD and Intel, regulatory and geopolitical headwinds in China, volatility around earnings and insider activity that may spook risk-averse investors. There’s also the classic caution that projections for a $15 trillion AI market could be overly optimistic if growth disappoints or execution stumbles.

But here’s why I side with the bulls: NVIDIA’s lead in the most computationally demanding workloads is not easy to replicate, and competitors are still playing catch-up. The company has shown an ability to innovate (just look at the leap from the A100 to the H100), and it’s branching into software stacks and services that deepen its ecosystem lock-in. Yes, regulation in China matters, but NVIDIA is diversifying end markets globally and shifting more R&D and sales focus to allied regions. Short-term price swings and insider sales don’t outweigh a multiyear growth runway driven by AI, cloud, and edge computing trends.

Investment Plan for a Buy recommendation

1. Positioning and Sizing  
   – Deploy roughly 5–7 percent of equity capital into a core NVIDIA position.  
   – Consider dollar-cost averaging over the next 4–6 weeks to mitigate entry-timing risk, especially around any market dips or volatility ahead of earnings.

2. Entry Strategy  
   – Start with an initial tranche at current levels.  
   – Place conditional orders to add more shares if the stock dips 5–8 percent below today’s price, using limit orders to ensure you don’t chase spikes.  

3. Risk Management  
   – Use a 10 percent trailing stop-loss to protect against a sudden reversal, especially in the event of an earnings miss or adverse regulatory news.  
   – Keep total exposure to any single tech name below 10 percent of the equity portfolio to maintain diversification.

4. Monitoring and Review  
   – Watch the upcoming earnings report closely for guidance on data-center orders and AI revenue growth.  
   – Track chip supply constraints, pricing trends, and any updates on China export licenses.  
   – Revisit the thesis every quarter: if NVIDIA misses consensus by more than 5 percent or if a competitor releases a genuinely superior product, be prepared to trim.

5. Time Horizon and Exit Criteria  
   – Plan to hold for at least 12–18 months to capture the full AI cycle.  
   – Target a first-phase sell zone of 20–30 percent above cost if momentum accelerates, then re-evaluate the position for potential scaling out or riding deeper gains.

Learning from the past, I’ll avoid overreacting to short-term noise—insider trades or single-quarter missteps—and stay focused on the long-term market leadership and technology adoption curve. By scaling in gradually, using disciplined risk controls, and monitoring fundamental catalysts, we strike a balance between seizing the upside and protecting capital. In my view, NVIDIA today is a Buy.
