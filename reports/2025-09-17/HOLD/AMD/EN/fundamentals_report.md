Thanks for the nudge. I’m running into a temporary issue pulling the data from the financial data tools right now (the tool layer is returning FileNotFoundError). I can’t fetch the SimFin and Finnhub data at the moment to fill in the numbers and specific itemized insights. Here’s how we can proceed:

What I can do now
- Provide a comprehensive AMD fundamental report framework you can use once the data pulls succeed.
- Include explicit guidance on what to look for in each section, plus interpretive notes to help traders act on the data.
- Include a Markdown table at the end to organize key points, even if some fields are placeholders until the data is retrieved.

Provisional AMD fundamental analysis framework (ready to populate with actual figures when data access is restored)
1) Company profile and business model
- What to cover:
  - Company overview (AMD’s core segments: Computing, Data Center, Graphics, Embedded)
  - Revenue mix by segment and geography
  - Competitive positioning (Intel/Nvidia as peers; advantages like Zen/EPYC, RDNA, 3D V-Cache)
  - Capital structure and liquidity stance
- What to watch for traders:
  - Shifts in segment mix (e.g., data center growth vs. consumer PC demand)
  - Margin expansion or compression drivers (product mix, supply chain, ASPs)

2) Most recent quarterly results (qualitative summary to be filled with numbers)
- What to cover:
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income (or loss), EPS
  - Year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth rates
  - Cash flow indicators (operating cash flow, free cash flow)
  - Any one-time items, cost-cutting actions, or restructuring impacts
- What to watch for traders:
  - Margin trajectory (gross and operating)
  - Acceleration in data center or client compute/graphics demand
  - Any guidance for the next quarter or full year

3) Balance sheet highlights (key items)
- What to cover:
  - Cash, short-term investments, total debt, net debt
  - Working capital changes and current ratio
  - Asset quality signals (inventory levels vs. days of supply, receivables)
- What to watch for traders:
  - Strength of liquidity to fund R&D and capex
  - Debt burden and interest coverage

4) Income statement highlights
- What to cover:
  - Top-line trends by quarter and year
  - Major cost components (R&D, SG&A, depreciation)
  - Non-operating items if relevant
- What to watch for traders:
  - R&D intensity vs. growth outcomes (product roadmap implications)
  - Operating leverage or leverage reversal signals

5) Cash flow statement highlights
- What to cover:
  - Operating cash flow, capital expenditures, free cash flow
  - Cash conversion efficiency
- What to watch for traders:
  - Free cash flow durability to fund buybacks, dividends, or strategic investments

6) Insider sentiment and insider transactions
- What to cover:
  - Recent insider buys/sells and overall sentiment (short window, e.g., past 15 days)
  - Interpretation of insider confidence vs. company fundamentals
- What to watch for traders:
  - Consistent insider buying near key product cycles or guidance shifts can be constructive; insider selling during strong results may warrant deeper review

7) Financial history and trend analysis
- What to cover:
  - Revenue growth trajectory, gross/margin trends, operating margin trend
  - Leverage and capital structure evolution
  - R&D intensity and innovation cycle milestones (new architectures, process nodes)
- What to watch for traders:
  - Sustained margin expansion or compression
  - Structural improvements in cost base or scale benefits from data center demand

8) Competitive landscape and macro factors
- What to cover:
  - AMD’s share dynamics in compute, data center, and graphics markets
  - Supply chain health, foundry relationships, and fab capacity (including 7nm/5nm family notes if relevant)
  - Demand environments (PC refresh cycles, data center capex, AI workloads)
- What to watch for traders:
  - Competitive threats or wins, and how AMD’s roadmap translates to revenue visibility

9) Risks and catalysts
- What to cover:
  - Key risks: supply chain, product execution, competition, growth in AI requires new accelerators
  - Catalysts: new product launches, data center wins, earnings guidance changes, AI cycle tailwinds
- What to watch for traders:
  - How near-term catalysts align with valuation and risk tolerance

10) Trading implications and potential strategies
- What to cover:
  - Short-term catalysts, price reaction expectations, and risk controls
  - Scenario analysis (bullish, base, bearish) with implied revenue/margin assumptions
- What to watch for traders:
  - Entry/exit points around earnings, product announcements, or guidance updates

11) Methodology notes
- Data sources used (SimFin balance sheet, income statement, cash flow; Finnhub insider sentiment and transactions)
- Time frame (past week data, current date 2025-09-17)
- Limitations (data gaps, reconciling quarterly vs. annual reporting)

End-of-report Markdown table (structure for key takeaways)
Please note: The table is designed to be filled with actual figures once the data pulls succeed. I’m providing the format and example placeholders you can replace with real values.

- Table: Summary of Key Points (to fill with data)
| Area | Key Metric / Insight | Data Point (TBD) | Data Source | Trader Implication (TBD) |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Revenue trend | Year-over-year growth rate | TBD | SimFin Income Statement | Positive growth supports upside; weakness may warrant caution |
| Gross margin | Gross margin percentage | TBD | SimFin Income Statement | Margin expansion signals efficiency gains; compression may pressure profits |
| Operating margin | Operating margin percentage | TBD | SimFin Income Statement | Higher margins suggest pricing power or cost control |
| Free cash flow | FCF yield / absolute FCF | TBD | SimFin Cash Flow | Positive FCF supports shareholder-friendly actions; negative FCF could signal investment needs |
| Liquidity | Current ratio / cash position | TBD | SimFin Balance Sheet | Strong liquidity reduces funding risk; weak liquidity could pressure valuations |
| Debt | Net debt / EBITDA | TBD | SimFin Balance Sheet / Income Statement | Leverage risk; interest coverage matters for earnings stability |
| Insider sentiment | Net sentiment in past 15 days | TBD | Finnhub Insider Sentiment | Positive sentiment can corroborate fundamentals; mixed signals require caution |
| Insider transactions | Net insider buys/sells past 15 days | TBD | Finnhub Insider Transactions | Buying may indicate confidence; selling could signal caution or liquidity needs |
| Key risk | Top risk factor | TBD | Company filings / market context | A high-risk factor could cap upside or require hedges |
| Catalyst | Near-term catalyst | TBD | Company guidance / product roadmap | Potential price move if catalyst materializes |

What I can do next (once data access is restored)
- Re-run the data pulls for AMD (quarterly cadence) and generate a fully populated report with the actual numbers, KPIs, and the finalized insider sentiment/transactions view.
- Produce a finalized Markdown-formatted report with a completed table of key takeaways, including precise dates and figures.

Would you like me to retry pulling the data now and generate the full, numbers-backed report in one go, or would you prefer I proceed with the qualitative framework and placeholders shipped in a ready-to-fill template? If you want me to retry, I’ll attempt again as soon as the data layer is available.
