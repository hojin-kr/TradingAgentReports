Recommendation: Hold AMD now.

Rationale
- The provided plan presents a credible bull case (ROCm ecosystem, 2nm/Zen 5 ramp, enterprise collaborations) but also credible near-term risks (CUDA lock-in, ramp timing, policy/geopolitical exposure, macro data-center headwinds). The near-term catalysts are not yet proven to deliver durable revenue/gross-margin uplift, so a buy today may be paying for future optimism rather than confirmed fundamentals.
- A Hold preserves optionality: you benefit from potential ROCm-driven upside if enterprise adoption accelerates, while limiting downside if near-term catalysts underwhelm or external risks intensify.

Actionable guidance
- If you currently own AMD:
  - Maintain a core position with risk controls. Consider a trailing stop or ATR-based stop to guard against volatility around earnings or macro news.
  - Reduce incremental risk exposure if you’re chasing gains with high concentration in AMD; use hedges (puts or collars) around major catalysts.
- If you’re considering entering:
  - Wait for clearer confirmation signals before sizing up. Look for durable ROCm traction (multi-quarter enterprise deals with margin uplift) and a credible 2nm/Zen 5 ramp with measurable data-center efficiency gains.
  - Consider a hedged entry (e.g., long stock with a protective put or a collar) to cap downside while leaving upside opportunity if catalysts land.

Catalysts and triggers to watch
- ROCm milestones: enterprise contract wins, multi-quarter revenue/margin improvement signals.
- 2nm/Zen 5 ramp: timing, yields, real-world data-center efficiency gains.
- Strategic partnerships and enterprise deals (Absci/Oracle-type traction) with measurable compute revenue impact.
- Policy/geopolitical updates and macro data-center demand trends.
- Technical setup: price action showing constructive signals (clear trend in price > 50-/200-day MA, positive MACD, not-overbought RSI) with rising volatility to accompany breakout potential.

Lessons applied
- Use multiple signal streams (fundamental ROCm traction, hardware ramp timing, macro/policy context) rather than a single catalyst.
- Tie thesis to verifiable near-term outcomes (visible enterprise wins and margin impact) instead of marketing narratives.
- Maintain explicit action triggers (Buy/Sell/Hold) rather than relying on vague expectations.
- Employ risk controls (position sizing, stops, hedging) to protect against uncertain near-term catalysts.

Final stance
- HOLD now, with proactive risk management and clearly defined triggers for upgrading to Buy or downgrading to Sell as new data arrives.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
