# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD’s AI/data-center roadmap hinges on ROCm traction and efficiency gains from Zen 5/2nm. Near-term risks include CUDA dominance, ramp timing, and policy headwinds; hold with risk controls.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold. Confidence: Medium.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- What AMD does: designs CPUs, GPUs, and software for data centers, gaming, and edge devices.
- ROCm traction: ROCm is AMD’s open software platform for AI compute; growth here could expand enterprise revenue beyond hardware.
- Diversified platform: a multi-vertical strategy across data center, gaming/graphics, and edge creates cross-sell opportunities (CPU + GPU + software).
- Real-world signals: enterprise collaborations show growing demand for AI compute beyond pure hardware.
- Efficiency gains from next-gen tech: Zen 5 and 2nm process are expected to boost performance per watt and lower total cost of ownership for customers.
- Cautious outlook: meaningful upside needs several catalysts to align; near-term progress could be uneven.

## Risks To Watch
- CUDA dominance risk: Nvidia’s ecosystem and benchmarks could limit ROCm adoption.
- Ramp timing and supply: timing, yields, and ramp of Zen 5, X3D, and 2nm could push growth out.
- Policy and geopolitical exposure: export controls and geopolitical tensions can reduce revenue visibility.
- Near-term catalysts may disappoint: optimistic scenarios rely on multiple positive events occurring together.
- Macro data-center demand: hyperscalers’ capex and enterprise AI budgets can swing AMD’s near-term trajectory.
