I tried to fetch AMD data and run the 8 indicators you asked for, but the data service returned errors (FileNotFoundError) for the data retrieval step. I can retry immediately if you’d like, but in the meantime here’s a detailed plan with the selected indicators and why they’re suited for AMD given a typical mid- to near-term trading window. I’ll also include a structured table at the end for quick reference.

Selected indicators (8 total) and rationale
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  - What it tells you: The intermediate-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level.
  - Why it's good for AMD: AMD often moves with tech cycles and product/AI demand news. The 50 SMA helps identify a manageable trend horizon (weeks to a couple of months) and can serve as a dynamic floor in pullbacks.

- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  - What it tells you: The longer-term trend context and major support/resistance benchmark.
  - Why it's good for AMD: Helps distinguish secular trend bias (bullish/bearish) amid quarterly volatility. A price above the 200 SMA generally aligns with a longer-term bullish stance; a cross below can warn of longer-term risk.

- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  - What it tells you: Short-term momentum and quicker trend shifts than the 50/200 SMAs.
  - Why it's good for AMD: Useful for timing entries/exits around earnings or catalyst events. It reacts faster to momentum changes, which is helpful in a volatile semiconductor stock environment.

- macd: MACD line
  - What it tells you: Momentum and trend-change signals through the difference of two EMAs.
  - Why it's good for AMD: MACD crossovers can precede or confirm changes in the price trend, especially around product launches, demand news, or supply chain updates that affect AMD’s stock movement.

- macds: MACD Signal
  - What it tells you: The smoothing of the MACD line; crossovers with MACD line generate signal confirmation.
  - Why it's good for AMD: Using MACD vs MACD Signal helps reduce false positives from MACD alone, giving more robust momentum signals during choppy periods.

- macdh: MACD Histogram
  - What it tells you: The momentum strength and divergence between MACD and its signal.
  - Why it's good for AMD: Divergence or expanding/contracting histogram bars can warn of weakening momentum before price turns, which is valuable around earnings or guidance updates.

- rsi: RSI (relative strength index)
  - What it tells you: Short-to-medium momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why it's good for AMD: Helps identify potential reversals when price has moved too far in one direction, but should be used in conjunction with trend indicators to avoid chasing false signals in strong trends.

- atr: Average True Range
  - What it tells you: Market volatility and how much price is typically moving each day.
  - Why it's good for AMD: Useful for setting stop levels and sizing positions in a stock known for volatility around earnings or AI/semiconductor cycles. Helps calibrate risk.

What to watch for (interpretation guidelines)
- Trend context
  - If price is above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, bias is bullish on a medium-to-long horizon; look for pullbacks toward the 50 SMA as potential entries if momentum stays positive (confirmed by MACD and RSI).
  - If price is below both SMAs, bias is bearish or range-bound; you’d want stronger momentum confirmations before long entries.

- Momentum signals
  - MACD line crossing above MACD Signal and positive MACD histogram suggests momentum acceleration to the upside; look for confirmation with price staying above short-term averages (10 EMA) and RSI staying above midline without overbought risk.
  - MACD histogram increasing in the positive zone (macdh rising) reinforces upward momentum; a shrinking histogram or a negative cross can precede a pullback.

- Momentum strength and reversals
  - RSI near or above 70 can indicate overbought risk, but in strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; watch for bearish RSI divergences (price making new highs while RSI does not).
  - RSI near or below 30 can indicate oversold conditions, but again, confirm with trend context to avoid catching a falling knife in a bear market or a sector-wide downturn.

- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising implies higher daily ranges; this means wider stops and potentially larger position sizing adjustments. In AMD, which can move sharply on earnings and AI-related news, ATR helps you set realistic stops.
  - If ATR contracts and price stabilizes, it may indicate consolidation; combine with MACD/rsi cues before making a decisive move.

Next steps if you want me to proceed
- I can retry fetching the AMD data (AMD, from 2025-06-01 to 2025-09-17) and then compute the 8 indicators exactly as requested, followed by a detailed trend/report with concrete signals for the period.
- Alternatively, if you have a local CSV or another data source, you can share it and I’ll compute the indicators against that data.

Proposed 8-indicator setup summary
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi

Markdown table: key points to organize the indicators and their uses
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AMD | How to use (entry/exit considerations) | Key caveats |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Intermediate trend, dynamic support/resistance | Signals medium-term trend direction; pullbacks to 50 SMA as potential entries in uptrends | Use with 10 EMA and MACD for timing; expect lag relative to price | Lagging indicator; best used with faster signals |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms overall market/trend bias; golden/death cross context | Use to assess strategic bias; prefer long entries when price above 200 SMA | Slower to react; may miss shorter-term moves |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts in momentum; potential entry timing | Use for entry/exits around catalysts; confirm with MACD/RSI | Prone to noise in choppy markets |
| macd | Momentum and trend change | Crosses indicate momentum shifts | Bullish when MACD > Signal; bearish when MACD < Signal | Susceptible to whipsaws in low-volatility periods; confirm with other signals |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Confirmation of MACD cross signals | Use with MACD cross to trigger entries/-exits | Adds another layer; can lag MACD line |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence | Rising positive histogram confirms momentum; falling/negative signals potential reversals | Can be volatile; combine with price action |
| rsi | Relative strength momentum | Overbought/oversold context and divergences | RSI > 70 overbought; RSI < 30 oversold; watch for divergences | Trends can keep RSI elevated for long periods; use with trend signals |
| atr | Volatility/true range | Measures current volatility; informs stops and sizing | Higher ATR → wider stops; adjust risk exposure accordingly | Reactive measure; does not predict direction |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and proceed to compute the exact indicator values for AMD for the requested window. Just say “retry” and I’ll attempt again immediately.
