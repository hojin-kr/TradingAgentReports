Apologies—the Reddit stock data tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch the AMD Reddit sentiment data for 2025-09-17 through 2025-09-11 right now.

Here are your options to move this forward:

- Option A: I retry automatically and notify you as soon as the tool responds. I can set up a short wait-and-retry loop if you’d like.
- Option B: I proceed with a qualitative AMD sentiment analysis using non-tool sources (public news, known market sentiment patterns) and clearly label it as not including day-by-day Reddit data. I’ll omit the exact Reddit-day-by-day sentiment scores but provide a structured narrative and implications for traders based on typical themes observed in public discourse.
- Option C: You provide permission to proceed with a best-effort structure now, and when the tool comes back, I fill in the day-by-day Reddit data and finalize the report.

If you choose Option B or C, here’s how I’ll deliver the final long report (with a Markdown table at the end for key takeaways):

What the report will include (once data is available or if we proceed with a qualitative path):
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment backdrop for AMD, key catalysts, and risks.
- Day-by-day sentiment proxy (if data available): Positive/Neutral/Negative trend on Reddit, top themes per day, and notable posts (upvotes/comments) with relevance to AMD’s price/action.
- Thematic frontier: AI/datacenter demand, GPU supply/availability, driver stability, competitive landscape with NVIDIA, product cycle expectations (Ryzen/EPYC/RADEON), guidance from recent earnings or events.
- Public news overlay: recent AMD headlines (product launches, partnerships, earnings, guidance, regulatory notes) and how they align with Reddit sentiment.
- Sentiment vs. price/volume: how sentiment signals historically translated into price or volatility moves for AMD in recent weeks.
- Risk factors and counterpoints: potential headwinds (supply/demand shifts, crypto GPU demand, macro factors) and hedging ideas.
- Trading implications: scenarios for bulls, bears, and neutral traders; suggested watch points and potential catalysts.
- Data caveats: limitations of Reddit sentiment (noise, bot activity, sample bias) and how to interpret alongside fundamentals and technicals.
- Appendix: glossary of sentiment signals and a structured Markdown table for quick reading.

Proposed Markdown table structure (to be filled with actual data when available):
- Date | Reddit Sentiment (Pos/Neu/Neg) | Top Themes | Notable Posts (sample) | Implied Price/Vol Impact | Data Source
- ... (one row per date in the covered window)

If you want me to proceed with Option B (qualitative path) or Option C (structured plan with data as soon as the tool works), tell me which you prefer. I’ll proceed accordingly and deliver the full long-form AMD report with a clean Markdown table once I have data, or immediately with a qualitative narrative if you choose Option B.
