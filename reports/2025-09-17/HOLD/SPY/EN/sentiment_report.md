Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit/stock news data for SPY, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError, which indicates a backend issue rather than a user input problem. I can’t pull the Reddit stock-info feed right now. Here’s how we can proceed and what I can deliver in the meantime:

What happened
- The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError repeatedly for ticker SPY on 2025-09-17.
- It’s a tool issue, not a problem with your request. I don’t have an alternative data source in this session to replace it, so I can’t produce the live sentiment table from Reddit right this moment.

What I can do now
- Provide a high-quality, trader-focused framework and qualitative analysis for SPY based on general market dynamics, news flow, and typical sentiment catalysts that we would expect to see on social media and news (without the exact day-by-day Reddit data).
- Prepare a robust long-form report outline with a placeholder for sentiment data, so once the tool is back, we can plug in the real numbers and posts.
- Deliver a detailed Markdown table summarizing key points, as requested, with clearly labeled sections to populate once data becomes available.

Proposed next steps (when the tool is back online)
- Re-run the Reddit stock-info query for SPY for the last 7–10 days (or the exact range you want) and compile:
  - Daily sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Top themes (e.g., market momentum, Fed policy expectations, inflation commentary, geopolitical risk)
  - Notable posts/news items driving sentiment
  - Potential sentiment turning points aligned with macro events (earnings seasons, CPI/PPI releases, FOMC meetings)
- Synthesize with public news (headline-driven) to produce a cohesive sentiment + news narrative.
- Deliver a final long report with actionable insights for traders and investors, plus a detailed Markdown table.

Here is a draft of the long-report structure I’ll deliver once data is available, followed by a ready-to-fill Markdown table:

Draft structure (to be populated with SPY-specific data)
- Executive snapshot
  - Quick read on overall sentiment trend (bullish/bearish/mixed)
  - Key risk/tilt factors identified in social chatter
- Day-by-day sentiment trajectory
  - Summary of sentiment delta by day
  - Notable posts/topics driving shifts
- Thematic analysis
  - Macro/policy (Fed expectations, rates, inflation commentary)
  - Earnings/sector rotation (if any earnings-related chatter affects SPY)
  - Technicals and algorithmic/volatility themes (VIX, options activity)
  - Geopolitics/global macro events
- News flow synthesis
  - Top headlines in the past 7–10 days and their likely impact on SPY
  - Compare social sentiment vs. headline sentiment
- Risk and opportunity implications for traders
  - Short-term directional bets vs. range-bound risk
  - Implied volatility dynamics and options positioning considerations
  - Levels to watch (support/resistance, moving averages, trend lines)
- Trading ideas and cautions
  - High-conviction setups if sentiment support aligns with price action
  - Scenarios to monitor (positive vs. negative sentiment catalysts)
- Limitations and data caveats
  - Data quality, representativeness, and potential biases in social sentiment

Markdown table (to organize key points, to be populated with real data)
- This table is designed to be filled after sentiment/news data is available. For now, you can use it as a scaffold.

Table: Key SPY Sentiment & News Signals (to be populated)
- Columns: Theme, Day Range, Positive Sentiment %, Negative Sentiment %, Neutral, Top Headlines/Posts, Implication for SPY, Trader Takeaway
- Rows (examples to fill in after data): Macro/Narrative, Fed/Rate Expectations, Inflation Talk, Earnings Signals, Market Breadth, Technical Levels, Options Activity, Geopolitics, Retail Investor Sentiment, Sector Rotation

If you’d like, I can proceed with a qualitative, non-data-specific version of the full report now, clearly labeled as provisional and not sentiment-grounded, and then plug in the exact Reddit data as soon as the tool is functioning again. Please confirm which path you prefer:

- Option A: Wait for tool reset and I deliver the full data-backed SPY sentiment + news report with the Markdown table populated.
- Option B: I provide a comprehensive qualitative SPY report now (no Reddit data), plus the ready-to-fill Markdown table outline, ready for data insertion once the tool is back.
- Option C: You provide alternative data sources you want me to incorporate (e.g., other social platforms or public sentiment datasets) and I’ll integrate those as available.

I’m ready to proceed with any option you choose.
