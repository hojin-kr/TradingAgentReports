I attempted to fetch QQQ data for 2024-09-17 to 2025-09-17, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a environment/tool glitch rather than a market signal. I can retry the data pull now or as soon as the backend is available. In the meantime, I’ll proceed with a focused set of indicators and a detailed plan for interpretation so you’re ready once the data loads.

Recommended indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these 8 are chosen
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify ongoing trend context (bullish if price above and rising relative to 50SMA; bearish if below and diverging).
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend anchor. Useful for confirming macro regime (golden/death cross considerations) and to filter trades that go against the major trend.
- close_10_ema: Quick reaction to short-term momentum shifts. Useful for early entries/exits, but should be filtered with longer-term indicators to avoid noise.
- macd, macds, macdh: A complete MACD framework for momentum/trend change. MACD line vs MACD signal cross (bullish/bearish), with histogram showing momentum strength and potential divergences.
- rsi: Momentum strength and potential reversal signals, with standard overbought/oversold cues (commonly 70/30). Divergence with price can precede reversals, especially when aligned with trend context.
- atr: Volatility gauge for risk management and position sizing. Helps set stops, adjust risk, and understand regime shifts (rising ATR often means larger price swings).

How to interpret them together (framework you can apply once data arrives)
- Trend core (50SMA and 200SMA)
  - If price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA, bullish macro trend is favored; look for pullbacks to the 50SMA or 200SMA as potential support and buy/long entries aligned with MACD momentum.
  - If price is below both, bearish macro trend; look for rallies to resist near 50SMA/200SMA as potential short-entry zones.
  - Crossovers like a golden cross (50SMA above 200SMA) are supportive of bullish drift, but confirm with momentum indicators.
- Momentum timing (10 EMA, MACD family, RSI)
  - MACD bullish signals (MACD line crossing above MACD signal) with an increasing histogram (MACD_H rising) corroborate a trend change or continuation in the bullish direction, especially if price is above major moving averages.
  - RSI: If RSI climbs into the 60s–70s in an uptrend and not yet overbought, it supports sustained upside. If RSI breaks above 70 and MACD remains bullish, be cautious of a potential pullback; look for divergences or failure signals.
  - RSI divergences (price making new highs while RSI fails to do so) can warn of upcoming consolidation or reversal, particularly when macro trend is already stretched.
- Volatility context (ATR)
  - Rising ATR indicates increasing volatility; adjust stop losses and position sizes accordingly. In high-volatility regimes, rely more on MACD/RSI confirmations before entering trades.
  - Low ATR with consistent MACD/RSI signals can imply steadier moves—good for swing-style entries with clearer stop placements.
- Trade construction notes
  - Favor high-probability setups where trend direction (via 50SMA/200SMA) aligns with MACD momentum and RSI momentum readings.
  - Use ATR to set initial stop distances; consider widening stops in rising-ATR regimes or tightening in contracting volatility.
  - Be cautious of noise in the shorter term; if price action is choppy, rely more on MACD/MACD histogram confirmation and trend filters rather than RSI extremes alone.

Market-context considerations for QQQ (without any specific numeric readings yet)
- QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) tends to be more sensitive to tech sector momentum and AI-related catalysts. In a rally, you’d expect price to stay above major moving averages, MACD to show constructive momentum, RSI to trend higher but avoid overbought extremes, and ATR to show periodic spikes around breakouts or news-driven moves.
- In pullbacks, price testing the 50SMA or 200SMA with a negative MACD cross, RSI turning down (or failing to make new highs) and ATR ticking up would be typical signals to manage risk or look for short entries if the macro trend supports it.

Next steps
- I will retry the data fetch as soon as the backend is available. Once I have the actual data, I’ll produce a detailed, data-driven trend report using the eight indicators above, including:
  - Current price vs. 50SMA and 200SMA
  - MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram status
  - RSI level and any notable divergences
  - ATR-derived volatility context
  - A synthesized assessment of bullish/bearish setups with actionable entry/exit/risk management ideas
- I’ll also append a comprehensive Markdown table summarizing the indicators, their signals, and recommended actions for quick reference.

Provisional report summary (no data yet)
- With the selected eight indicators, we’ll have a balanced view: two long-term trend anchors (50SMA, 200SMA), a responsive short-term momentum tool (10 EMA), a robust momentum trio (MACD, MACDS, MACDH), a momentum/overbought-oversold gauge (RSI), and a volatility/risk tool (ATR). This combination minimizes redundancy and provides complementary insights across trend, momentum, and volatility.

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now or as soon as the tool back end is ready. Also, tell me if you prefer a slightly different mix (e.g., swap ATR for boll/boll_ub/boll_lb or include vwma for volume-confirmed trends), and I’ll adjust the indicator list accordingly.
