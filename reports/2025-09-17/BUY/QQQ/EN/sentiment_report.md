I tried to fetch the Reddit stock info for QQQ (2025-09-17), but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I’m unable to retrieve the Reddit data right now due to a tool error.

What I can do next (your call):
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately.
- Retry later: I can wait a moment and try again in a few minutes.
- Alternate approach: I can proceed with a detailed qualitative analysis of sentiment and news using other available sources and lay out the framework for the final report, and we can fill in Reddit specifics as soon as the tool is working again.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with a structured plan (without the Reddit feed data for now), here’s how I’ll approach the long report for QQQ (the tech-heavy ETF proxy) and what you’ll get:
- Overview: Brief current-state snapshot of QQQ (as an ETF linked to NASDAQ-100) and the macro backdrop (rates, AI-driven tech momentum, macro risks).
- Daily sentiment frame (Past week): A synthesis of general public sentiment signals across social media, forums, and headlines, with a focus on notable swing days and driver themes (e.g., tech earnings chatter, AI hype, rate-change narratives). I’ll clearly mark uncertainties where data is missing due to tool issues.
- Key themes by day: Highlight the dominant narratives on each day (e.g., “AI hype support,” “rate fears,” “rotation into quality tech,” “growth vs. value rotation,” etc.), along with any obvious sentiment bottlenecks or overhangs.
- News and events: Summary of relevant news items tied to tech sector health, ETF flows, index composition changes, or macro catalysts that would plausibly drive QQQ sentiment (without fabricating specific Reddit threads).
- Trader implications:
  - Short-term risk/volatility levers (ETF-level sentiment, sector concentration, macro catalysts).
  - Medium-term directional considerations (flows into/out of tech-heavy ETFs, earnings season tailwinds/headwinds, policy/regulatory risks).
  - Positioning considerations (options activity signals, hedging ideas, rotation themes).
- Fine-grained insights: Concrete, actionable takeaways for traders and investors, with caveats and sensitivity to data gaps.
- Risks and caveats: A clear note on the data limitations due to the tool outage and the ETF-specific nuances (e.g., liquidity in times of tech sector volatility, large-cap tech concentration effects, etc.).
- Markdown table: A concise, readable table at the end organizing key findings, drivers, and implications (to be appended once data is in).

Please tell me:
- Should I retry the Reddit data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with the qualitative report using the plan above and fill in Reddit details as soon as the tool works again?
- If you want the fastest path to a report, I can start with the framework immediately and tag sections that require Reddit specifics as “pending Reddit data” so you can see where that feed would plug in.
