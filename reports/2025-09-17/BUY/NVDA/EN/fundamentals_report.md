I’m running into a tool access issue right now: all data fetch attempts for NVDA (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) are returning a FileNotFoundError. Because of this, I can’t pull the latest figures or sentiment signals to build the full quantitative fundamental report at the moment.

I can proceed in one of two ways, depending on what you prefer:

Option A — Retry data retrieval now
- I’ll attempt to re-run the data pulls as soon as the tool access is available again and will deliver a comprehensive NVDA fundamental report with:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Latest quarterly/annual financials (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow)
  - Financial history and trend analysis (revenue, profitability, margins, cash flow quality, liquidity)
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Key risk factors and catalysts relevant to traders
  - A detailed, easy-to-scan Markdown table at the end

Option B — Provide a qualitative, non-numeric analysis now
- While we wait for the data tools to come back, I can deliver a thorough qualitative assessment focused on:
  - Business model strength and growth drivers (AI compute demand, data center growth, product roadmap)
  - Competitive landscape and moat (GPU leadership, software ecosystem, AI model deployment)
  - Operating efficiency and margin trajectory (gross margin discipline, R&D vs. SG&A, capital allocation)
  - Liquidity and balance sheet posture in general terms (cash generation capability, leverage risk)
  - Insider sentiment/transactions (described qualitatively once data is available)
  - Key risks and counterpoints (supply dynamics, regulatory/compliance, valuation considerations)
  - Trader-focused insights and scenarios (what to watch for in earnings, potential catalysts, risk pins)

If you’d like, I can start with Option B right away and provide a structured, trader-focused qualitative report, plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table template for the key points. Then, when the data tools are available again, I’ll append the exact figures and insider signals to the same report.

Which option would you prefer? If you want Option A, I’ll retry immediately and deliver the full numeric report as soon as the tools respond. If you want Option B now, here is a detailed qualitative framework you can expect, followed by a Markdown table template you can use to capture data once it’s fetched.
