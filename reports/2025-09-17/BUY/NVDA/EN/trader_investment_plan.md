Assessment:
- The provided plan solidly asserts Nvidia’s secular AI compute demand, software moat (CUDA ecosystem), and multi-year revenue visibility. The main risks cited (valuation, concentration in megadeals, China/regulatory headlines, supply-chain dynamics) are real but manageable with a disciplined risk framework and hedging. Taken together, the risk-reward remains favorable for a long exposure, especially with staged entry and risk controls.

Recommendation (actionable and disciplined):
- Primary stance: Buy NVDA, using a staged entry and robust risk management to navigate near-term volatility and macro/regulatory headlines.

Execution blueprint:
1) Position sizing and entry
- Target exposure: 2% of portfolio as a base long NVDA position.
- Staged entry (if not already long):
  - Tranche 1: Initiate with ~1/3 of the planned position on a pullback or neutral session.
  - Tranche 2: Add on a 5–10% pullback or after a constructive guide/earnings update confirming durable demand.
  - Tranche 3: Complete the position if the name reclaims a higher range with continued infra demand signals.

2) Stop and risk controls
- Stop-loss: Hard stop ~12–15% below average entry price.
- Trailing mechanism: Implement an 8–12% trailing stop from the highest price since entry.

3) Hedging to manage key risks
- Protective puts: Buy 3–6 month OTM puts (5–10% OTM) to cap downside around macro/regulatory events.
- Collar alternative: Long NVDA stock + long put + short call above your target to cap downside while allowing upside within a defined range.
- Earnings hedges: Consider a modest defined-risk option setup ahead of earnings (e.g., iron condor or short-duration put spread) to manage volatility.

4) Catalysts and earnings approach
- Catalysts: Momentum in large infra deals, broader AI workload adoption, and diversified regional demand; monitor CoreWeave-type momentum and non-China demand signals.
- Earnings stance: Avoid oversized post-earnings bets. If results align or exceed guidance, scale into the position; if guidance disappoints, rely on hedges and be prepared to trim or exit.

5) Monitoring and risk adjustment
- Weekly reviews: Demand signals, backlog progression, utilization trends, and regulatory headlines.
- Rebalancing triggers: If regulatory headwinds intensify, megadeal cadence slows meaningfully, or multiple expansions compress, tighten hedges or trim exposure accordingly.

6) Lessons applied
- Don’t rely on a single signal; confirm with backlog, regional demand breadth, and software moat strength.
- Treat regulatory headlines as a separate risk vector; size hedges accordingly.
- Separate near-term noise from long-term trajectory; maintain discipline with staged entries and defined risk controls.

Execution-ready notes
- If you’re already long, add a modest hedging layer (protective puts or a collar) to manage catalysts while preserving core exposure.
- If you’re not yet long, implement a staged entry with explicit stop levels and hedges in place to control downside risk.

Bottom line:
- Buy with a disciplined risk framework and hedging to balance macro/regulatory exposure and megadeal concentration risk. The long-run AI compute growth story, moat, and multi-year demand signals justify participation, provided you follow the staged-entry approach and protections outlined above.
