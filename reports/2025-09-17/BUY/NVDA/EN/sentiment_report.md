I ran into an internal error fetching Reddit stock info for NVDA (FileNotFoundError). It looks like the tool is temporarily unavailable or misconfigured on this end. I can retry immediately, or we can proceed with a broader qualitative analysis using other sources and then pull Reddit data as soon as the tool is back. Which would you prefer?

If you’d like me to proceed now without the Reddit tool, here’s how I’ll approach NVDA sentiment and news for the past week, and what you’ll get in the final report.

What I’ll gather (alternative sources)
- Social media sentiment: X/Twitter, stock-focused forums (StockTwits), and other relevant Reddit threads outside the direct Reddit-NVDA feed if available through other tools or manual checks.
- Public sentiment signals: daily sentiment scores, volume of posts, notable spikes around key events (e.g., earnings, product launches, AI compute demand news, supply chain rumors).
- News and headlines: recent company news, analyst notes, supply/demand trends for AI GPUs, data center demand, manufacturing updates, regulatory or geopolitical factors that could impact NVDA.
- Thematic analysis: recurring topics (AI compute demand, AI model training breakthroughs, pricing/availability of H100/next-gen GPUs, channel inventory, competitor moves, AI cloud demand, AI software ecosystem momentum).

What I’ll deliver (structure)
- Executive snapshot: overall sentiment trend over the past 7 days, key catalysts, and any immediate risk/arrow for momentum.
- Day-by-day sentiment dashboard: a concise table with date, source mix, sentiment score, notable topics, and implied trader takeaway.
- Thematic deep-dive: 2–3 core themes driving sentiment this week (e.g., AI compute demand, supply constraints, consumer/gaming demand), with evidence from posts and headlines.
- News impact analysis: how the latest news items could influence near-term price action (1–2 day and 1–2 week horizons).
- Risk factors: potential headwinds or catalysts that could swing sentiment.
- Trader-oriented implications: actionable takeaways for momentum, mean-reversion, and risk management (e.g., Identify if sentiment is overextended, proximity to key support/resistance levels in NVDA stock behavior, if applicable).
- Makrdown table: a structured summary at the end with key points (see template below).

Template Makrdown table (to be included in final report)
- Date
- Source (Reddit / X / News / Other)
- Sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative, with a numeric score if available)
- Key Topic / Theme
- Headline / Snippet
- Implication for Traders

Example row (illustrative, will be filled with actual data once sourced)
- 2025-09-17 | Reddit | Positive (0.72) | AI compute demand strength | "NVDA GPUs in data center orders exceed forecast" | Short-term bullish tilt; watch for breakout near resistance at $X

Next steps
- Please tell me if you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the broad qualitative analysis using other sources only. If you prefer a retry, I’ll attempt the Reddit pull again immediately and then integrate those results into the report.
- If you want, I can also draft the full final report with the Makrmarkdown table layout (as shown) so you’re ready to review as soon as Reddit data comes back.
