Sorry about that — I tried to fetch Reddit stock data for AAPL on 2025-09-17, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I’m unable to pull the Reddit feed right now.

Options to proceed:
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available again (or you can prompt me to try again later).
- Option B: I proceed with a high-quality, qualitative analysis using other public sources (news headlines, public sentiment signals, and known recent events) for AAPL over the past week, while clearly noting the data gap from Reddit.

If you’re okay with Option B now, I’ll deliver a comprehensive long-form report including:
- Day-by-day sentiment snapshot (qualitative, with themes and notable outliers)
- Key recent news catalysts (product launches, earnings, regulatory, supply chain, services growth)
- Thematic drivers (hardware vs. services mix, guidance, margins, AI/AR initiatives, China exposure)
- Trader-focused insights (risk factors, potential catalysts, and scenario implications)
- A Makrdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference

Please confirm whether you’d like me to proceed with Option B, or tell me to retry the Reddit data fetch when the tool becomes available.
