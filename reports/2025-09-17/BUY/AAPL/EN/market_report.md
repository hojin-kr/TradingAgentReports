Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AAPL data and run the indicator checks, but the data-access tools are currently returning a FileNotFoundError on this end. I can retry shortly or proceed with a plan you can implement once data is available. In the meantime, here’s a concise, well-rounded indicator plan tailored for AAPL, using 8 complementary indicators (no redundancy) and a rationale you can apply once the data feed is healthy.

Selected indicators (8)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll

Why these 8 are suitable now
- Moving Averages (close_10_ema, close_50_sma, close_200_sma)
  - close_10_ema provides a fast read on near-term momentum and potential entry/exit shifts.
  - close_50_sma offers a medium-term trend view and dynamic support/resistance; helps filter noise from the 10-EMA.
  - close_200_sma anchors the long-term trend; crossovers with shorter averages (e.g., golden/death cross concepts) are powerful filters for strategic stance.
  - Using all three helps you gauge trend direction across multiple horizons and reduces reliance on a single lagging signal.
- MACD Group (macd, macds, macdh)
  - macd captures momentum shifts via the difference of EMAs; macds (signal line) smooths this into actionable crossovers; macdh (histogram) shows momentum strength and potential divergences.
  - Together, these three give a coherent view of momentum, its acceleration/deceleration, and potential trend changes, with crossovers corroborated by histogram dynamics.
- RSI (rsi)
  - RSI provides a momentum-only view of overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. It’s a good complement to trend indicators to spot divergences especially when price is near multi-timeframe support/resistance.
- Boll (boll)
  - Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) serves as a dynamic normalization line; Bollinger Bands help identify breakout zones and mean-reversion tendencies, particularly useful in range-bound vs. breakout contexts.
  - This adds a volatility-structural layer to the trend/momentum framework without duplicating RSI or MACD signals.

How to interpret signals with these indicators (general guidance)
- Trend alignment: Look for concordance across the three moving averages (e.g., 10-EMA above 50-SMA above 200-SMA for bullish bias; the reverse for bearish bias). Use this as the baseline direction.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD positive cross above the signal line with rising histogram supports a momentum-driven move in the same direction as the trend. Negative MACD cross with a negative histogram supports a down-move.
- Momentum strength and divergence: RSI trending toward overbought/oversold levels can inform timing, especially if price is near key support/resistance; any RSI divergence with price can flag potential reversals even if trend indicators are favorable.
- Volatility and breakout context: Boll middle line helps you assess where price is relative to a mean; expanding bands typically precede or accompany breakouts; price touching or riding the upper band can indicate strong upside momentum in a bullish trend, while touching the lower band points to downside momentum in a bearish setup.

Operational notes
- Use multi-indicator confirmation: Avoid acting on a single indicator. Require confirmation across at least 2–3 of the indicators (e.g., price above 50-SMA with MACD bullish crossover and RSI not in extreme overbought zone).
- Timeframe considerations: For spot entries, prefer aligning signals on a higher-resolution chart (e.g., 1D or 4H) with a confirmation on a lower-resolution chart (e.g., 1W) to avoid whipsaws in choppy markets.
- Risk management: While ATR is a useful companion for setting stops and sizing, it’s not in the current 8-indicator set. When data is available, consider adding ATR to quantify current volatility for stop placement.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval as soon as the data service comes back online, or you can authorize me to attempt again now.
- If you want, I can adapt the indicator set (e.g., replace or add ATR or VWMA) depending on the market regime once data is accessible.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use / Signals |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; quick shifts | Use with trend filters: uptrend when 10-EMA above 50-SMA; look for crossovers as near-term entries |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Confirms trend direction from 10-EMA; acts as a mid-term discipline and pullback level |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; broad market context | Golden/death cross signals long-term shifts; confirms strategic bias |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMAs; direction and speed | Bullish cross above zero with rising histogram supports long entries; bearish cross supports shorts |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothed momentum signal | Cross of MACD with MACD Signal strengthens entry/exit timing |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Rising histogram supports momentum; negative or diverging histogram warns of fading momentum |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold conditions | RSI near extremes can precede reversals; watch for divergences with price |
| boll | Volatility | Bollinger Middle as baseline; breakout vs mean-reversion context | Price near/above upper band in uptrends suggests strength; near lower band in downtrends suggests weakness or reversal potential |

If you’d like, I can try the data fetch again now or on a schedule you specify. Just tell me how you’d like to proceed.
