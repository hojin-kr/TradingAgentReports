Apologies — I’m running into an environment error pulling the data right now. All data-retrieval tools returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the latest balance sheet/income statement/cash flow for AAPL at the moment.

Here’s how we can proceed:

Options
- Retry now: If you’d like, I can attempt the data pull again immediately and report back with the full fundamentals once the tools are accessible.
- Manual/alternative approach: I can provide a comprehensive fundamental framework for AAPL using publicly available knowledge up to 2024–2025, clearly labeling any data as qualitative unless you approve using external sources you provide. This would cover company profile, business model, key revenue drivers, margin profile, liquidity, capital allocation, and governance signals (including insider sentiment/transactions if you have separate data).

What I will deliver once data access works (or if you provide data)
- Company profile and business model
- Recent financial snapshot (latest quarterly/quad data you want) including:
  - Income statement highlights (revenue by segment, gross margin, operating margin, net income)
  - Balance sheet snapshot (assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity metrics)
  - Cash flow highlights (operating, investing, financing activities; free cash flow)
- Historical financial trends (last 4–8 quarters/years) with drill-downs on drivers (iPhone/Services/Wearables, etc.)
- Profitability and efficiency metrics (gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROE, ROIC, asset turnover)
- Liquidity and leverage (current ratio, quick ratio, net debt/EBITDA if applicable)
- Capital allocation and shareholder returns (buybacks, dividends, debt issuance)
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days or as available)
- Key risks and catalysts (competitive dynamics, supply chain, regulatory, product cycle timing)
- Trader-focused takeaways (quality of the earnings mix, revenue diversification, resilience to macro shifts)
- A compact Markdown table at the end organizing key points (sections, data status, and actionable notes)

 REQUEST: How would you like to proceed?
- Tell me to retry the data pulls now, and I’ll run them and return a full, data-backed report.
- Or provide a preferred data source or allow me to use a manual/qualitative approach and I’ll prepare the comprehensive report with clear caveats.

If you want me to proceed with a qualitative, data-light report right away (no tool pulls), I can start outlining now and flag where numbers would be inserted once data access is restored.
