I attempted to fetch PLTR data and run the selected indicators, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError across the board. This looks like a temporary data-access issue. I can retry now, or adjust the date range, or switch indicators if you’d like. In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan using 8 complementary indicators (no redundancy) and why they’re suitable for Palantir (PLTR) in this context.

Selected indicators (up to 8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale for each indicator
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify whether PLTR is in an intermediate uptrend or downtrend and can provide confirmation when price tests this level.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for assessing structural trend (bullish if price trades above; bearish if below) and for evaluating the risk of major trend reversals (e.g., golden/death cross implications when crossovers occur with other signals).
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum and potential quick entry/exit hints. More responsive than the 50/200 SMAs, helpful to flag near-term shifts in sentiment, especially around earnings or catalysts.
- macd: Core momentum signal—the MACD line relative to its signal line helps identify trend changes and momentum strength. Works well when paired with trend clarity from SMAs.
- macds: MACD signal line. Crossovers with the MACD line often provide more actionable confirmation signals, reducing false positives in choppiness.
- rsi: Momentum gauge and overbought/oversold context. Useful for spotting potential reversals when price action aligns with trend signals, and for divergence observations in a trending market.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA). Acts as a dynamic baseline and can help identify mean-reversion tendencies relative to price action. Pairs well with band signals (upper/lower bands) for breakout/reversion context.
- atr: Volatility metric for risk management. Helps size positions and set stop levels; rising ATR implies higher volatility and potentially wider stops, while shrinking ATR suggests tighter risk controls.

Nuanced, practical interpretation framework (without exact numbers due to data retrieval issue)
- Trend assessment: Compare price relative to 50 SMA and 200 SMA.
  - If PLTR stays above both and 50 SMA is above 200 SMA, the longer-term and intermediate trend is bullish. Look for pullbacks toward the 50 or 200 SMAs to hold as potential buys, with MACD confirming momentum.
  - If price sits below both SMAs or if the 50 SMA crosses below the 200 SMA, be wary of a developing downtrend and look for confirmation from MACD and RSI (e.g., MACD negative momentum and RSI trending lower).
- Short-term momentum signals: Use 10 EMA and MACD family signals to time entries.
  - A bullish tilt is reinforced when price trades above the 10 EMA and MACD crosses above its signal line, ideally with MACD above zero or rising.
  - A bearish tilt is suggested when price crosses below the 10 EMA and MACD crosses below its signal line, with MACD trending downward.
- Momentum and reversals: RSI helps flag potential turning points in context.
  - In a rising trend, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; look for RSI divergence or prudent levels near 70 as a caution rather than a pure sell signal.
  - In a downtrend, RSI near or below 30 can confirm oversold conditions but should be confirmed with price/volume signals to avoid early shorts in a potentially reversing market.
- Volatility and risk controls: ATR informs position sizing and stop placement.
  - A rising ATR warrants wider stops to avoid being knocked out by normal volatility; consider adjusting risk per trade accordingly.
  - A contracting ATR might permit tighter stops and tighter risk management as price action becomes less volatile.
- Volatility-based mean reversion vs breakouts: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) provides the benchmark for assessing deviations.
  - If price rides the upper Bollinger Band with rising momentum (confirmed by MACD), consider possible continuation in a bullish breakout scenario, especially if RSI remains supportive and price holds above the 50/200 SMAs.
  - If price touches/uses the lower Bollinger Band and RSI shows oversold tendencies, it could signal a near-term pullback with potential mean reversion, particularly if MACD remains above zero or shows stabilizing momentum.
- Catalyst-aware framing: With earnings or strategic news frequently driving PLTR, align entries with the above indicators to avoid false signals in earnings weeks.
  - Prioritize signals where multiple indicators align (trend from SMAs, momentum from MACD, RSI confirming momentum, and volatility context from ATR).

What to watch (practical scenarios)
- Bullish setup when:
  - Price above 50 and 200 SMA, 50 SMA above 200 SMA
  - MACD line above its signal line and rising
  - RSI holding above 50 without extreme overbought conditions
  - Price testing or riding above Bollinger Middle with potential to move toward upper band
  - ATR showing stable-to-increasing volatility (supporting momentum breakout contexts)
- Bearish setup when:
  - Price below 50 and 200 SMA, with 50 SMA below 200 SMA
  - MACD line below its signal line and falling
  - RSI failing to sustain above 50 or showing negative divergence
  - Price near/below Bollinger Middle and approaching lower band
  - ATR rising on downside moves indicating stronger volatility in the bear leg
- Neutral/unclear setup:
  - Price around SMAs with mixed MACD/MACDs signals and RSI around mid-range; wait for clearer alignment of momentum and volatility.

Data retrieval note
- I’m ready to retry fetching PLTR data and the indicators as soon as the data service is available. If you’d like, I can retry now, or I can adjust the date range (e.g., last 6–12 months or last 60–90 trading days) or switch to a different set of indicators.

Appendix: concise Markdown table of key points

  - Trade implication: Bullish if price above; bearish if below
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - Signals: Short-term momentum
