Sorry about the hiccup. The Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError when I tried to fetch PLTR data for 2025-09-17. I can retry shortly or pivot to alternative data sources, but I don’t want to spin up data I can’t verify.

Here are two options:
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then compile the full report once I have that data.
- Option B: I proceed with a comprehensive, trader-focused framework now (without the Reddit data yet), and I’ll fill in the Reddit-specific insights as soon as the tool works.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option B immediately and then switch to Option A as soon as the tool is available.

In the meantime, here is a structured plan and a framework for the long report I will produce once data is in:

What I will cover (weekly window: 2025-09-10 to 2025-09-17)
- Sentiment synthesis
  - Daily sentiment scores from social media (Reddit, X/Twitter, StockTwits) and any public forums
  - Topic modeling highlights: common themes (AI/news, government contracts, Foundry adoption, product updates)
  - Engagement signals: volume spikes, unique posters, and potential coordinated campaigns
- News and catalysts
  - Key headlines (product updates, partnerships, government/commercial deals, regulatory or policy notes)
  - Earnings/guidance color if any, and commentary tone
  - Contextual market factors impacting PLTR (tech stock sector trends, AI adoption chatter, etc.)
- Price/sentiment correlation and drivers
  - Short-term momentum vs sentiment (7-day and intraday tendencies)
  - Notable divergences (positive sentiment with flat/negative price action or vice versa)
  - Options activity signals if available (put/call skew, IV changes)
- Risk and scenario analysis
  - Most likely near-term catalysts and risks (contracts, licensing changes, competitive landscape)
  - Possible surprises and how sentiment could react
- Trader implications and actionable takeaways
  - Short-term is this week: potential entry/exit zones, risk controls, and hedging ideas
  - Medium-term read: trends to watch over the next 2–4 weeks
- Data gaps and caveats
  - Limitations of social sentiment data; potential bias; data freshness
  - How to interpret sentiment vs actual price moves

Proposed structure for the final report (with a Makrdown table at the end)
- Executive snapshot
- Social sentiment overview (daily)
- News timeline and catalysts
- Sentiment vs price analysis (with charts if possible)
- Key drivers by category (product, contracts, partnerships)
- Risk assessment and scenarios
- Trader-focused takeaways
- Appendix: data sources, methodology, and limitations
- Makrdown table: Key points by metric (Sentiment, Headlines, Price, Volatility, Catalysts, Risk)

Makrdown table template (to be filled after data is collected)
- Metric | Last 7 days value | Key drivers | Implications for traders
- Sentiment score |  |  | 
- Positive headlines |  |  | 
- Negative headlines |  |  | 
- Price change window |  |  | 
- Intraday volatility |  |  | 
- Notable catalysts |  |  | 
- Risks to watch |  |  | 

If you want me to proceed with Option A (retry now for Reddit data) I’ll attempt the fetch again and then begin assembling the full report with all sections and the final Makrdown table. Otherwise, I’ll start with Option B and deliver the framework now, then update with Reddit data as soon as the tool comes back online. Which would you prefer?
