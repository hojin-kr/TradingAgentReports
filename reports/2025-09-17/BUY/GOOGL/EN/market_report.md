Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Yahoo Finance data for GOOGL but ran into a backend FileNotFoundError in the data tool. It looks like a temporary issue with the data fetch layer rather than something with the symbol itself. I don’t want to proceed with assumptions about price data, so I’ll pause on generating the full trend report until the data is retrievable.

Proposed next steps (please tell me which you prefer):
- Retry data fetch now for GOOGL (same date range: 2024-09-17 to 2025-09-17).
- Try an alternate ticker variant to avoid any symbol-specific data gaps:
  - GOOG (Class C) or GOOGL (Class A) if available in the data source.
- Narrow the date range to ensure the data source has enough history (e.g., 2024-12-01 to 2025-09-17) and retry.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a robust indicator setup for when data is retrieved, and then run the full analysis as soon as the data is back.

Recommended 8-indicator lineup (complementary, non-redundant) you can expect me to use once data is available:
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark to confirm the broader directional context (and to watch for golden/death cross cues at longer horizons).
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance layer to corroborate the 200-SMA reading.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum gauge to flag quick shifts and potential entry points, especially when aligned with trend.
- macd: Momentum signal via MACD line crossovers; useful for trend-change timing when supported by other filters.
- macds: MACD Signal line; helps confirm MACD-derived signals and reduces false entries when lines cross.
- rsi: Momentum strength and potential reversal cues via overbought/oversold levels; good complement to trend indicators to spot divergences.
- atr: Volatility-based risk management anchor; use to adjust stop placement and position sizing according to current volatility.
- vwma: Volume-supported trend confirmation; helps validate price action with volume flow, reducing reliance on price alone in choppy markets.

Why this set is suitable for GOOGL in a typical large-cap tech context:
- Combines both trend (200/50 SMA) and momentum (10-EMA, MACD family, RSI) to capture directional bias and timing signals.
- Includes volatility (ATR) to manage risk and adapt stops as volatility expands or contracts.
- Adds a volume-backed perspective (VWMA) to distinguish price-driven moves from price-volume anomalies, which is especially useful in names with event-driven moves (earnings, AI news, regulatory updates).
- Avoids redundancy by not overloading with all MACD components or parallel momentum oscillators that often move in tandem.

What I’ll deliver once data is retrieved:
- A detailed, nuanced report of the observed trends, including:
  - The alignment (or misalignment) between short-, medium-, and long-term indicators.
  - Key support/resistance levels implied by SMA lines and price proximity to VWMA.
  - MACD and RSI signals with crossovers/divergences and their timing relative to price action.
  - ATR-based risk management notes and recommended stop adjustment bands.
  - A concise verdict on likely short- to medium-term bias with caveats and scenarios.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the core points, signals, and actionable takeaways.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
1) Retry fetching data for GOOGL now (same dates).
2) Try GOOG/GOOGL instead.
3) Change the date range (e.g., shorter window or different start date).
4) Proceed with the indicator framework as a placeholder plan while I fetch data.

Your call, and I’ll take it from there.
