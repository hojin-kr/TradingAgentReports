Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the Reddit stock news for GOOGL (GOOGL) for 2025-09-17, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError repeatedly. It looks like the data extraction service is currently unavailable or misconfigured on my end. I can’t pull the latest social sentiment data from Reddit right now.

What I can do now
- I can outline a comprehensive, data-informed analysis plan you’ll want once the Reddit data tool is back up.
- I can provide a high-quality, structured framework for the long report and placeholders you can fill in with the actual data later.
- I can still deliver a robust, trader-focused interpretation by focusing on sources I can reliably discuss (e.g., general sentiment themes seen in AI/tech conversations, high-level news impact) while clearly labeling as placeholders until Reddit data is available.

Recommended plan to proceed once the tool is back
1) Data collection (7-14 days window)
   - Reddit: daily sentiment scores for GOOGL, top threads by engagement, macro themes (AI dominance, ad market, cloud growth, regulatory risk, hardware/YouTube).
   - Additional social sources (if possible): X/Twitter sentiment, StockTwits, news mention frequency, notable influencer opinions.
   - Company news: Google/Alphabet press releases, earnings calls, product announcements, regulatory updates, antitrust proceedings.

2) Sentiment analysis
   - Compute daily sentiment polarity (positive/neutral/negative) and intensity.
   - Identify dominant themes per day (e.g., AI updates, earnings expectations, policy/regulatory noise, cloud milestones).
   - Track sentiment volatility (rolling 3-5 day windows) to surface potential regime shifts.

3) News and event synthesis
   - Map headlines to potential price impact (earnings, guidance changes, AI product news, regulatory actions).
   - Annotate catalysts for the near term (earnings date, AI events, regulatory rulings).

4) Implications for traders
   - Short-term: sentiment-driven moves around key dates; potential risk of sentiment reversals.
   - Medium-term: product and cloud growth cadence; competitive dynamics with peers; AI-related monetization expectations.
   - Risk factors: regulatory pressure, antitrust concerns, macro ad-market softness, AI platform competition.

5) Output structure
   - Executive snapshot: current sentiment posture, key catalysts, and risk/reward skew.
   - Daily sentiment narrative: day-by-day breakdown with top themes and notable threads.
   - Theme deep-dives: AI/Cloud/Ad business, regulatory risk, YouTube monetization, capital allocation.
   - Quantitative signals: sentiment scores, volatility, news count, and potential price implications.
   - Trader-oriented implications: actionable takeaways, watchlist prompts, risk checks.

Proposed report outline (ready to populate once data is available)

Next steps
- If you’d like me to proceed with the full, data-backed long report, I’ll retry the Reddit data tool as soon as it’s available and then generate the detailed analysis with the daily sentiment breakdown, top threads, and news highlights, followed by trader-focused implications and the final Markdown table.
- Alternatively, I can draft the complete, evidence-backed report structure and fill in the qualitative sections with conservative, general-market context (clearly labeled as placeholder sections) until the Reddit data retrieval is restored.

Would you prefer:
A) I retry and generate the full data-driven report as soon as the Reddit tool works, or
B) I proceed with a fully structured qualitative draft (no Reddit data yet) that you can review and fill in later?
