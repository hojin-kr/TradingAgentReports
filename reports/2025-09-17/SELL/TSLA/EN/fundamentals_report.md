I attempted to pull the latest TSLA fundamentals using the available tools, but all attempts failed due to a FileNotFoundError (system/tool issue). Because of this, I don’t have the latest insider sentiment/transactions or the SimFin financial statements to include in the report right now.

What this means and next steps:
- I cannot currently provide the detailed, data-backed insights you want (insider sentiment, insider transactions, quarterly balance sheet/income statement/cash flow) without the tools returning data.
- I can proceed in one of two ways:
  1) Retry and fix the tool calls now to fetch TSLA data, then generate a complete, detailed fundamental report with insider data and financial statements.
  2) If you’d prefer, I can deliver a thorough qualitative framework and a ready-to-fill template report based on TSLA fundamentals (without live data), plus a Markdown table skeleton you can populate with actual numbers later.

If you want me to retry, I’ll proceed with the same data sources (Finnhub insider sentiment/transactions and SimFin balance sheet/income statement/cash flow) as soon as the internal tooling is available again. If you’d rather, I can also switch to a safe, non-tool-based analysis using public knowledge up to my last update, clearly labeled as non-tool data.

Proposed report structure (once data is available)
- Summary snapshot
  - Ticker: TSLA
  - Current quarter/year and trailing periods
  - High-level takeaways for traders (growth momentum, profitability, balance sheet liquidity)

- Company profile
  - Business model, segments, key products (vehicles, energy, services)
  - Geographic exposure and market position
  - Regulatory/compliance notes and macro risk factors (regulatory, supply chain, competitive landscape)

- Financial highlights (most recent period, plus history)
  - Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income
  - Margins (gross, operating, net)
  - EBITDA/adjusted metrics (if used by the company)
  - Cash flow: operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow
  - Key balance sheet items: cash, debt, equity, goodwill/intangible assets, inventory, receivables/payables

- Income statement analysis
  - Revenue growth trend and drivers (volume, price/mix, product mix)
  - Expense structure (COGS, R&D, SG&A) and margin dynamics
  - Non-recurring items and unusual costs

- Balance sheet analysis
  - Liquidity (current ratio, quick ratio) and solvency (debt/EBITDA, debt/equity)
  - Asset quality (inventory turnover, receivables days)
  - Leverage and capital structure changes

- Cash flow analysis
  - Cash from operating activities and working capital changes
  - Capital expenditures and free cash flow
  - Financing activities and debt movements

- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Sentiment tilt and notable insider moves
  - Purchases vs. sales, potential implications for ownership confidence

- Historical context and trend analysis
  - 4–8 quarter historical view of revenue/profitability
  - Any acceleration or deceleration in growth
  - Payback or return profile on investments

- Risk and catalysts
  - Near-term catalysts (product launches, production ramps, capacity expansions)
  - Key risks (competition, supply chain, regulation, demand headwinds)

- Trading takeaways
  - If growth remains durable, which issues (margin, FCF, capex intensity) are the primary drivers
  - Potential mispricings or data gaps the market may be overlooking
  - Short-term vs. long-term considerations

Appendix: Markdown table (ready to fill with actual data)
- I will append a summarized table like the following once data is loaded:
- Metrics: Revenue, Net Income, EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Net Margin, ROE, ROA, Current Ratio, Debt/Equity
- Insider sentiment score (15-day window)
- Notable insider transactions (count and net amount)
- Key balance sheet items (Cash, Debt, Total Assets)
- Key cash flow items (OCF, Capex, FCF)
- Historical trend (YoY or QoQ changes)

If you want me to proceed now with the qualitative framework and the table skeleton, please say “Proceed with a framework-only report.” If you’d prefer I retry the data pulls, I’ll attempt again and then generate the full, data-backed report as soon as the tools respond.

Would you like me to retry the data fetches now, or should I provide the framework and a ready-to-fill table first?
