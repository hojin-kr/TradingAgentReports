Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch TSLA Reddit stock news for 2025-09-17, but the tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError) twice. It looks like the Reddit data fetch utility is currently unavailable on my end.

Options to move forward:
- Option 1: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (or as soon as the tool is available) and then deliver the full long-form report with Reddit-derived sentiment included.
- Option 2: I proceed with a comprehensive TSLA analysis now using other accessible sources (public news, general social sentiment from available channels, and measurable fundamentals) and I’ll clearly note that Reddit data is unavailable until the tool is restored. I’ll Still deliver a detailed, trader-focused report and append a Markdown table at the end.

If you’d like, I can start with Option 2 right away. Here’s what I’ll cover in the TSLA long report (excluding Reddit data for now, but with a plan to incorporate it once the tool is back):

- Executive snapshot
  - Brief view of the stock’s recent price action, key catalysts, and inferred sentiment drivers from latest headlines.
  - Notable risks and upside catalysts to watch in the coming week.

- Recent news landscape (last 7 days)
  - Summary of major company announcements, product updates (e.g., FSD, vehicle cadence, energy storage), production updates, pricing actions, regulatory developments, and supplier/newsflow.
  - How these headlines typically impact sentiment and positioning (retail vs. institutional).

- Public sentiment signals (excluding Reddit)
  - What headlines and media tone are implying about demand, margins, and execution.
  - Social chatter indicators gathered from other accessible sources (e.g., major news outlets, corporate communications, investor forums that aren’t Reddit, and general social sentiment platforms you approve).

- Key drivers and qualitative read-through
  - Demand environment (US/China/Europe), price strategy, and competitive dynamics vs. peers (BYD, NIO, Rivian, Lucid).
  - Margin dynamics (gross margin, operating leverage from scale, factory utilization).
  - Execution risk (CAPEX, supply chain, FSD timeline, regulatory scrutiny).

- Quantitative framing for traders
  - Support/resistance levels to watch this week, potential breakout zones, and risk management angles (positioning signals, stop levels, volatility considerations).
  - Event calendar hooks (earnings cadence, product updates, regulatory decisions) that could trigger move.

- Summary of implications for trading decisions
  - If the tone tilts bullish on demand/profitability, potential upside thesis with triggers.
  - If the tone softens on margins or regulatory/supply concerns, potential downside risks and hedging angles.

- Markdown table (key points)
  - I’ll append a concise table at the end detailing: catalysts, sentiment tilt, headline risk, key data points, and potential trade implications.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Proceed with Option 1 (retry Reddit data now, then deliver the full report with Reddit insights).
- Proceed with Option 2 (non-Reddit-focused report now, with Reddit data to be added once the tool is fixed).

If you want Option 2 to start immediately, I’ll begin assembling the full TSLA report as outlined above and deliver it in a structured long-form format with the Markdown table at the end.
