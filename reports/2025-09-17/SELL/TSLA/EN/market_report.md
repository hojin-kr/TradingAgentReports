Sorry about that — the data retrieval step failed due to a FileNotFoundError from the get_YFin_data tool. I attempted to fetch TSLA data for 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-17, but the backend couldn’t locate the required file. I can retry the fetch (with the same range or a revised range) or proceed with an indicator-focused plan using the best-available approach. Please tell me if you’d like me to retry now or adjust the date window.

In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that will give TSLA a well-rounded, complementary view (trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context) once the data is loaded:

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Trend (Medium-Term)
  - Why it’s useful: Helps identify the mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; useful for filtering entries in conjunction with faster signals.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Trend (Long-Term)
  - Why it’s useful: Establishes the long-term trend baseline; helps identify potential golden/death cross setups and overall regime.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Momentum (Short-Term)
  - Why it’s useful: Captures quick shifts in momentum; helps flag rapid entries or exits in choppier markets when used with longer-term averages.
- macd
  - Category: Momentum
  - Why it’s useful: MACD crossovers signal potential trend changes; good for spotting momentum shifts in conjunction with price action.
- macds
  - Category: Momentum
  - Why it’s useful: MACD Signal line crossovers provide a clearer trigger to combine with MACD for entries/exits and to confirm MACD-based signals.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum
  - Why it’s useful: Gauges overbought/oversold conditions and can reveal divergences; useful for timing reversals in context of trend.
- boll
  - Category: Volatility
  - Why it’s useful: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) sets a dynamic baseline; when paired with band context, it helps spot breakouts or mean-reversion opportunities.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility
  - Why it’s useful: Measures true range volatility; helps with risk management (position sizing, stop placement) and understanding current volatility regimes.

Why these are complementary
- The 50/200 SMAs establish multi-timeframe trend context, while the 10 EMA provides a quicker read on momentum shifts.
- MACD and MACD Signal (macd and macds) give corroborating momentum signals to pair with price action and MA crossovers.
- RSI adds a momentum-derivative perspective on overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals, complementing trend signals.
- Bollinger Middle and ATR give volatility context: Boll’s baseline helps with breakout vs. mean-reversion interpretation, while ATR informs risk controls and position sizing under varying volatility.
- VWMA is not included here to keep the set to 8; if you’d prefer more volume context, we can swap in vwma in place of one of the volatility indicators.

Next steps
- I’ll reattempt the data fetch for TSLA (same date range or a shorter window if you prefer) and then run the chosen indicators.
- After data is loaded, I’ll produce a detailed, nuanced trend report that analyzes:
  - The alignment (or misalignment) of MA levels (50 vs 200) and any crossovers.
  - MACD/macd/macds signals and their timing relative to price action.
  - RSI readings in the context of the prevailing trend and any divergences.
  - Volatility regime via Boll boll and ATR, including potential implications for stop placement and risk management.
  - Any volume-confirmation signals via VWMA (if you want me to add it), or use the current indicators to infer volume-driven moves.

Would you like me to retry fetching TSLA data now with the same date window (2025-01-01 to 2025-09-17), or would you prefer a shorter window (e.g., last 12 months) to increase the chance of a successful data load?

Appendix: Key indicators table (to be populated with actual observations once data is loaded)
| Indicator | Category | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Trend (Medium-Term) | Identifies direction and dynamic support/resistance. |
| close_200_sma | Trend (Long-Term) | Confirms overall trend; looks for golden/death cross potential. |
| close_10_ema | Momentum (Short-Term) | Captures quick momentum shifts; timely entry/exit signals. |
| macd | Momentum | Momentum changes and potential trend shifts via crossovers. |
| macds | Momentum | Signals confirmation with MACD line crossovers. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold cues and divergences for reversals. |
| boll | Volatility | Baseline for price relative to volatility; helps spot breakouts/compressions. |
| atr | Volatility | Volatility magnitude for risk management and position sizing. |

Current date reference: 2025-09-17. Once I can fetch the data, I’ll deliver a full, detailed TSLA analysis with your chosen indicators and a final, structured report.
