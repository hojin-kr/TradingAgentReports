Decision: SELL TSLA (reduce exposure now)

Rationale aligned with the provided plan
- Near-term risk remains outsized relative to the potential near-term cash return: uncertain FSD monetization, high capex intensity, and possible margin pressure amid rising competition and regulatory headwinds.
- While the bull thesis highlights a durable software/AI moat and long-term upside, those tail risks don’t guarantee near-term cash flow or margin expansion that justify the current multiple in a macro backdrop that could compress multiples for growth names.
- The plan’s emphasis on risk management, hedging, and reallocation to more certain opportunities remains prudent given the data you provided.

Practical, actionable steps (tailored to your framework)
1) Trim and reallocate
- Reduce TSLA exposure by 40-60% of the current position, aiming for a neutral or modestly reduced base (earlier or staged over 2-4 weeks to avoid abrupt downside capture).

2) Hedge the residual position
- Implement protective hedges on the remaining stake:
  - Buy at-the-money or 5-10% out-of-the-money puts with 6-9 month expiry, or
  - Use a collar: long puts slightly OTM financed by short
    calls OTM (to limit cost while preserving some upside).

3) Reallocate proceeds into a diversified EV/energy software framework
- Deploy to a mix of: established EV players with visible near-term margins, battery/energy software with recurring revenue, and diversified tech/AI names with clearer near-term earnings visibility.

4) Define triggers and cadence
- Reassess on quarterly metrics: delivery momentum, Berlin ramp progress, any FSD monetization milestones, and gross margins/free cash flow trajectory as capex normalizes.
- Schedule a formal review quarterly, or sooner if a major catalyst hits.

5) Risk controls and position sizing
- Allocate a fixed risk budget to TSLA relative to total portfolio risk; implement clear stop/exit criteria for hedges if implied volatility or price action moves meaningfully against the bear thesis.

6) Documentation and learning loop
- Maintain a debiasing note: track which data points (delivery trends, margins, regulatory updates, FSD developments) credibly shift risk-reward to the upside or downside. Use learnings to refine re-entry criteria.

Caveats
- A re-entry point could appear if credible data shows durable margin expansion, clear monetization progress for FSD, and a steadier near-term cash flow trajectory. Until then, preserving capital and reducing single-name risk is sensible.
