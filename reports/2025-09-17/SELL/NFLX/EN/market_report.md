I attempted to retrieve NFLX data and the requested indicator reports, but the data-fetch tools returned errors (FileNotFoundError). I can retry if you’d like, but in the meantime I can still lay out a solid, start-to-finish framework using 8 carefully chosen indicators. When the data is accessible, I’ll generate a detailed, data-driven trend report and the final table will reflect the actual values.

Selected indicators (8) and why they fit NFLX in a typical high-volatility, media-driven stock context
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum gauge. Useful for capturing rapid shifts around earnings, product news, or subscriber data releases. Can provide timely entry/exit hints when combined with longer-term trend filters.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction. Helps distinguish trading-friendly pullbacks within an overall uptrend or downtrend and acts as a dynamic support/resistance level.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend confirmation. Critical for identifying major regime shifts (golden cross/death cross) and for filtering shorter-term noise in a volatile name like NFLX.
- macd: Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line crossovers and divergence. Provides an additional check on trend strength in conjunction with price action and moving averages.
- macdh: MACD histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and potential early divergences, helpful in confirming MACD-driven signals or warning of fading momentum.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold context. Works well with trend filters to avoid chasing false reversal signals in strong trends; also useful for spotting positive/negative divergences with price.
- atr: Volatility measure. Helps with risk management (position sizing, stop placement) and interpreting breakouts or sudden price moves in NFLX’s volatile environment.
- vwma: Volume-weighted avg price. Combines price with volume to confirm the conviction behind moves, especially around earnings or major news when volume can spike.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A cohesive narrative describing NFLX’s trend and momentum context using the 8 indicators above.
- Cross-confirmation checks (e.g., price above 200 SMA and 50 SMA with MACD positive and RSI not in extreme overbought territory) to assess bullishness.
- Volatility and risk considerations (ATR-driven stop placement guidance, volume-confirmed moves via VWMA).
- Specific entry/exit guidance aligned with the current market context (while clearly labeling that actual signals depend on the data at the time of generation).

How to interpret signals (framework you can rely on once data is in)
- bullish scenario: price above 200 SMA, price trending above 50 SMA, 10 EMA turning upward, MACD line above zero with positive histogram, RSI in uptrending neutral-to-positive zone (not overbought), ATR rising modestly (increased volatility with conviction), VWMA aligning with price direction (volume supporting move).
- bearish scenario: price below 200 SMA, price under 50 SMA, 10 EMA turning downward, MACD line crossing below zero or MACD histogram turning negative, RSI rolling lower toward oversold but not necessarily extreme, ATR rising with breakdowns, VWMA price action showing weak or diverging volume.
- caution/neutral scenario: price wandering around the moving averages with flat MACD, RSI in mid-range, ATR subdued; look for validation from volume and longer-term trend (200 SMA) before initiating positions.

Next steps
- I can re-run the data fetch now and generate the full, data-driven report with the exact indicator readings and a final Markdown table of key points.
- If you’d prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative interpretation framework now (as above) and fill in the exact values once data retrieval succeeds.

Markdown table: key indicators, what they measure, and how to interpret for NFLX
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  What it measures: Short-term price momentum relative to a fast exponential moving average.
  How to interpret: Upward turn and price crossing above the 10 EMA suggests short-term bullishness; if price tests but fails to hold above 10 EMA in a broader uptrend, it may indicate consolidation or a minor pullback.

- Indicator: close_50_sma
  What it measures: Medium-term trend direction via a 50-period simple moving average.
  How to interpret: Price above 50 SMA indicates bullish medium-term trend; price below implies bearish or neutral conditions. Crosses with 10 EMA can signal shifts in momentum.

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  What it measures: Long-term trend direction via a 200-period simple moving average.
  How to interpret: Price above 200 SMA supports a long-term bullish regime; price below supports a bearish regime. Golden/death cross with 50 SMA (when 50 crosses above/below 200) adds confirmation.

- Indicator: macd
  What it measures: Momentum and potential trend changes via the MACD line and signal dynamics.
  How to interpret: MACD line crossing above zero and rising suggests bullish momentum; crossing below and falling implies bearish momentum. Crossovers with the MACD Signal add signal strength.

- Indicator: macdh
  What it measures: Momentum strength via MACD histogram.
  How to interpret: Increasing positive histogram supports bullish momentum; increasing negative histogram supports bearish momentum. Divergence between histogram and price can signal weakness of the move.

- Indicator: rsi
  What it measures: Price momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  How to interpret: RSI rising toward or above 70+ indicates potential overbought; falling toward or below 30 indicates potential oversold. Look for divergences with price as early reversal signals.

- Indicator: atr
  What it measures: Market volatility (range-based).
  How to interpret: Rising ATR suggests higher volatility; use to adjust stop distances and position sizing. A spike in ATR around a breakout or earnings may indicate stronger follow-through or risk.

- Indicator: vwma
  What it measures: Volume-confirmed price movement via a volume-weighted moving average.
  How to interpret: Price moving with VWMA adds conviction due to accompanying volume; a move that diverges from VWMA could indicate weakening momentum or distribution.

If you want me to proceed with a data-driven run right away, I can retry the data fetch and indicator calculations as soon as the tool is back up. Please let me know if you want me to attempt the fetch again now or proceed with the framework above in the meantime.
