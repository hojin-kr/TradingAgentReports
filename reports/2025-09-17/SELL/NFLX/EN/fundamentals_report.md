I attempted to fetch the requested fundamental data for NFLX, but the data retrieval failed due to an internal file-not-found error in the tooling layer. Specifically, the parallel tool call and the subsequent single-tool call to get insider sentiment both returned FileNotFoundError. Because of this, I don’t have reliable numbers to report yet from the integrated data sources (Finnhub and SimFin). If you’d like, I can retry the data pulls immediately, or switch to a qualitative/structural analysis using only publicly known fundamentals (without the latest 15-day insider data).

What I can do now
- Prepare a comprehensive NFLX fundamentals report structure and fill in sections I can reliably source once the data tools succeed (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement).
- Provide a clear, trader-oriented interpretation framework (what to watch for, what would change the view, and risk flags) even in the absence of the latest tool data.
- Deliver a Markdown-table summary template you can reuse, with placeholders for the key datapoints.

Proposed next step
- I can retry fetching all five data streams now. If you’d like me to proceed, I’ll run:
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment (NFLX, 2025-09-17)
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions (NFLX, 2025-09-17)
  - get_simfin_balance_sheet (NFLX, quarterly, 2025-09-17)
  - get_simfin_cashflow (NFLX, quarterly, 2025-09-17)
  - get_simfin_income_stmt (NFLX, quarterly, 2025-09-17)
- If the tools fail again, I’ll switch to a structured qualitative analysis and clearly note the data gaps.

How I can proceed
- If you want me to retry now, I’ll execute the data calls again and then deliver:
  - A complete NFLX fundamentals report with detailed insights
  - The filled Markdown table with key datapoints and interpretations
- If you prefer, I can provide a qualitative, data-light assessment right away (no latest 15-day insider data) focusing on known long-term fundamentals, but note that some insights will be less precise without the newest insider signals.

Would you like me to retry the data pulls now, or proceed with a qualitative/structure-based report in the meantime?
