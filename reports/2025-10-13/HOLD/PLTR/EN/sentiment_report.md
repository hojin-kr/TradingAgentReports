Thanks for the nudge. I ran into an internal tool error while trying to fetch Reddit stock news for PLTR on 2025-10-13 (FileNotFoundError). I attempted twice, but the data fetch isn’t available right now. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

Options to move forward
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately if you’d like.
- Proceed without live Reddit data: I can deliver a thorough framework and analysis plan for PLTR’s sentiment and news, clearly labeling any data gaps, and provide a structured report template you can fill in once the data tool comes back online.

Given you asked to “Continue,” here is a comprehensive plan and a practical structure for a long-form PLTR sentiment/news analysis you can use right away. It includes what I would analyze, how I’d interpret it, and a ready-to-fill Markdown table for key points.

What I would analyze (over the past week, up to 2025-10-13)
- Social media sentiment
  - Primary source: Reddit discussions on PLTR (r/investing, r/stocks, etc.).
  - Secondary sources (if available): X/Twitter, StockTwits, Facebook investing groups, and private trading communities.
  - Metrics to extract: number of PLTR posts per day, sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral), top topics, sentiment momentum, notable quotes, and any “buy/hold/sell” lean signals.
- News and company events
  - Headlines and summaries from the past week: earnings or quarterly updates, new partnerships or government contracts, product/AI developments, regulatory or legal updates, major analyst notes, and market-wide catalysts (sector rotations, AI hype).

What the data would tell us (interpretation guide)
- Positive sentiment drivers to watch
  - Strong AI product adoption signals, big contract wins, better-than-expected commercial monetization, favorable analyst upgrades.
- Negative sentiment drivers to watch
  - Delays in product delivery, dilution concerns, valuation skepticism, regulatory or compliance worries, competitive pressure.
- Neutral or mixed signals
  - Routine platform updates, minor partnerships, or headlines with limited impact on fundamentals.
- Sentiment vs. price implications
  - Short-term: spikes in positive Reddit chatter can correlate with intraday moves, but often fade—watch for confirmation via price action and volume.
  - Medium-term: sustained shift in sentiment (positive or negative) may precede or coincide with earnings timing and guidance.

What to look for in the news (last week)
- Any contract announcements with government or enterprise clients.
- AI/Platform updates that expand use cases or reduce total cost of ownership.
- Regulatory or privacy-related developments affecting Palantir’s data handling.
- Leadership comments on strategy, growth segments (commercial vs. government), and profitability trajectory.

How I’d present the findings (structure)
- Executive snapshot: Summary of sentiment trend, key drivers, and actionable implications.
- Day-by-day sentiment trend: Positive/Neutral/Negative counts per day, with notable outliers.
- Top topics by volume and sentiment: E.g., "AI partnerships," "regulatory risk," "pricing discipline," "government contracts."
- News impact matrix: Short blurb for each major headline with potential price/volatility implications.
- Risk assessment: Key catalysts that could swing sentiment and upside/downside scenarios.
- Trader guidance: Short-term actions (if any) and longer-term considerations, with risk controls.

Recommended Makrdown table (to organize key points)
You can paste actual data into this table once the data tool returns. It’s designed for quick reading and decision-making.

| Date | Source | Sentiment | Main Topic / Headline | Post Volume (approx) | Notable Quote / Theme | Potential Implication for PLTR | Confidence / Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| 2025-10-07 | Reddit | Positive | Example: AI product deployment milestone | High | “Palantir’s new module cuts onboarding time by 40%” | Possible near-term bounce; watch for follow-through in price/volume | High confidence in signal if corroborated by price action |
| 2025-10-08 | Reddit | Neutral | Example: Partnership rumor with enterprise client | Medium | “Still early; no contract sign yet” | Limited immediate price impact; sentiment may drift | Medium confidence; verify with official news |
| 2025-10-09 | Reddit | Negative | Example: valuation concerns vs. growth | High | “Stock seems overvalued vs. growth runway” | Potential headwind; risk of pullback if no catalysts | Moderate confidence; look for catalysts to offset |
| 2025-10-10 | News | Positive | Government contract win announced | High | “PLTR secures multi-year contract” | Could support upside potential; check guidance impact | High confidence if confirmed by multiple outlets |
| 2025-10-11 | Reddit | Negative | Regulatory/privacy concerns | Medium | “Data usage policy scrutiny” | Heightened risk; potential volatility | Medium confidence; monitor official statements |

What I need from you
- If you want, I can retry the Reddit data fetch now. Just say “Retry.”
- Otherwise, I can proceed with a detailed qualitative PLTR sentiment/news report using the plan above and provide a filled-in version as soon as the data tool is available, plus a filled table when you provide the data.
- If you have a preferred date range (e.g., last 7 days vs. calendar week) or preferred sources beyond Reddit, tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or proceed with the plan and deliver a full qualitative report (with placeholders for live Reddit metrics until the tool returns)?
