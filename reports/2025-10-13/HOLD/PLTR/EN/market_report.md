I attempted to fetch PLTR data and run the listed indicators, but the data tool returned a file-not-found error. Parallel requests to retrieve multiple indicators also failed due to the same issue. I can retry the data fetch now, or you can authorize me to proceed with the indicator framework using the expected data once available. In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan: the 8 indicators I’ll use (once data is retrieved) and how they’ll help for PLTR today.

Selected indicators (8) and rationale
- close_50_sma
  - What it provides: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why use for PLTR: Helps confirm the prevailing trend (bullish/bearish) and smooths daily noise from Palantir’s often volatile price moves.
- close_200_sma
  - What it provides: Long-term trend benchmark; anchors major trend regime.
  - Why use for PLTR: Useful for confirming structural trend (e.g., whether price is in a longer-term uptrend or downtrend) and spotting potential golden/death-cross setups with the 50 SMA.
- close_10_ema
  - What it provides: Responsive short-term momentum signal.
  - Why use for PLTR: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry/exit points when price action accelerates.
- macd
  - What it provides: Core momentum signal via the difference of two EMAs; crossovers signal potential trend changes.
  - Why use for PLTR: Complements trend view from the SMAs with momentum direction and strength; helpful in confirming breakouts or pullbacks.
- macdh
  - What it provides: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence insight.
  - Why use for PLTR: Adds a sense of momentum acceleration/deceleration and helps identify weakening movements before a MACD cross occurs.
- rsi
  - What it provides: Relative strength momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why use for PLTR: Can flag potential reversals, but be mindful in strong trends where RSI can remain overbought/oversold for extended periods.
- atr
  - What it provides: Volatility level via average true range.
  - Why use for PLTR: Useful for risk management (position sizing, stop placement) and understanding current volatility regime, which can affect entry timing.
- vwma
  - What it provides: Volume-weighted trend perspective; price action filtered by volume.
  - Why use for PLTR: Helps validate price moves with volume, filtering out low-volume noise and supporting more reliable entries/exits.

How these indicators can be interpreted together for PLTR
- Trend confirmation:
  - If price stays above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma, with the 50 crossing above the 200 (golden cross) and the 10_ema riding above price, this suggests a constructive medium- to long-term trend. VWMA should align with price moves (volume-supported uptrends).
- Momentum confirmation:
  - MACD turning positive with an increasing macdh (positive histogram) strengthens a bullish setup; MACD cross above signal line reinforces momentum. RSI in a non-extreme zone (e.g., not near 90 or 10) supports sustainable momentum rather than overbought/oversold reversals.
- Volatility and risk management:
  - ATR rising indicates higher volatility; in a breakout scenario, use ATR to position stops larger than normal or adjust risk per trade. If ATR compresses while price breaks a key resistance, it may precede a volatility expansion.
- Volume validation:
  - VWMA confirming a move (price above VWMA with rising VWMA) adds conviction; if price breaks resistance with weak volume, the move may be unsustainable.

Cautions and scenario planning
- Don’t rely on a single indicator. Even with bullish crossovers, Palantir’s stock can experience whipsaws in choppy markets.
- RSI can stay overbought in strong uptrends; use it with MACD and SMA/EMA signals to avoid false reversals.
- In bearish scenarios, price crossing below the 50/200 SMA, MACD turning negative with a negative histogram, RSI breaking below 50, and ATR rising could forecast a pullback or trend change; use VWMA and ATR to gauge risk and exit timing.
- Always consider the big picture: PLTR’s valuations, earnings/tech-sector context, and broader market regime can influence how cleanly these indicators play out.

Next steps
- I will retry fetching the data (PLTR from 2024-10-13 to 2025-10-13) and then pull the 8 indicators listed above. If you’d like, I can also proceed with a hypothetical example or a shorter lookback once data is available.
- If you prefer, you can provide a data snapshot or allow me to proceed with a backup data source and I’ll run the analysis immediately.

Key indicators summary (for quick reference)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum
- macd: Momentum trend changes
- macdh: Momentum strength/divergence
- rsi: Momentum overbought/oversold and potential reversals
- atr: Volatility and risk management
- vwma: Volume-weighted trend confirmation

Markdown table: key points by indicator
- Indicator | What it measures | How to use for PLTR
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Check price position relative to 50SMA; look for crossovers with price as a trend signal
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Use with crossovers to gauge regime; confirm with other signals
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Track quick shifts; use for timely entries with longer-term filters
- macd | Momentum direction and trend changes | Look for MACD line crossing the signal line; confirm with histogram trend
- macdh | Momentum strength; divergence | Observe histogram changes for early momentum shifts
- rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold | Watch for 70/30 thresholds and divergences; use with trend context
- atr | Volatility level | Set stops and adapt position size to current volatility
- vwma | Volume-weighted price trend | Validate price moves with volume; prefer moves that are VWMA-directed
