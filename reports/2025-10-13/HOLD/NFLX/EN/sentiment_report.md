Sorry — I tried to fetch NFLX Reddit sentiment data for 2025-10-13 but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the Reddit feed now, or proceed with a solid framework and fill in the data as soon as the tool succeeds. Here’s how I propose to move forward and what I can deliver right away.

What I can deliver right now (framework and placeholders)
- Executive summary (to be filled once Reddit data is retrieved): A high-level read on whether public sentiment around NFLX over the past week is predominantly constructive or cautious, plus any notable shifts tied to recent headlines or events.
- Key drivers to watch (categories I’ll quantify from sentiment data and news):
  - Subscriber dynamics (growth vs churn, international vs domestic)
  - Content slate and user engagement (new releases, returning favorites, cancellations)
  - Pricing & monetization moves (ad-supported tier, price hikes, password sharing controls)
  - Competitive and macro context (streaming peers, ad markets, consumer discretionary spending)
  - Financial vs product catalysts (any earnings hints, guidance, or investor-day signals)
- Sentiment data plan (daily granularity):
  - I will break out sentiment by day for the past 7 days, highlight spikes, and correlate with notable headlines.
  - I will categorize sentiment themes (positive, neutral, negative) and map them to potential trading implications.
- News and social signals to synthesize:
  - Relevant Netflix headlines from the past week (policy changes, content strategy shifts, partnerships, earnings hints, device/feature updates).
  - Reddit thread themes (if present): subscriber growth optimism/pessimism, content criticism, pricing discussions, technical issues, ad-tier reception.
- Trading implications and scenarios:
  - If sentiment tilts positive with constructive headlines, potential for bullish momentum on a break of key levels.
  - If sentiment is mixed or negative with unfavorable headlines, watch for risk-off moves or a retest of support zones.
  - Key levels to watch (historical ranges, post-earnings moves, volatility regimes) and possible catalysts (upcoming earnings, product launches, international expansion news).
- Risks and caveats:
  - Reddit sentiment is just one lens; corroborate with official earnings/financial data and other social channels.
  - News headlines can be noisy; differentiate between sentiment about user experience vs. macro concerns.

Proposed next steps
- I can reattempt the Reddit data pull for NFLX on 2025-10-13 (and/or fetch a rolling 7-day window if you prefer) and then deliver a complete, data-backed long-form report with a final Markdown table.
- If you’d like, I can also proceed with an initial qualitative analysis using publicly available Netflix news and broad social sentiment in parallel while the Reddit feed is retried. Just say the word.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now? If you prefer, I can proceed with the framework above and fill in the data as soon as Reddit results are back, ensuring the final report includes the requested Markdown table. Here is the structure I will deliver once data is in:

Provisional report structure (to be filled after data retrieval)
- Executive summary
- Data inputs and methodology
- Daily sentiment overview (7-day window)
  - Day, sentiment score, top themes
- Reddit thread themes (top 5 by volume, with sentiment)
- News sweep (past week)
- Price/volume context (intraday moves,ATR, IV, etc.)
- Risk factors and scenario analysis
- Trading implications and recommended stance
- Appendix: sources, data caveats
- Markdown table: Key points at a glance

Proposed Markdown table (placeholder until data arrives)
| Topic | Key Sentiment/Signal (from Reddit and news) | Data Source | Implications for Traders | Confidence |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Overall sentiment | N/A (data pending) | Reddit (7-day window) | Awaiting data to gauge directionality | TBD |
| Subscriber dynamics | N/A | Reddit threads + headlines | If positive sentiment aligns with subscriber growth chatter, potential upside if confirmed | TBD |
| Pricing/monetization | N/A | Reddit threads | Watch for price-hike/ads feedback; potential pullback risk if negative | TBD |
| Content slate / engagement | N/A | Reddit threads + news | Positive buzz around new releases could lift near-term momentum | TBD |
| Competitive/market context | N/A | News roundups | Broader market sentiment may cap gains if peers show strength | TBD |
| Key risks | N/A | All sources | Identify risks that could trigger downside moves | TBD |

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now
- Or proceed with the framework and I’ll deliver the full report as soon as Reddit data is available (with the final Markdown table filled in)
