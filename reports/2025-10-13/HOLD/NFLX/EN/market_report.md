Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch NFLX data and the requested indicators, but I’m encountering a system error when calling the data tools (FileNotFoundError). I can still provide a well-structured, nuanced framework using the 8 most relevant indicators for NFLX and outline how to interpret them once data retrieval is successful. As soon as the data tools are available again, I’ll run the actual values and generate concrete signals.

Selected indicators (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these 8 indicators are suitable for NFLX
- Trend and structural context
  - close_50_sma and close_200_sma provide medium- and long-term trend context. They help identify whether NFLX is in an uptrend, downtrend, or range, and can serve as dynamic support/resistance levels.
  - The interaction of 50 and 200 SMAs (golden cross or death cross) offers a strategic bias view, especially as NFLX often experiences regime shifts around earnings and platform-related catalysts.

- Momentum assessment
  - macd, macds, and macdh collectively reveal momentum strength and potential inflection points. MACD crossovers (macd vs macds) can signal momentum changes, while the MACD histogram (macdh) shows momentum divergence/convergence strength.

- Relative strength and potential reversals
  - rsi provides a momentum gauge to flag overbought/oversold conditions and possible reversals, particularly useful for a high-growth/fundamental-driven name like NFLX where sentiment and catalysts can drive sharp moves.

- Volatility and risk context
  - boll (Bollinger Middle) captures the dynamic benchmark (20 SMA) around which price tends to oscillate; useful for breakouts and pullback considerations.
  - atr measures true volatility and is essential for risk management (position sizing and stop placement), particularly in earnings weeks or major user-growth announcements where volatility spikes.

How this combination provides a coherent NFLX view
- A bullish setup would typically show: price trading above the 50 and 200 SMAs, MACD line above signal with positive histogram, RSI comfortably above 50 (not overbought), and price touching or testing the upper Bollinger band with ATR elevated (indicating active momentum and higher risk-reward).
- A bearish setup would typically show: price below the 50 and 200 SMAs, MACD line below signal with negative histogram, RSI dipping toward or below 50, and price moving toward or breaking the lower Bollinger band, with ATR rising to reflect increased volatility.
- A consolidation/range scenario might present: price oscillating near the middle Bollinger band, MACD and RSI fluctuating around neutral, and ATR relatively contained. In such contexts, trend-following entries may be scarce and risk management becomes crucial.

Operational guidance (to use once data is available)
- Use the SMA ensemble as a trend filter: prefer long entries when price is above both 50 and 200 SMAs; consider waiting for MACD confirmation (cross above) and RSI not in extreme overbought territory.
- Use MACD-derived signals as momentum confirmations: a bullish MACD cross with increasing histogram supports a tilt toward long entries; a bearish cross with negative histogram supports cautious or short-side considerations.
- Use RSI with trend awareness: in strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; combine with the SMA trend signal to avoid chasing pullbacks in a strong trend.
- Use Bollinger context for entry/exit zones: a breakout above the upper band in concert with rising ATR can signal a tradable move; a close inside the bands after a band breakout may indicate a pullback or consolidation.
- Use ATR for risk control: adjust stop-loss placement and position sizing with current volatility levels to maintain favorable risk-reward.

Current limitations and next steps
- Data access issue: The underlying data fetch attempt failed with a FileNotFoundError. I’m ready to rerun all eight indicators as soon as the data tool is restored. If you’d like, I can retry immediately or wait for confirmation that the data pipeline is back online.
- In the meantime, I can generate a concrete, data-driven decision framework once I have the values (e.g., “If price = X, MACD = Y, RSI = Z, ATR = A, then consider long/short with stop at B and target at C”). Just say the word and I’ll produce the signals.

Proposed next steps
- Retry data retrieval for NFLX (all eight indicators) as soon as the data service is available.
- If you prefer, I can also reduce to a focused subset (e.g., 50/200 SMA, MACD, RSI, ATR) for a quicker read, and expand to the full 8 once data comes back.
- If you’re watching earnings cycles or specific catalysts (e.g., content deals, subscriber trends), I can tailor the interpretation rules to those event windows.

Appendix: quick reference table (indicator summary)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance; used as a trend filter; watch for price above/below with 50 vs 200 cross signals.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; confirms macro direction; golden/death cross with 50 SMA is especially informative.
- macd: Momentum gauge; crossovers signal potential trend changes; best when used with other filters.
- macds: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD provide actionable momentum signals.
- macdh: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence at a glance.
- rsi: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold cues; use with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- boll: Bollinger middle; baseline for price oscillation; consider breakouts near bands with other confirmations.
- atr: Volatility scale; informs stop placement and risk management.

Markdown table: key points at a glance
- Indicator | Category | What it tells you | How to use for NFLX
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Use as a trend filter; tilt bias toward long when price is above 50, especially if 50 > 200
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; major support/resistance context | Confirm macro direction; golden/death cross with 50 SMA adds conviction
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum shifts; potential trend changes | Look for MACD line above signal with positive histogram to support longs; bearish cross for caution
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line behavior | Use crossovers with MACD for trade triggers; corroborate with price action
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergence | Divergence in macdh can precede price moves; use with other filters
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold and momentum strength | Avoid overreliance in strong trends; combine with trend direction
- boll | Volatility Indicators | Baseline of price oscillations; breakout potential | Breakouts toward upper band with rising ATR can signal entry zones
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Current market volatility level | Set stops and position sizes proportionally; adapt to volatility regime changes

If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now and then provide a full, data-grounded interpretation with concrete signals as soon as the data is accessible.
