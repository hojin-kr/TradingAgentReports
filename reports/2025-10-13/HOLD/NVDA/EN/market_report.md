I’m running into an issue fetching NVDA data from the current data backend (FileNotFoundError in the data service). I can’t pull the latest price/indicator data right now. If you’d like, I can retry in a moment, or you can confirm a narrower date range or a specific data source. In the meantime, here’s a focused, non-data-driven plan with a complementary set of indicators you can rely on once data is available. I’ll also include a compact interpretation framework tailored to NVDA’s typical characteristics (high volatility, tech/AI exposure).

Selected indicators (up to 8, chosen for complementary insights and minimal redundancy)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these 8 are suitable for NVDA
- Trend foundation: close_50_sma and close_200_sma give you medium- and long-term trend context. They help filter trades and identify regime shifts (e.g., bullish when price sits above both, bearish when below both, with crossovers signaling potential changes).
- Momentum timing: close_10_ema provides a quick read on short-term momentum, useful for early entries or exits in a volatile name like NVDA.
- MACD family for momentum changes: macd (the MACD line), macds (signal line), and macdh (histogram) offer a cohesive view of momentum strength, crossovers, and divergence. Together they help confirm or question signals from price and other indicators, reducing false positives.
- Relative strength gauge: rsi helps identify overbought/oversold conditions and possible reversals, especially when aligned with trend signals from the SMAs and MACD.
- Volatility/risk management: atr provides a quantitative read on current volatility, informing stop placement and position sizing in NVDA’s often wide-ranging moves.

How to interpret these indicators together (when data is available)
- Trend alignment: Look for price trading above both 50SMA and 200SMA for a bullish context; below both for bearish. Crossovers (e.g., 50SMA crossing above/below 200SMA) can signal longer-term trend shifts (golden/death crosses).
- Short-term timing: A price move above/below the 10 EMA aligned with a MACD bullish/bearish crossover (and MACD histogram expansion) strengthens a signal.
- Momentum confirmation: If RSI is moving away from overbought/oversold thresholds in the direction of the main trend (e.g., RSI rising in an uptrend), it strengthens the signal; if RSI diverges against price, be cautious.
- Volatility management: Rising ATR suggests higher risk and wider price swings—adjust stops and position sizes accordingly; use ATR-based stop placement to avoid premature exits in NVDA’s volatile sessions.
- Signals with multiple confirmations: A bullish setup would ideally involve price above 50SMA/200SMA, a bullish MACD cross (MACD above MACD signal and MACD histogram positive), RSI not in extreme overbought territory, and a reasonable ATR level indicating manageable risk.

Quick actionable checklist (once data is live)
- Check trend: Is price above both 50SMA and 200SMA? If not, prefer risk-managed entries or wait for alignment.
- Check momentum: Is MACD above its signal with a growing histogram? Is RSI confirming momentum (not overbought if entering long)?
- Manage risk: Is ATR elevated? If yes, widen stops or reduce position size accordingly.
- Confirm with multiple signals: Ideally, retrieve at least 2–3 independent confirmations (trend + momentum + volatility) before acting.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation framework
| Indicator | What it measures | How to use (NVDA context) | Signal interpretation guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Use to confirm trend direction and potential pullbacks; act as filter for entries | Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend; price below suggests downtrend or pullback risk |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend; strategic benchmark | Confirm long-term regime (bullish/bearish) and major transition signals | Golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) or death cross signals trend shifts |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum; responsive to quick shifts | Timely entry/exit cues; pair with longer-term trend for filtering | Price crossing above/below 10 EMA with momentum confirms a move; noise in choppy markets if used alone |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Core momentum read; use with MACD signal (macds) and histogram (macdh) for confirmation | Bullish cross (MACD above signal) with positive histogram supports long entries; bearish cross supports exits |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoother confirmation of MACD-driven signals | MACD crossing MACDS strengthens the trade signal; use to reduce false positives |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Visual gauge of momentum strength and divergence | Expanding positive histogram reinforces bullish moves; contracting/negative suggests weakening momentum |
| rsi | Relative strength momentum; overbought/oversold | Watch for divergence with price and confirm trend signals | RSI rising toward 70+ in an uptrend can stay elevated; RSI dropping near 30 during pullbacks may signal a bounce |
| atr | Market volatility level | Adjust risk management (stops, position sizing) based on volatility | Rising ATR implies higher volatility; widen stops or reduce position size; falling ATR suggests tighter stops |

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can re-run once the data service is available again. If you can share a preferred date range or allow me to use the latest available data, I’ll generate the 8-indicator report and provide a detailed, date-specific trend analysis with entry/exit ideas.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with a qualitative NVDA narrative based on typical post-earnings and market conditions, but it won’t reflect the exact current data until the fetch works.

Would you like me to retry fetching NVDA data now, or should I continue with a qualitative NVDA scenario while we wait for the data service to come back online?
