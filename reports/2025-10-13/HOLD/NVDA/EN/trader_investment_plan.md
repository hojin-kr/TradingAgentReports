Assessment:
- The plan you provided for NVDA is cautious and data-dependent. With the current data outage and ongoing policy/regulatory risk (export controls, China exposure) layered over a high valuation, a constrained upside setup is prudent. The core thesis remains valid (AI cycle, CUDA ecosystem, supply/demand dynamics), but near-term catalysts are uncertain. A Hold with hedges aligns with balancing risk and the potential for clearer signals when data flow resumes.

Recommendation:
- Hold NVDA now, with protective hedges in place. Avoid adding meaningful new long exposure until data reliability returns and a constructive technical setup confirms momentum. Be prepared to upgrade to Buy in a staged manner if and when data signals and price action confirm a durable bullish setup.

Actionable plan (aligned with your framework)
1) If you are already long
- Maintain core position but add downside protection:
  - Buy puts around the 180–190 level with 2–3 months to expiry (or implement a put spread/collar to fund the protection).
  - Consider a collar: long NVDA, short near-term calls to offset puts, or a put-spread to cap cost.
- Do not chase new highs until data reliability and catalysts improve.

2) If you are flat or lightly exposed
- Avoid initiating a large long until data flow recovers and the setup improves.
- You may deploy a very small, conditional starter only if price holds above a conservative level with confirming volume, but keep exposure limited and hedges in mind.

3) Data recovery and Buy triggers (post-recovery)
- Trigger for upgrading to Buy (scenario A):
  - Sustained close above a defined resistance with positive MACD, plus disciplined risk given volatility (e.g., ATR context supports a lower-risk entry).
  - Prefer a staged approach: begin with a partial add then complete to a full position as confirmations accumulate.
- Scenario B (hold as baseline): mixed signals or data noise; maintain hedges and avoid scaling in.

4) Risk controls and hedging
- Position sizing: cap NVDA exposure within the specified portfolio limit; reduce concentration if hedges are in place.
- Dynamic hedging: rebalance hedges as volatility shifts; use shorter-dated hedges if headlines drive near-term spikes.
- Diversification: maintain exposure to complementary AI names or related sectors to mitigate single-name risk.

5) Catalysts and review cadence
- Monitor: policy/regulatory updates, China exposure commentary, AI capex cadence in non-China regions, memory/HBM supply signals.
- Review: reassess in 1–2 weeks or sooner if data services resume and price-action signals emerge.
- Post-mortem: apply learning from price moves and headlines to avoid chasing without confirmation.

Final thought:
- This stance prioritizes risk management in the absence of reliable data and clear near-term catalysts, while preserving optionality to shift to a constructive Buy if and when data and price action align.
