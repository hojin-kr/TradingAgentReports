Recommendation: Hold AMD now.

Rationale
- The bull case remains credible: AI/data-center tailwinds, 2nm efficiency gains (MI450), ROCm ecosystem expansion, and diversified growth. These could support higher cash flows and margins over time.
- The bear case is equally concrete: execution/timing risk (ramp of MI450, ROCm adoption, OpenAI backlog visibility), macro/policy headwinds, and competitive pressure from Nvidia. Without clear near-term backlog visibility and confirmed cadence, a higher multiple isn’t justified yet.
- The plan’s logic is to avoid over-optimism on a single catalyst and to demand verifiable milestones before upgrading to a more bullish stance. Current data do not yet confirm durable cash-flow visibility or margin expansion on a near-term horizon.

Current stance and risk controls
- Hold, with disciplined risk management: maintain a core position within your risk cap and use tiered entries to avoid overexposure to a single milestone.
- Implement milestone-driven triggers to upgrade or downgrade:
  - Upgrade to Buy only if all of the following are verifiable and material: credible OpenAI/hyperscaler backlog with long-term commitments, MI450 2nm ramp on schedule with healthy yields, ROCm enterprise deployments with solid revenue signals, and PS6/Amethyst milestones on track.
  - Downgrade to Sell if any key milestone slips materially (e.g., >1–2 quarters delay or deteriorating backlog), policy/macro headlines worsen demand/margins, or a larger competitive gap reduces pricing power.

Actionable plan
- Position management: maintain a cautious stance, size exposure to your predefined risk cap; consider smaller adds only upon confirmed milestone progress.
- Risk controls: use ATR-based stops and consider hedging collars if you’re comfortable with options to protect downside while preserving upside.
- Monitoring: track OpenAI/hyperscaler backlog signals, MI450 2nm ramp progress, ROCm enterprise wins, and gaming/PS6 cadence; adjust exposure if data flow strengthens or weakens.
- Contingent readiness: be prepared to upgrade to Buy on clear, data-backed milestones; be prepared to downgrade to Sell if milestones miss or macro/policy risk escalates.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can build a data-backed base/bear/bull scenario with explicit price targets and probability-weighted expectations once the data streams resume.
- Otherwise, maintain Hold now and revisit promptly as milestones unfold.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
