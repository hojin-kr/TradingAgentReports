# Daily Trading Intelligence: AMD

## Executive Snapshot
- Structural driver: AI infrastructure cycle remains the dominant long-run catalyst. AMD’s OpenAI AI-chip deployment and multi-GW ramp support durable data-center demand and gross-margin potential.
- Policy risk: U.S. Senate export-curbs on AI chips to China and tariff talk introduce near-term volatility and risk-off episodes on headlines.
- Cadence and catalysts: 2nm MI450 roadmap, ROCm 7.x, Zen 6 on AM5, and PS6/Project Amethyst collaboration reinforce multi-year upgrade and AI-enabled graphics cycle.
- Sentiment/valuation: Upgrades and higher targets tied to the OpenAI partnership; execution and valuation risk remain concerns in an AI-hype backdrop.

## Macro and Market Backdrop
- AI hardware cycle: Multi-year capex tailwinds; demand visibility driven by OpenAI partnerships and hyperscaler deployments.
- Policy/geopolitics: Export controls and tariff rhetoric fuel volatility in semis; policy headlines can trigger risk-off moves.
- Supply chain and tech cadence: 2nm node ambitions heighten importance of Taiwan/TSMC lead times and materials; ROCm ecosystem growth supports enterprise adoption.
- Gaming cycle: PS6 and RDNA graphics reinforce durable demand beyond pure data-center exposure.

## Price Action and Technical Levels
- Current price levels: [Live data required to populate exact figures]. Expect near-term sensitivity to policy headlines and OpenAI ramp progress.
- Technical setup (framework; fill with live data):
  - Short-term trend: [up/down] dependent on policy news and AI-deployment cadence.
  - Key levels to watch (once price data available):
    - Support: **S1: TBD**, **S2: TBD**
    - Resistance: **R1: TBD**, **R2: TBD**
- Indicators to monitor: volume acceleration with news on OpenAI ramp; 20/50/200-day moving average alignment; RSI/VWAP around policy-news windows.
- Immediate implications: A break above R1 on strong AI-card ramp could unlock upside; failure to hold S1 could trigger a test of S2.

## Trading Scenarios and Outlook
- Base Case
  - Narrative: OpenAI ramp remains on-track; 2nm MI450 cadence remains credible; policy headlines abate.
  - Price trajectory: If AMD holds above S1, expect range-bound above support with a reversion toward mid-to-upper range.
  - Targets (from current level, placeholder):
    - Upside: **+2% to +8%** toward near-term resistance.
    - Risk controls: long exposure above S1 with tight stop below S2; trim on failed tests of S1.
- Bull Case
  - Narrative: OpenAI ramp accelerates; MI450/2nm milestones advance ahead of schedule; PS6 collaboration strengthens consumer/GPU demand.
  - Price trajectory: Break above R1 with sustained momentum; potential re-rating on AI-infrastructure visibility.
  - Targets:
    - Upside: **+12% to +18%** from current price, approaching R2 and prior highs if backlog converts to revenue and gross margin materializes.
    - Risk controls: position size increased on clear breakout confirmation; profits taken on any reversal below S1.
- Bear Case
  - Narrative: Policy shocks persist or AI demand cools; execution risk or dilution concerns emerge; supply-chain delays bite MI450 ramp.
  - Price trajectory: Breakdown below S2 with potential acceleration to test lower supports.
  - Targets:
    - Downside: **-8% to -15%** from current level if policy headlines trigger risk-off and growth outlook dims.
    - Risk controls: hedging via puts or capped downside exposure; stop-loss triggers below S2 and/or on break of key daily down-move patterns.

Risk management and position guidance
- Position sizing: scale into confirmation signals (breakout/breakdown) to manage policy-driven volatility.
- Stops: place stops just beyond S2 on weak downside or below confirmed support on a downside break.
- Hedging: consider protective puts or short-dated options around policy-news windows to manage tail risk.
- Monitoring cadence: track OpenAI ramp progress, MI450 qualification/milestones, ROCm ecosystem uptake, and regulatory developments weekly.
