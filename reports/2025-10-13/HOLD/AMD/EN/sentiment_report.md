I ran into a tool error fetching Reddit data for AMD (FileNotFoundError) across the requested dates. The Reddit data fetcher is currently returning an internal error, so I don’t have the day-by-day sentiment feed to synthesize yet.

What I can do right now
- Retry the Reddit data pull as soon as the tool is available again.
- If you want, proceed with an interim analysis using other publicly available sources (e.g., AMD news headlines, earnings/product announcements) once you grant access to those sources or if you’d like me to integrate non-Reddit sentiment from other channels you specify.
- Prepare the full long-form report with the same structure as soon as Reddit data is retrieved, including a detailed day-by-day sentiment breakdown, notable themes, and trader implications.

Proposed next steps
1) I retry the Reddit data fetch for AMD for the dates 2025-10-07 through 2025-10-13 as soon as the tool is back online.
2) Once data is retrieved, I’ll produce:
   - A daily sentiment delta (percent bullish vs bearish, neutral, and any strong outliers).
   - Top recurring themes (e.g., Ryzen/EPYC demand signals, GPU pricing, supply chain chatter, AI compute demand).
   - Any correlation with AMD company news in the same window.
   - Trader implications (volatility drivers, potential catalysts, risk factors).
3) I’ll append a Markdown table at the end with a concise summary of key points.

If you’d like me to proceed with an alternative data path right away, tell me which sources you trust (e.g., mainstream tech news, AMD press releases, earnings call transcripts, or other social channels), and I can start building a cross-source sentiment and event layer in parallel.

Inline plan for the eventual full report (structure you’ll see once data is in)
- Executive snapshot: overall sentiment trend over the week, standout events.
- Daily sentiment map: day-by-day percentages and notable Reddit post clusters.
- Thematic breakdown: top topics driving sentiment (e.g., product cycle expectations, AI demand, competitive dynamics, supply chain/logistics).
- News vs sentiment synthesis: how company announcements aligned with sentiment shifts.
- Risk and opportunity framing for traders: catalysts, tail risks, and hedging considerations.
- Implications by sentiment regime (e.g., bullish with rising volume vs. bearish reversal signals).
- Visuals: brief sentiment line charts (descriptions if visuals aren’t render-ready in this channel).
- Key takeaways and actionable notes.

Draft Markdown table (structure to fill with data once retrieved)
- Date | Reddit Sentiment (Bullish %) | Reddit Sentiment (Bearish %) | Net Delta | Notable Themes | Related AMD News Headlines | Implied Trader Implications

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull now, or would you prefer I switch to an alternative data path (and if so, which sources should I prioritize)?
