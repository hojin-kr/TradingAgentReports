I’m running into a data-access issue pulling AMD data with get_YFin_data (Error: FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). It looks like the backend data source isn’t accessible right now. I can retry fetching the data, or, if you prefer, I can provide a thorough indicator framework and a qualitative, data-agnostic analysis plan for AMD in the meantime. Which would you prefer?

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) that provide complementary insights for AMD, along with the rationale and how I’d interpret them once the data is available.

Chosen indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll_ub
- atr

Rationale for the selection
- Trend and structural context
  - close_50_sma and close_200_sma: The 50-day and 200-day moving averages help establish the medium-to-long-term trend and dynamic support/resistance levels. They guide strategic positioning (bullish below/above crossovers, bearish in downtrends). The 200 SMA is especially useful for higher-timeframe bias (long-term trend) for AMD, which often trades with multi-quarter cycles tied to product launches, data-center demand, and AI-related capex.
  - close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum guide. Helps detect quicker shifts in trend direction that may precede longer-term moves signaled by the SMAs. Use to time entries with awareness of the inherent noise in short windows.

- Momentum and signal confirmation
  - macd, macds: The MACD line and its signal provide momentum cues and potential trend-change signals (crossovers, divergences). They’re most reliable when used with trend context from the moving averages and other filters, particularly in a sector with episodic volatility like semiconductors.
  - rsi: A robust momentum oscillator to identify potential overbought/oversold conditions and to spot divergences. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods, so it’s important to confirm with trend analysis and price action.

- Volatility and breakout context
  - boll_ub: The Bollinger Upper Band helps identify potential breakout zones and overextended price action in the context of volatility. In a sector prone to rapid moves (e.g., around earnings or AI-cycle news), the upper band can mark zones where price extension and continued strength may occur—but signals should be confirmed with other tools.
  - atr: A core volatility/risk-management metric. ATR informs position sizing and stop placement. Higher ATR implies wider price swings and necessitates larger stops or reduced position size to maintain risk discipline.

How I would interpret these indicators for AMD (once data is available)
- Trend view: If AMD is trading above both the 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with the 50 crossing above the 200 (golden cross) or holding above them, the medium-to-long-term bias would be bullish. If prices are below these levels, the bias would be bearish or neutral until a clear reversion occurs.
- Short-term momentum: A bullish cross of MACD with MACD above its signal line and above zero would reinforce a bullish setup, especially if price is above the 10 EMA and near/above the 50 SMA. Conversely, a MACD cross below the signal line and/or below zero would warn of a pullback or trend pause.
- Entry timing vs. risk management: Use 10 EMA crossovers and price action relative to the 50/200 SMA to time entries in the direction of the primary trend signaled by the moving averages and MACD. RSI confirming momentum (not overextended) would give additional confidence; if RSI is overbought in an uptrend, wait for a retrace or a breakout pullback confirmed by ATR-based stops.
- Breakouts and volatility: If price tests the Bollinger upper band and maintains energy with rising ATR, that could indicate a continuation breakout in a strong upmove. If price hits the upper band but RSI shows divergence or MACD loses momentum, be cautious of a potential pullback.
- Risk controls: Use ATR to adjust stop distances as volatility expands or contracts. For example, a higher ATR environment would require wider stops to avoid premature exits, provided the trend remains intact per MACD and MA signals.

Practical usage notes and cautions
- Indicators should be combined for signal confirmation. For example, a price move above the 50 SMA with a MACD bullish crossover and RSI not in extreme overbought territory adds more conviction than any single signal.
- Be mindful of sector-specific risk factors for AMD (earnings cadence, AI demand cycles, GPU margins, supply/demand dynamics). Signals may tighten up or extend in reaction to quarterly results or AI-related news.
- In choppy markets, rely more on MACD/MMA-based trend confirmation and use ATR to avoid over-positioning during high-volatility periods.
- Avoid over-reliance on any single indicator. The 8-indicator framework here is designed to cover trend (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum (MACD family, RSI), and volatility (ATR, Bollinger upper).

Appendix: Key points table
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AMD | Practical usage notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average; mid-term trend | Price above suggests intermediate uptrend; price below suggests weakness or consolidation | Use to confirm trend direction; be aware of lag; filter signals with other momentum tools |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend | Price above indicates long-term bullish bias; price below indicates bearish bias | Use for strategic bias; monitor for golden/death cross with 50 SMA |
| close_10_ema | 10-day exponential moving average; short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below signals quick momentum shifts | Useful for entry/exit timing; respect potential noise in choppy markets |
| macd | MACD line; momentum impulse | Bullish cross above zero supports uptrend; bearish cross below zero supports downtrend | Confirm with price action and other indicators to avoid false positives |
| macds | MACD signal line; momentum smoothing | Cross of MACD vs MACDS strengthens/weakens signal | Helps time entries/exits with reduced false positives when combined with trend context |
| rsi | Relative strength index; momentum magnitude | RSI rising toward overbought; pullbacks possible in uptrends; divergence can warn reversals | Watch for divergences; use 70/30 thresholds in context of trend |
| boll_ub | Bollinger upper band; volatility/overextension | Approaching or testing upper band suggests possible breakout continuation or overextension | Use with other signals to confirm breakouts; beware of false positives in range-bound periods |
| atr | Average true range; volatility measure | Rising ATR indicates higher volatility; lowering ATR indicates compression | Use for position sizing and dynamic stops; adjust risk per volatility regime |

Next steps
- I can retry pulling AMD data with get_YFin_data as soon as the data source becomes available again. If you’d like, I can keep trying automatically and start generating the indicator outputs as soon as the dataset is accessible.
- Alternatively, if you approve a different date range or a different data source, I can proceed immediately with a fully data-driven, indicator-generated report.

Would you like me to:
- Retry fetching AMD data now and then generate a full, data-backed indicators report once successful, or
- Proceed with a strictly qualitative AMD analysis based on the provided framework while we wait for data access to be restored?
