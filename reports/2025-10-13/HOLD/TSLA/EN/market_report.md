I tried to fetch TSLA data for 2023-10-13 to 2025-10-13 using get_YFin_data, but the service returned a FileNotFoundError (the data source isn’t accessible right now). I can retry in a moment or proceed with an indicator-focused analysis based on TSLA’s typical behavior and the current market context. Below I provide a tightly reasoned set of indicators that would give diverse and complementary insights for TSLA, along with how to interpret them in a volatile, growth-focused stock like TSLA.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale and how to use for TSLA
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - TSLA context: In a volatile stock like TSLA, the 50 SMA helps filter noise and indicates whether the stock is in a broader uptrend or downtrend. A price trading above the 50 SMA is generally a bullish signal; a move below can foreshadow a deeper pullback, especially if accompanied by other weak signals.
  - Signals to watch: Price crossing above the 50 SMA after a pullback suggests potential continuation of the uptrend; a break below may signal mid-term weakness.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark and potential major support/resistance; crossovers with price are visually meaningful.
  - TSLA context: TSLA experiences powerful trend shifts around earnings and product news. The 200 SMA helps identify longer-term regime changes and potential golden/death cross signals.
  - Signals to watch: Price above the 200 SMA aligns with a longer-term uptrend; a test or break below can indicate a significant trend risk, especially if accompanied by weak momentum.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  - Role: Responsive short-term momentum indicator to capture quick shifts.
  - TSLA context: TSLA is prone to rapid moves; the 10 EMA can highlight early momentum changes around catalysts.
  - Signals to watch: Price crossing above/below the 10 EMA can precede small entries/exits or confirm a shift when used with other signals.
- macd (MACD)
  - Role: Momentum and trend-change signal via the difference of two EMAs.
  - TSLA context: In a high-volatility stock, MACD crossovers help identify potential trend accelerations or reversals, especially when price is near key levels.
  - Signals to watch: MACD line crossing above the signal line (bullish) or below (bearish); convergence/divergence with price can reveal weakening or strengthening momentum.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Role: Momentum strength gauge; shows how far MACD is from its signal.
  - TSLA context: The histogram can provide early warning of momentum shifts before MACD line crossovers become obvious.
  - Signals to watch: Increasing positive histogram supports bullish momentum; decreasing or negative histogram indicates waning momentum.
- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - Role: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold cues.
  - TSLA context: RSI can overextend in strong rallies or dips; in volatile TSLA markets, divergence and proximity to extremes can provide insight into risk of reversal.
  - Signals to watch: RSI approaching 70-75 (overbought) may warn of a pullback, while 30-25 (oversold) can warn of a bounce; beware of staying in overbought/oversold during persistent trends.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - Role: Dynamic benchmark based on a 20-period moving average; baseline for volatility bands.
  - TSLA context: Boll middle helps gauge the “norm” around which TSLA moves. TSLA often has wide swings around catalysts; the middle line serves as a dynamic anchor.
  - Signals to watch: Price testing or bouncing from the Boll middle can indicate base-building or a continuation of the range; combined with band signals, it can highlight potential breakouts.
- atr (Average True Range)
  - Role: Volatility measure; informs risk management (stop placement, position sizing).
  - TSLA context: High ATR signals elevated volatility; adjusting risk and targets is critical around earnings or product announcements.
  - Signals to watch: Rising ATR suggests wider price swings ahead (use to widen stops or reduce position size); a contracting ATR can precede consolidation or a calm period before a move.

Notes on data access
- The data fetch tool is currently returning an internal error (FileNotFoundError). If you’d like, I can retry automatically after a brief interval, or we can proceed with the indicator framework above and then run a data-backed analysis once the data source is available.

Proposed next steps
- Option A: I retry get_YFin_data for TSLA as soon as the service is reachable, then generate a live, data-backed trend and signal report using the 8 indicators above.
- Option B: If you prefer, I can proceed with a more narrative, framework-based TSLA analysis using typical market conditions and known catalyst-driven patterns, clearly labeled as scenario-based rather than data-driven.

Markdown table: key indicators, roles, and signals for TSLA
| Indicator | Role | Key Signals to Watch (TSLA) | Why it matters for TSLA |
|-----------|------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Trend/dynamic support-resistance | Price above 50 SMA suggests uptrend; cross below may signal pullback | TSLA’s volatility benefits from a clear medium-term trend baseline to avoid choppy entries |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200 SMA aligns with long-term bullishness; break below indicates risk of larger drawdown | Helps identify regime shifts and confirm/deconfirm longer-term bias around catalysts |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing the 10 EMA can precede quick entries/exits; supports momentum shifts | Captures swift price moves around earnings/news; complements longer-term trends |
| macd | Momentum/trend-change | MACD crossover (line vs signal) and positive/negative divergence | Signals shifts in momentum which often precede sustained moves in TSLA |
| macdh | Momentum strength | MACD histogram slope and size indicate momentum acceleration or loss | Early warning of momentum exhaustion or acceleration beyond MACD crossovers |
| rsi | Momentum/overbought-oversold | RSI near extremes (overbought/oversold) and divergences | Helps assess risk of reversal during sharp rallies or declines; must be used with trend context |
| boll | Volatility framework baseline | Price interactions with Boll middle; potential breakout or mean-reversion cues with bands | Provides a volatility-aware frame to gauge normal vs. breakout behavior around catalysts |
| atr | Volatility/risk management | Rising ATR implies higher future price swings; falling ATR suggests consolidation | Guides stop placement and position sizing in a high-volatility stock like TSLA |

Would you like me to retry the TSLA data fetch now, or proceed with the data-backed report as soon as the data source is accessible? If you have a preferred date range or want me to include VWMA as an additional indicator, I can adjust the selection accordingly.
