# Investment Report: TSLA
## Executive Summary
Tesla shows upside from AI/robotics monetization and volume growth, but near-term risks could limit gains. A Hold preserves optionality while awaiting clearer near-term milestones.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term milestones for AI monetization and robotics growth could drive upside, but timing is uncertain.
- Holding avoids paying full price for potential upside that may be delayed; a hedged, tiered exposure helps limit downside.
- Ongoing demand signals and long-term potential support the case to wait for clearer evidence of durable improvement.

## Risks To Watch
- Self-driving software regulations and safety rules could affect monetization and timing.
- China margins and demand dynamics may weaken, impacting overall profitability.
- Macro headwinds and earnings volatility could drive unexpected moves in the stock.
- Any miss on key milestones or slower-than-expected progress could shift the view toward more caution.
