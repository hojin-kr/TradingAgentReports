Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock news for TSLA on 2025-10-13, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). It looks like the data service is temporarily unavailable on my end.

Options to move forward:
- Retry now or later: I can re-run the Reddit data pull as soon as the tool is back up.
- Switch to a manual synthesis: I can provide a thorough, trader-focused analysis based on recent public signals and known events over the past week, clearly labeled as qualitative until the data tool is functional again.
- Hybrid approach: I can draft a robust report outline and the Markdown table structure now, then populate it with live data as soon as the tool is working.

Proposed plan for the TSLA report (once data can be pulled)
- Scope: Social media sentiment (Reddit and other major channels), recent company news, and implied trader implications for TSLA over the past 7 days.
- Sentiment tracking:
  - Daily sentiment score (bullish/neutral/bearish) and volume
  - Notable spikes and potential catalysts
  - Top recurring themes (e.g., FSD updates, regulatory/regulatory scrutiny, price targets, manufacturing updates)
- News digest:
  - Key headlines (product launches, price changes, production milestones, earnings whispers or guidance)
  - Thematic impact on sentiment and potential short-term moves
- Market implications for traders:
  - Short-term catalysts and risks
  - Sentiment vs. price action observations
  - Potential option strategies or risk-managed plays around identified catalysts
- Deliverable: A long-form report with a final Markdown table summarizing key points

Proposed Markdown table structure (for the end of the report)
- Date | Daily Sentiment | Sentiment Volume | Top Themes | Notable News | Market Implication | Trader Takeaway

If youâ€™d like, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-grounded synthesis now (without the live Reddit feed) and then slot in the exact Reddit-derived figures once the tool is back. How would you like to proceed? Also, please confirm if you want the full 7-day window (latest 7 days up to 2025-10-13) or a different period.
