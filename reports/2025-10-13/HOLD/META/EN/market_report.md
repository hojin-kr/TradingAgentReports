I attempted to fetch META data and run the requested indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data pull now, but in the meantime I’ve prepared a detailed plan with a conservative, non-numeric interpretation and a clear rationale for the selected indicators. Once the data fetch succeeds, I’ll generate a full numeric, trend-aware report.

Selected indicators (8 total) with rationale for META
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to gauge whether price is in a bull/bear regime relative to mid-term trends.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark and important for confirmation of major trend direction (golden/death cross signals conceptually). Adds strategic trend context for META, a large-cap that can trade with multi-month horizons.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures quicker momentum shifts and potential entry/exit points when combined with longer-term averages to filter noise.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum gauge; crossovers with the signal line help identify trend changes and pullbacks within the prevailing trend.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoother signal line to confirm MACD crossovers and reduce false positives when combined with price action and other filters.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum indicator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences against price trends, aiding reversal vs. continuation judgments.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-SMA). Baseline for volatility bands; helps frame the current price relative to a standard deviation envelope and identify consolidation vs. breakout regimes.
- atr: ATR. Volatility gauge; sets context for risk management (e.g., stop placements, position sizing) and helps gauge whether price moves are high- or low-volatility.

Why these 8 provide diverse, complementary insights for META
- Trend direction (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA) plus momentum (MACD, MACD Signal, RSI) give you a multi-timeframe flavor for trend confirmation and early momentum shifts.
- Volatility context (boll middle and ATR) helps assess breakout risk and appropriate stop placement, crucial for a stock with significant move potential around earnings or AI-related headlines.
- The combination avoids redundancy (e.g., we’re not stacking RSI with Stochastic RSI) while giving a well-rounded view: trend, momentum, volatility, and risk guidance.

Note on the current data status
- The data retrieval step failed due to a FileNotFoundError. I can retry immediately. If you’d like, I’ll re-run get_YFin_data for META (2024-10-13 to 2025-10-13) and fetch the 8 indicators listed above, then deliver a fully data-driven, granular trend report with current values, signals, and actionable takeaways.

Proposed trading-contextual interpretation plan (once data is available)
- Trend filter: If price is above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, and price is above the 10 EMA, expect bullish impulse; look for MACD above signal and RSI rising toward overbought (but not extreme) as confirmation.
- Momentum checks: If MACD is crossing above its signal and RSI is trending upward from the 40-60 zone, this supports continuation in a bullish setup.
- Volatility cues: A rising ATR paired with price moving toward or beyond the Bollinger upper band (boll_ub) can indicate breakout strength and higher risk; use this with tighter stop logic or smaller sizing.
- Reversion/defense signals: If price treads below the 50/200 SMAs with MACD turning negative and RSI fading toward oversold regions, prepare for potential pullbacks or a defensive stance. Bollinger bands can help distinguish consolidation from genuine trend reversals.
- Risk management: Use ATR-adjusted stop distances; consider VWMA for volume-confirmed entries if you want a volume-filtered momentum signal (I can include VWMA in a follow-up if you want it added).

What I will deliver once data is retrieved
- A detailed, data-driven trend report for META on the requested date window, including:
  - Current values for the 8 indicators.
  - Interpretation of each indicator in the context of META's price action.
  - Synthesis of signals into a cohesive view (bullish, bearish, or range).
  - Specific trade ideas or alerts based on the integrated view (e.g., entry/exit zones, risk management notes).
  - A concise Markdown table at the end summarizing key points.

Markdown table: Key indicators, what they measure, and how to interpret for META
- Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for META
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend level; dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests bullish medium-term trend; bounce/breaks near 50SMA indicate trend strength
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA signals long-term uptrend; crossing below could indicate a major trend shift
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above 10EMA signals short-term bullish momentum; price below may indicate pullback or choppiness
- macd | Momentum momentum (MACD line) | MACD above signal indicates bullish momentum; crossing below may signal a shift to bearish momentum
- macds | MACD signal line | Confirms MACD cross signals; stronger confirmation when both MACD and MACDS move in the same direction
- rsi | Relative strength; momentum/overbought-oversold | RSI rising toward 70+ suggests potential overbought risk; falling below 30 indicates oversold risk
- boll | Bollinger Middle (20-SMA) as volatility baseline | Price relative to the middle band shows consolidation vs. expansion; price touching/pressing upper band hints at bullish breakout risk
- atr | True range-based volatility | Higher ATR implies higher volatility and wider stop zones; used to set risk controls and position sizing

Next steps
- Please confirm: would you like me to retry the data fetch now to produce the full data-driven report with actual numbers for META? If yes, I’ll run the data pull again and deliver the complete, quantitative trend analysis immediately after. If you prefer, I can proceed with the qualitative plan and indicators now and fill in the numbers once data is retrieved.
