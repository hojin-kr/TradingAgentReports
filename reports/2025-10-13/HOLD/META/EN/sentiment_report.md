I attempted to pull the Reddit sentiment data for META across the requested dates, but the tool call(s) returned a FileNotFoundError. In short, the data fetch from the Reddit sentiment source is currently failing in this session. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

Options to continue
- Option A: Retry now and in the next message I’ll attempt to fetch META sentiment data for 2025-10-13 to 2025-10-07 again (in parallel if possible) and then produce the full week-long sentiment analysis plus news context.
- Option B: Switch to a qualitative, source-agnostic analysis using other publicly available signals (e.g., recent META earnings/news headlines, regulatory/t policy context, product/AI updates) and outline implications for traders. I will clearly label where data is inferred vs. sourced.

What I can deliver right now (without the Reddit data)
- A structured report outline with the methodology and the implications for traders.
- A placeholder for the weekly sentiment synthesis that I’ll fill in once the data source is available.
- A Markdown table skeleton at the end to organize key points.

Proposed report structure (META, past week)
1) Executive snapshot
- Quick read on sentiment trend (overall positive, neutral, or negative) and any notable deviations day-by-day.
- High-level price/volume context if available (intraday moves around notable headlines).

2) Daily sentiment and headlines (conceptual)
- For each day in the past week, summarize: sentiment direction, notable Reddit threads/topics, and any headline catalysts.
- Note any divergences between sentiment signals and price movement.

3) Key drivers and catalysts
- Product/AI updates (e.g., platform changes, new features, ad tech developments).
- Regulatory, privacy, or competitive environment signals.
- Financial signals (advertising demand, guidance updates, earnings chatter).
- Macro factors that could be affecting risk sentiment.

4) News highlights (past 7 days)
- Short, direct summaries of the most impactful META news items (earnings, strategic moves, partnerships, regulatory actions, etc.).
- How those headlines typically influence sentiment and potential price reaction.

5) Sentiment metrics and risk lens (what traders would watch)
- Sentiment momentum (accumulation/decay patterns).
- Volatility/variance in daily sentiment readings.
- Correlation checks between sentiment shifts and intraday price moves.

6) Implications for trading decisions
- Short-term vs. longer-term implications based on the combined signal set.
- Potential risk factors and hedging ideas tied to the week’s sentiment and news.

7) Takeaways and cautions
- Actionable takeaways for traders, with caveats about data limitations and sources.

What would you like to do?
- Reply with "Retry" to have me attempt the Reddit data fetch again (I’ll run the data pulls for the dates you requested as soon as the tool is available).
- Or reply with "Qualitative" to proceed with a structured qualitative analysis using other sources and fill in the table as we go.

If you prefer, I can start by drafting the detailed qualitative analysis now and leave placeholders for the Reddit-derived sentiment once the tool is functional again.
