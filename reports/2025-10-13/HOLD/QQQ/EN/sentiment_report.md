I hit a tool error fetching Reddit data for QQQ on 2025-10-13 (FileNotFoundError). I tried twice. I can retry now, or pivot to a broader analysis that doesn’t rely on that specific data source.

What would you like to do?
- Option 1: Retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll attempt again immediately and then proceed with a full, Reddit-inclusive sentiment and news report).
- Option 2: Proceed with a comprehensive sentiment/news analysis using alternate data sources (e.g., general market news, ETF/tech sector headlines, macro catalysts, and price action) and clearly label any sentiment data as not Reddit-derived until the Reddit data is available.
- Option 3: A hybrid approach: I’ll fetch Reddit data as soon as the tool becomes available, but I’ll start with a robust qualitative report based on other sources in the meantime.

If you want me to proceed with Option 2 or 3, I’ll deliver a long-form analysis tailored for traders, including:
- Daily sentiment framework (qualitative) and key drivers for the past week
- News flow overview (tech and macro catalysts impacting QQQ, earnings cadence, regulatory events)
- Price action context (intraday moves, support/resistance levels, correlation to NASDAQ/tech indices)
- Megacap exposure sensitivity (how components like MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN etc. influence QQQ during the period)
- Risk factors and scenarios (bull vs. bear catalysts, liquidity considerations)
- Trade implications and scenarios (short-term swing ideas, hedging angles)
- A concise executive summary for quick decision-making

Also, I will append a Markdown table at the end organizing key points, once I have the data.

Please tell me which path you prefer (Retry now, or proceed with alternate sources). If you want, I can also proceed with Option 2 immediately and clearly annotate where Reddit data is missing.
