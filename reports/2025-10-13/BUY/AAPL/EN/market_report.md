I attempted to fetch the data for AAPL, but the data retrieval service returned a FileNotFoundError. This means I can’t access the actual price/indicator values right now. I can still lay out a solid set of indicators to monitor and explain how they would inform trading decisions once data is available. I can retry fetching data on your confirmation, or proceed with the plan below and generate the actual signals as soon as the data tool is accessible.

Recommended 8 indicators for AAPL (diverse, non-redundant, and complementary)

- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average (medium-term trend).
  - How to use: Use as a trend filter and support/resistance level. Price trading above 50SMA generally indicates a bullish tilt; a cross below can warn of a potential shift.
  - Why it’s useful: Helps align trades with the intermediate trend and filter out noisy signals in choppiness.

- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average (long-term trend).
  - How to use: Confirms the dominant market regime. Watch for golden cross (50SMA crossing above 200SMA) for bullish bias, or death cross for bearish bias.
  - Why it’s useful: Provides strategic context for entries/exits and risk tolerance against longer-term trends.

- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average (short-term momentum).
  - How to use: Capture quick momentum shifts. Signals include price crossing the 10 EMA or the 10 EMA slope turning up/down.
  - Why it’s useful: Responds faster than the SMAs, helping identify early momentum changes in a fast-moving stock like AAPL.

- macd
  - What it measures: MACD line (difference between two EMAs) and overall momentum.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossovers, divergences with price, and histogram changes to confirm trend strength.
  - Why it’s useful: Provides a clear momentum-based trigger in both uptrends and downtrends.

- macds
  - What it measures: MACD Signal (the EMA of MACD line).
  - How to use: Use crossovers of MACD with MACDS as trade signals; helps reduce false signals when paired with price action.
  - Why it’s useful: Adds a smoothing layer to MACD signals for more reliable entries/exits.

- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD Histogram (difference between MACD line and MACDS).
  - How to use: Gauge momentum strength and potential divergences; rising histogram supports the current move, shrinking/negative histogram warns of weakening momentum.
  - Why it’s useful: Visualizes momentum acceleration or deceleration, complementing MACD/macd signals.

- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index (momentum oscillator).
  - How to use: Monitor overbought/oversold territory (commonly 70/30) and watch for divergences with price as reversal signals.
  - Why it’s useful: Adds a momentum context and helps identify potential reversals when price trends reach extremes.

- atr
  - What it measures: Average True Range (volatility).
  - How to use: Inform risk management — set stop losses and determine position sizing based on current volatility.
  - Why it’s useful: Helps adapt risk controls to market conditions; higher ATR suggests wider stops, lower ATR suggests tighter stops.

Notes and caveats
- The MACD group (macd, macds, macdh) provides a comprehensive view of momentum via crossovers, signal smoothing, and momentum strength. While they are related, together they can offer more robust signals if used with price action and other indicators.
- RSI is a strong momentum tool, but in trending markets it can stay overbought or oversold for extended periods. Always confirm with trend direction (50SMA/200SMA) and MACD signals to avoid premature entries.
- ATR is reactive; use it for risk controls rather than pure entry signals. Combine with a stop strategy and position sizing rules.

Next steps
- I can retry retrieving data for AAPL and then generate an integrated indicator report using the 8 indicators above. Do you want me to:
  - Retry data retrieval now, or
  - Proceed with this plan and provide the indicator interpretations once data is available?

If you’d like, I can also swap in another indicator (e.g., vwma or bollinger components) in place of one of the above—just tell me your preferences.

Key points at a glance (table)

| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for AAPL | Why it’s useful |
|-----------|----------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | 50-day trend | Price above = bullish tilt; price below = risk of pullback; watch crossovers | Filters trend, identifies dynamic support/resistance |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | 200-day trend | Confirms regime; golden/death cross context | Long-term trend confirmation and strategic bias |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below; slope changes | Detects quick momentum shifts; helps timing |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMAs | Crosses and histogram growth signal strength | Clear momentum signals, trend changes |
| macds | MACD Signal | MACD smoothing | MACD vs MACDS cross as entry/exit trigger | Reduces false positives, adds reliability |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction signals momentum changes | Visual momentum acceleration/deceleration |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold momentum | >70/ <30 signals; watch for divergences | Reversal signals; complements trend indicators |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility | Set stops and sizing: higher ATR = wider stops | Risk management aligned with volatility |

If you want me to proceed, say “retry data fetch” and I’ll attempt to pull the data again and then generate a full indicator report with current readings.
