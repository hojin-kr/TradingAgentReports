It looks like the Reddit data tool failed:

- I attempted to fetch AAPL Reddit sentiment data for 2025-10-07 through 2025-10-13 in parallel, but all calls returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). I can retry the calls now or after a short delay, whichever you prefer.

What would you like me to do next?
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now (and then proceed with the full long-form report once the data comes in).
- Option B: Proceed with alternative sources (e.g., latest Apple news, press releases, public sentiment from other platforms) and draft the report now, updating Reddit sentiment as soon as the tool is available.
- Option C: Wait and then I’ll run the Reddit fetch and compile a combined report.

In the meantime, I can start outlining the long report and providing a structured framework, so you have something to review while we resolve the data tool issue. Here’s a suggested report structure and a placeholder table you can expect at the end:

Proposed report structure (without Reddit data yet)
- Executive summary: current state of sentiment, notable news, and likely near-term catalysts for AAPL.
- Social sentiment overview: overall tone (positive/negative/neutral), notable spikes, and potential drivers (product launches, earnings, regulatory news).
- Reddit sentiment deep-dive (pending): day-by-day sentiment swings, top upvoted themes, and any recurring concerns or hype.
- Company news and events (past week): summarize key headlines, press releases, product announcements, partnerships, regulatory updates.
- Contextual factors: macro tech sector sentiment, AI/semiconductor/news cycle, supply chain signals, consumer demand indicators.
- Implications for traders and investors:
  - Short-term catalysts and risks
  - Medium-term momentum signals
  - Key price action scenarios and risk factors
- Quantitative sentiment cues (if available): day-over-day sentiment delta, volume spikes, notable post counts.
- Risks and caveats: data limitations, potential biases in social sentiment.
- Conclusions and potential trading ideas (without a final buy/hold/sell call until data is complete).
- Appendix: data sources and methodology.

Proposed Markdown table (to be filled once data is available)
- Key Points per Day
- Daily Reddit Sentiment (if available)
- Major News/Event Impact
- Implied Momentum Signal (if calculable)
- Trader Implications (Short-term, Medium-term)
- Confidence/Gap Notes

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry now) or Option B (use alternative sources first), tell me which you prefer and I’ll move accordingly. Once Reddit data returns, I’ll integrate it into the full, detailed analysis and deliver the final long-form report.
