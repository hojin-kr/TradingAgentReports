I attempted to fetch the GOOGL data for 2024-10-13 to 2025-10-13, but the data retrieval service returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry right away or at a later time, or we can adjust the date range. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a solid indicator framework tailored for GOOGL that will give you complementary, non-redundant insights as soon as the data is available.

Selected indicators (up to 8) and why they’re suited for GOOGL
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why for GOOGL: Alphabet’s stock often trends in discernible cycles driven by earnings, AI news, and tech sector flow. 50 SMA helps confirm trend direction and filter noise when combined with faster signals.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and potential golden/death cross signals.
  - Why for GOOGL: Useful for strategic trend confirmation; helps assess whether price action is in an overarching uptrend or downtrend, which matters for risk management and posture.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - Purpose: Short-term momentum and potential entry/exit timing.
  - Why for GOOGL: Captures quicker shifts in momentum around earnings reports, product launches, or market sentiment, and pairs well with the slower SMAs for cross-checks.
- macd (MACD)
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals via EMA differences.
  - Why for GOOGL: Helps identify shifts from accumulation to distribution phases or vice versa; useful in both trending and mildly range-bound environments when combined with other filters.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Purpose: Smoothing crossover signals for MACD.
  - Why for GOOGL: Reduces false positives by requiring MACD line crossovers with the signal line to validate momentum changes.
- rsi (Momentum)
  - Purpose: Overbought/oversold conditions and momentum strength.
  - Why for GOOGL: RSI helps flag potential reversals during extended uptrends or downtrends; good to use with trend context to avoid whipsaw in strong directional moves.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - Purpose: Dynamic price benchmark (20-period SMA) and basis for band analysis.
  - Why for GOOGL: When used with bands, it helps identify breakout zones or reversals around the middle line and bands, especially around earnings or major announcements.
- atr (Volatility)
  - Purpose: Volatility-based risk management and position sizing.
  - Why for GOOGL: Useful to adapt stop levels and risk per trade to changing market volatility, which is important for high-growth tech names whose volatility may expand around catalysts.

What I will deliver once data is retried successfully
- A detailed trend report that examines:
  - Price position relative to 50 SMA and 200 SMA to gauge trend direction and potential cross signals.
  - The 10 EMA in relation to price and the longer SMAs to assess short-term momentum vs. longer-term trend.
  - MACD and MACD Signal crossovers, plus MACD histogram behavior to quantify momentum strength and potential divergences.
  - RSI readings with awareness of any divergence against price action and whether momentum is extreme or reverting.
  - Bollinger Middle relationship to price and whether price is touching or expanding beyond the bands to infer volatility-driven breakouts or reversals.
  - ATR-driven context for risk management and stop placement, adjusting for current volatility regime.
- A concise, trader-friendly interpretation that highlights:
  - Whether the setup is trending, consolidating, or volatile.
  - Potential entry/exit levels with respect to moving averages and Bollinger bands.
  - Risk controls based on ATR and current volatility.

Proposed output structure (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: Key trend direction, momentum, and volatility stance.
- Indicator-by-indicator notes: How each indicator is signaling, including any confluence or divergence.
- Trade considerations: Potential entry/exit points, stop placement, and position sizing guidance informed by ATR.
- Risk assessment: Volatility regime and how it impacts risk management.

Markdown table: key indicators and roles
| Indicator | Category | Purpose | How to interpret signals (short guidance) |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50 SMA suggests uptrend; cross of price above/below can signal trend change when aligned with other signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above 200 SMA = bullish bias; price below signals potential longer-term weakness; watch for golden/death cross with 50 SMA for confirmation |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price above 10 EMA indicates bullish near-term momentum; pullbacks to 10 EMA can offer entry points in uptrends |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend changes | MACD line crossing above/below its signal line indicates momentum shifts; use with price/MA context to avoid false signals |
| macds | MACD Signal | Signal line for MACD | Crossovers with MACD line provide more robust momentum signals; confirm with price action and other indicators |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold and momentum strength | RSI above 70 may indicate overbought; below 30 may indicate oversold; beware in strong trends where RSI can stay extended |
| boll | Bollinger Middle | Baseline price benchmark and context for breakouts | Price near/below middle line with bands widening/narrowing helps gauge breakout risk and volatility context |
| atr | Volatility | Stop placement and risk management | Rising ATR implies higher volatility and larger stop distances; use to size positions appropriately |

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now or at a time you prefer. If you’d like, I’ll reattempt immediately and then generate the full, nuanced trend report with the 8 indicators above, plus the Markdown table, once I have the data.
- If you prefer a different date range or scope (e.g., intraday data, different interval), tell me and I’ll adjust.
