Assessment:
- Recommendation: Buy Alphabet (GOOGL) with a disciplined, phased entry and clear risk controls.

Why this fits:
- Bull case alignment: AI-driven monetization across ads, YouTube, and Cloud provides multi‑pillar growth over several years. Alphabet’s free cash flow supports buybacks and selective investment, reinforcing long‑term earnings visibility.
- Risk balance: Near‑term macro sensitivity, regulatory headwinds, and cloud margin pressure are recognized, but the long‑term trajectory remains favorable if the staged entry and risk controls are followed.
- Risk controls are actionable: ATR-based stops, protective hedges (e.g., collar structure where appropriate), modest initial sizing, and a strict review cadence reduce downside while preserving upside.

Execution plan (phased entry):
- Tranche 1: Deploy 25–40% of the planned position on a pullback to the 50/200‑day crossover region or a clearly defined support zone with bullish confirmations.
- Tranche 2: Add 30–40% if price holds above support and momentum is positive (MACD rising, RSI above 50, price above mid‑MA band).
- Tranche 3: If sustained upside momentum appears (new highs, MACD bullish cross, clear breakout on volume), deploy the remaining 20–30%.

Risk management:
- Use volatility‑adjusted stops (ATR-based) with a floor and a trailing stop to lock in gains.
- Consider a protective hedge (e.g., a collar with short puts/long calls or costless protection when IV is elevated around key events).
- Start with modest position sizing (1–2% of portfolio) and scale to 3–5% if confirming signals persist.
- Maintain data hygiene and a quarterly refresh of catalysts, momentum signals, and sentiment indicators.

Monitoring and review:
- Track the eight indicators you favor and require a confluence of signals before increasing exposure on later tranches.
- Prepare for two scenarios: base (measured AI monetization progress) and upside (accelerated monetization and margin improvement). Reassess quarterly; tighten risk if bear thesis dominates or regulatory/regulatory risk accelerates.

Final verdict:
- Yes, Buy with a staged, risk-controlled approach as outlined.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
