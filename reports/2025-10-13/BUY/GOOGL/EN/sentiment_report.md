Sorry about that — the Reddit data fetch for GOOGL (GOOGL) failed with a FileNotFoundError. I can retry pulling Reddit sentiment now, or, if you prefer, I can proceed with a detailed framework and interim analysis using the data I can gather from other sources once the Reddit tool is available again.

Here’s how I propose to proceed, given the current limitation:

What I can do now (framework-driven, no live Reddit data yet)
- Executive snapshot
  - High-level sentiment direction for GOOGL over the past week (bullish/bearish/mixed) and the main catalysts driving sentiment.
  - Key risk and opportunity signals that traders should watch this week.
- Social sentiment framework (Reddit-focused)
  - Daily sentiment breakdown (within the past 7 days) and notable themes per day (e.g., AI/ads/Regulatory concerns/Cloud competition).
  - Top threads by engagement (volume, upvotes) and the dominant takeaways (bullish vs bearish) without quoting verbatim.
  - Thematically recurring concerns or bullish catalysts (e.g., earnings expectations, AI product updates, Chrome/Android ecosystem topics, antitrust/regulatory chatter).
- Public news roundup (recent company news)
  - Summary of major Alphabet/GOOGL news items from the past week (earnings, product launches, regulatory developments, partnerships, leadership changes).
  - Any notable market impact signals (headline-driven moves, sentiment shifts after announcements).
- Market context
  - Macro and tech sector context that could color sentiment around large-cap tech names like GOOGL (AI hype, cloud demand, ad market dynamics, regulatory tone).
- Trading implications for traders
  - Short- to medium-term sentiment-based read on potential price drivers.
  - Risk factors and hedging ideas that could align with the observed sentiment (e.g., directionality vs. volatility bets).
- Quantitative signals (qualitative until data is available)
  - Conceptual sentiment score trajectory, mood swings, and divergence vs. price action to watch for potential reversals.
- Limitations
  - Note that this section will be fully populated with concrete Reddit data once the data fetch succeeds.

What I can do immediately
- If you want me to retry the Reddit data pull now, say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt again and then produce a full, data-backed report.
- Or, if you’d rather proceed with the framework right away, I can draft a complete long-form report structure with hypothetical placeholders and clearly labeled sections, then fill in the actual Reddit findings as soon as the tool succeeds.

If you’d like, I can also prepare a Makrdown table skeleton that will be used at the end of the final report to organize key points. Here’s a ready-to-fill template you can reference:

- Date range covered: Past 7 days
- Key sentiment trend: Bullish / Bearish / Mixed
- Top Reddit themes: (e.g., AI product updates, cloud growth, ad market resilience/weakness, regulatory chatter)
- Most-engaged threads: (topic + takeaway sentiment)
- Major news items: (headline + impact)
- Price/macro context: (price action around the week, notable moves)
- Trading implications: (entry/exit/hedge ideas)
- Risks: (list of potential headwinds)
- Opportunities: (list of potential catalysts)

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull now, or should I proceed with the framework and draft the full report structure in the meantime?
