Verdict: Buy (with disciplined risk controls and staged exposure)

Rationale
- Multi-year AI compute tailwind: OpenAI collaboration and multi-GW plans support a durable growth trajectory beyond a single cycle.
- Platform moat: CUDA/software ecosystem creates switching costs and helps sustain margins and pricing power.
- Favorable setup, tempered by risk: Valuation and macro/regulatory headwinds warrant careful sizing and risk management.

Execution plan (concise)
- Positioning: Start NVDA with 2-3% of total portfolio; plan to scale to 5-7% over 3-6 months if bullish signals persist.
- Entry criteria (multi-signal bull alignment):
  - Price above 50-day and 200-day moving averages; 50-day slope upwards.
  - Short-term momentum positive: 10-day EMA > 20-day EMA; MACD positive with expanding histogram.
  - RSI trending higher but not overbought; ATR indicating room for continued moves.
  - Pullback entry acceptable near 50-day SMA or 10-day EMA with positive signals intact.
- Risk controls:
  - Fixed risk per trade: ~0.5-1% of portfolio per NVDA lot, adjusted for volatility.
  - Stop placement: hard stop if price closes below the 200-day SMA on high volume OR if MACD turns negative with price structure breaks.
  - Use trailing stops to lock in gains as the trend advances.
- Downside protection:
  - Consider protective puts or a collar (long NVDA, long puts or long-dated OTM puts; capped upside via short calls) in early stages or for larger allocations.
- Catalysts and monitoring:
  - Track OpenAI milestones, 10 GW build progress, regulatory/export-headline risk.
  - Monitor data-center demand signals, ASP trends, and CUDA ecosystem momentum post-earnings.
- Review cadence:
  - Monthly thesis review; trigger a near-term reassessment after major AI headlines or earnings. Be ready to trim/exit if momentum deteriorates or risk signals trigger.

Notes on risk and scenarios
- Bear-case risk: Valuation multiple compression if growth signals falter or policy/regulatory headwinds intensify; competitive pressure from AMD/Intel; macro shocks.
- Bull-case risk: Accelerated AI adoption and stronger OpenAI/capex programs reinforcing demand; expansion of CUDA ecosystem maintains premium margins.
