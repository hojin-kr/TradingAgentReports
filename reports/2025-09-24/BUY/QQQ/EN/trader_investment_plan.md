Decision: Buy QQQ with disciplined risk controls and hedging.

Rationale
- The plan’s thesis remains constructive: price sits above meaningful trend lines, MACD is supportive, histogram momentum is intact, and RSI isn’t in overbought territory. This aligns with a continuation of the uptrend, especially if AI/cloud/infra growth remains durable and macro tailwinds ease.
- Bear theses are real (concentration risk, premium multiples, breadth concerns, macro/regulatory headwinds). The strategy directly addresses them with hedges and regime-change rules, preserving upside while limiting downside.

Execution framework (how to implement)

1) Core exposure
- Establish a core long position in QQQ now, sized to fit your risk budget.
- Plan incremental add-ons on disciplined pullbacks near key trend levels, specifically:
  - Near the 50-day SMA and/or 10-period EMA
  - With MACD still positive and RSI not in overbought territory
- Avoid chasing; scale in to a target core exposure gradually as these criteria remain in place.

2) Risk controls and hedging
- Protective hedges to cap downside:
  - Buy protective puts on QQQ with a horizon of 1–3 quarters (ATM to slightly OTM) or implement a collar (long QQQ, long puts, short calls at a higher strike) to reduce cost while preserving some upside.
  - Alternatively, hedge with long-dated puts on top megacaps (NVDA/MSFT) if you prefer name-specific hedges.
- Hedge sizing: allocate a modest portion of risk capital to hedges (e.g., 5–15% of the core exposure’s notional, adjustable to risk tolerance and premium costs).

3) Stop and regime-change rules
- If price breaks below the 50SMA with MACD turning negative, tighten stops or reduce exposure.
- If price breaks and sustains below the 200SMA, reassess the core exposure and consider trimming or hedging intensification.
- Use trailing stops or a risk-off signal if breadth deteriorates (e.g., lack of participation beyond mega-caps).

4) Monitoring and signals
- Monitor daily/near-daily indicators:
  - MACD status (positive/negative shift, histogram changes)
  - Price relative to 50SMA and 200SMA
  - RSI levels and any divergence
  - Breadth signals (participation breadth beyond mega-caps)
  - Macro updates on rates/policy stance
- Cross-check with at least one alternate data source or signal to avoid overreliance on a single framework.

5) Position sizing and sequencing
- Start with a moderate core allocation now.
- Schedule staged add-ons over the next 4–8 weeks on meeting entry criteria (pullbacks + MACD confirmation).
- Reserve a portion of capital for hedges and for potential stop-trigger-driven adjustments.

6) Contingencies and review
- If macro shocks or breadth weaknesses intensify, be prepared to reduce core exposure or intensify hedging even if the technical setup remains favorable.
- Regularly compare outcomes with the plan’s assumptions; adjust regime-change rules and hedge levels based on realized volatility and observed breadth.

Notes on tailoring (if you want numbers)
- I can tailor exact put strikes, expirations, and position sizes to your portfolio size, risk tolerance, and tax/intended horizon.
- I can also map out a timestamped signal map with the 8 indicators you mentioned, plus a contingency matrix for rapid macro shifts.

Bottom line
- The recommended stance is Buy, but with discipline: a core long exposure backed by protective hedges, clear entry on pullbacks with confirmatory signals, and defined regime-change rules to cap downside and preserve upside participation.
