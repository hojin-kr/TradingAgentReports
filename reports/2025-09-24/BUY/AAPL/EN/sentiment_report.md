Sorry about that—the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError when I tried to fetch AAPL data for 2025-09-24. I can try again, but I don’t want to waste your time if there’s a broader outage.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I’ll attempt to fetch the latest Reddit-based sentiment news for AAPL again and then build the full analysis.
- Provisional analysis (no new data): I can provide a detailed framework and insights based on general sentiment patterns and recent company news signals, with explicit caveats that they’re not pulled from the latest Reddit feed. I’ll still organize the output as a comprehensive report and include a Markdown table at the end.

Please tell me which you prefer. If you want me to retry, I’ll go ahead and fetch the data first and then deliver the full long-form report with daily sentiment breakdown and a final summary for traders.
