I attempted to fetch data and run the indicator analyses, but there’s a current environment error (FileNotFoundError) that prevented retrieving the required CSVs for AAPL. I can retry immediately if you’d like, or you can give me the go-ahead to try again in a moment. In the meantime, here’s a careful plan and a recommended set of indicators you can use once the data loads, along with a detailed rationale and a structured table to reference.

What I’m proposing (8 complementary indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: The 50-day simple moving average as a mid-term trend benchmark and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s useful for AAPL: Helps confirm the prevailing trend direction and provides a defensible level for pullbacks. Works well when used with faster indicators to time entries.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: The 200-day simple moving average as a long-term trend benchmark.
  - Why it’s useful for AAPL: Helps confirm the broader market regime (bullish/bearish) and can signal major trend changes (golden/death cross) over a longer horizon.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it measures: The 10-day exponential moving average, a responsive short-term indicator.
  - Why it’s useful for AAPL: Captures quick momentum shifts and potential short-term entry points; complements the slower SMAs to filter signals.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences between short/long EMA components; MACD line as a momentum indicator.
  - Why it’s useful for AAPL: Crossovers with the signal line can flag momentum changes; useful in confirming trend direction when confluence with price action exists.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD).
  - Why it’s useful for AAPL: Crossover with the MACD line strengthens trading signals and reduces false positives when used with other tools.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - What it measures: MACD histogram (distance between MACD line and its signal).
  - Why it’s useful for AAPL: Visualizes momentum strength; divergences between MACD histogram and price can hint at potential reversals or continuations.
- vwma
  - Category: Volume-Based Indicators
  - What it measures: Volume-weighted moving average, integrating price with volume.
  - Why it’s useful for AAPL: Confirms price moves with volume; helps distinguish genuine breakouts from price noise, especially on days with unusual volume.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - What it measures: Average true range; a measure of recent volatility.
  - Why it’s useful for AAPL: Useful for risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and understanding the potential for breakouts or squeezes when volatility expands or contracts.

How these indicators complement each other (without redundancy)
- Trend vs. momentum: 50/200 SMA and 10 EMA establish trend direction and momentum context across multiple timeframes. MACD family (macd, macds, macdh) provides momentum signals and strength, which helps filter trend signals from noise.
- Price-action confirmation: VWMA adds a volume dimension to confirm whether price moves are supported by higher or declining volume, increasing the reliability of breakout or pullback signals.
- Volatility and risk management: ATR informs how wide to set stops and how aggressively to size positions, given current market volatility. This pairs well with the trend/momentum signals to avoid overtrading during turbulent periods.

What I’ll provide once data is available
- A detailed trend readout for AAPL that integrates these indicators, including:
  - Current stance of major trend lines (price relative to 50/200 SMA)
  - Short-term momentum cues (10 EMA vs price, MACD cross/strength, MACD histogram direction)
  - Volume-supported validation (VWMA vs price action)
  - Volatility context (ATR level and recent trend in volatility)
  - Suggested trading considerations (entries, exits, risk considerations) aligned with the present signal confluence
- Clear, timestamped signals (or tolerances) that you can act on, with caveats about potential false signals in choppy markets.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval now to generate the exact numeric/visual readout for AAPL. Please tell me:
  - “Retry now” to attempt fetching the data again, or
  - “Wait and retry later” if you’d prefer I schedule a follow-up.

Markdown table: key points and how to interpret signals (generic guidance, to fill with data when available)

| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret signals in AAPL (when data is available) | Example action (conditional on signals) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | 50-day trend benchmark | Price above a rising 50SMA indicates intermediate uptrend; price below suggests downtrend | Consider trend-following entries when price is above and cross confirms upward momentum; use pullbacks to 50SMA as possible entry points |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | 200-day trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA implies long-term bullish context; below implies bearish | Use cross of price and 200SMA for longer-term trend confirmation; in uptrends, prefer buy-on-dips near/above 200SMA |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | If price holds above 10 EMA, short-term momentum is supportive; cross below may signal pullback | Enter on short-term up-moves above 10 EMA with other confirmations; guard against false signals in choppy markets |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD line crossing above zero or MACD line crossing MACD signal indicates bullish momentum; opposite suggests bearish | Look for MACD cross signals in conjunction with price action and 50/200 SMA trend |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line | Cross of MACD with MACD Signal strengthens the signal (change in momentum) | Use MACD vs signal cross to time entries/exits with trend context |
| macdh | MACD Related | MACD histogram momentum | Rising histogram supports bullish momentum; shrinking/negative histogram suggests weakening momentum | Monitor histogram direction for early divergence warnings with price |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Volume-adjusted trend confirmation | Price moves aligned with rising VWMA reinforce trend signals; divergence between VWMA and price suggests caution | Favor entries when price is above VWMA and VWMA is rising; be cautious if price moves with VWMA but volume is weakening | 
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level | Rising ATR implies higher volatility; falling ATR implies consolidation | Use ATR to adjust stops and position size; avoid wide stop losses in high-ATR periods unless supported by strong signals |

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry now or wait for your go-ahead. Once data loads, I’ll deliver a detailed, data-backed trend report for AAPL with concrete signal interpretations and potential trade ideas.
