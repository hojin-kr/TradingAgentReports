I’m running into a tool access issue right now (FileNotFoundError) when trying to retrieve data for GOOGL. This prevents me from pulling insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the SimFin financial statements at the moment.

I can proceed in two ways, depending on your preference:

Option A – Retry now to generate the full fundamental report
- I’ll attempt to fetch:
  - Finnhub insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Finnhub insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - SimFin balance sheet (quarterly)
  - SimFin income statement (quarterly)
  - SimFin cash flow (quarterly)
- If successful, I’ll deliver a comprehensive, trader-focused report with detailed insights and a Markdown table at the end.

Option B – Provide a qualitative, prepated framework now
- I’ll give you:
  - A structured fundamentals overview for Alphabet (GOOGL) based on typical near-term drivers (profitability, growth catalysts, balance sheet strength, capital allocation, and risk factors) without the latest numeric figures.
  - A checklist of the exact data points you’d typically want to see from insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the three financial statements.
  - A Markdown table skeleton you can fill in once the data tools are accessible.

Please tell me which option you’d prefer, or if you’d like me to retry immediately and see if the data tools come back online.
