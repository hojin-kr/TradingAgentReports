Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the Reddit sentiment data for GOOGL across the requested dates (2025-09-24 and surrounding days) using the Reddit stock-info tool, but the tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a backend/tool environment issue rather than an issue with the request. I can’t retrieve the live Reddit sentiment data right now. Here are the options and an interim plan to keep us moving:

What I can do right now
- Provide a structured framework for the analysis you’re asking for, so once the Reddit data tool is restored I can fill in the exact figures and write a detailed, data-backed report.
- Outline how I would aggregate and interpret sentiment from Reddit along with recent company news, plus implications for traders.
- If you’d like, I can switch to alternative sentiment sources (e.g., public social media bursts or other sentiment feeds you authorize) and still deliver a thorough, actionable report. I don’t currently have another tool in this session to fetch those sources automatically, but I can describe how I’d do it and what signals to look for.

 interim plan options
- Retry automatically: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again in a few minutes and then compile the full report with the actual daily sentiment scores, volumes, and themes.
- Use alternative data sources: If you’re okay with me pulling from other channels you approve (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, or major finance news sentiment), I can assemble a combined sentiment view and provide a traders-oriented interpretation.
- Deliver now with a placeholder scaffold: I can provide a comprehensive, data-ready report template and a filled-in interpretation framework, clearly labeled as contingent on Reddit data once available. This lets you review the methodology and structure right away.

Proposed structure for the full report (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot
  - High-level sentiment trend across the past week (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Key catalysts in that window (AI announcements, regulatory news, earnings hints, major product updates)
  - Immediate implications for Google (GOOGL) stock behavior and risk factors
- Data-driven sentiment analysis
  - Daily Reddit sentiment scores by date, with volume
  - Top themes driving sentiment changes (e.g., AI initiatives, cloud/ads news, regulatory concerns)
  - Cross-date sentiment momentum (e.g., improving sentiment after a specific post or news item)
- News comparison
  - Summary of recent Alphabet news headlines within the period
  - Alignment or divergence between social sentiment and headline news
  - Any notable events that caused sentiment spikes
- Price and market microstructure context
  - Price action around sentiment shifts (intraday vs. closing)
  - Any notable correlations with option activity or implied volatility (if data available)
- Trader implications and scenarios
  - When sentiment aligns with price moves vs. when it diverges
  - Potential catalysts that could validate or counter current sentiment
  - Quick-hit trade ideas with risk considerations (e.g., if sentiment remains positive but price weakens, look for breakout signals; if sentiment turns negative on a regulatory headline, consider hedging signals)
- Risks and data gaps
  - Potential biases in Reddit data (subset of retail investors, forum-specific dynamics)
  - Data delays, changes in posting velocity, or moderation effects
  - Missing dates or low-volume days that should be interpreted with caution
- Appendix
  - Data sources and methodology
  - Glossary of sentiment metrics
  - Any caveats about cross-source synthesis

Proposed Markdown table (to fill after data is available)
- I’ll append this at the end of the final report with actual numbers. For now, here’s the table structure you’ll see populated:

Next steps
- Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
  1) I retry the Reddit data pull automatically and will craft the full report as soon as I have the data.
  2) I switch to an alternate sentiment data source you approve and deliver a combined sentiment + news report.
  3) I provide a detailed qualitative framework now (as above) and await data retrieval to populate the numbers.

If you’d like me to retry immediately, I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull for GOOGL again and proceed with the full, data-backed report as soon as it returns.
