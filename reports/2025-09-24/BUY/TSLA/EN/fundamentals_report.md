I attempted to pull the TSLA fundamentals data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data environment is currently misconfigured or temporarily unavailable for these tools. I can retry now, or switch to a qualitative analysis based on publicly known information up to 2024-2025 and clearly label it as not data-derived. Here are two options:

Options
- Option A: Retry data pull now (recommended). I’ll re-issue the tool calls as soon as the service is back, then compile a full, data-driven fundamentals report.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative/contextual analysis in the meantime, clearly noting that data figures are not retrieved, and provide a structured template for you to fill in when data arrives.

What I can deliver now (without fresh data)
- A structured fundamentals report skeleton for TSLA, with sections you can expect to see once data is available.
- A Markdown table at the end that summarizes key points and indicates data status (Pending) until the data fetch succeeds.
- Clear next steps and data refresh plan.

Next steps
- Option A (recommended): I retry the data fetch now. If it succeeds, I’ll produce a full, data-driven TSLA fundamentals report with the detailed figures and a filled-in Markdown table.
- Option B: If you prefer not to wait, I can deliver a qualitative analysis right away (with caveats about the missing data) and then update the report when data is available.

Please tell me which option you’d like:
- Retry data pull now (Option A)
- Proceed with qualitative analysis now (Option B)

If you want me to retry, I’ll run the data fetch again and return with a complete, data-backed report as soon as the tools respond.
