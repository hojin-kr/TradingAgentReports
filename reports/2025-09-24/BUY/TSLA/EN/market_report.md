Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch TSLA data (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-24) via get_YFin_data, but I hit a backend tool error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). This seems to be an environment issue with the data file rather than your request. I can retry, but in the meantime here’s how I’d proceed and what I’ll deliver once the data is accessible.

What I can do right now
- Prepare a concise, multi-indicator framework for TSLA that will give complementary insights once the data fetch issue is resolved.
- Use up to 8 indicators that cover trend, momentum, and volatility without redundancy.
- Deliver a very detailed, nuanced report of TSLA’s state once I have the data, including practical takeaways for entries, risk management, and key levels.

Recommended indicators to use (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Use for trend direction and to confirm other signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; confirms major regime direction and potential golden/death cross signals.
- close_10_ema: 10-period EMA. Captures short-term momentum and quick shifts; good for timely entries when used with longer-term filters.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum signal; crossovers with the MACD line signal potential trend changes; useful when combined with trend context.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoother signal line; crossovers with MACD line strengthen trade signals and reduce noise.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength and divergence visualization; helps gauge acceleration or weakening momentum.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum indicator showing overbought/oversold conditions; useful for reversal cues, especially in conjunction with trend direction.
- atr: ATR. Volatility measure to inform risk management and position sizing; helps set buffers/stop levels in dynamic markets.

Why this set is suitable for TSLA
- TSLA tends to show strong trend phases with sharp moves; having both 50/200 SMA gives a clear view of the macro trend, while 10 EMA catches shorter-term swings.
- MACD family (macd, macds, macdh) provides robust momentum signals and helps verify trend signals with convergence/divergence patterns.
- RSI adds a momentum-novelty check for potential reversals when the stock is overextended, especially in a high-volatility name like TSLA.
- ATR complements the set by guiding risk controls in volatile periods and helping scale stops to market noise levels.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, granular analysis of TSLA’s price action over the requested window, including:
  - Trend assessment (MA crossovers, price vs. MA relations)
  - Momentum signals (MACD and RSI interpretations with divergences)
  - Volatility context (ATR-driven risk levels and stop thresholds)
  - Key support/resistance zones (derived from MAs, recent highs/lows)
  - Volume/flow context if VWMA or related data is available
  - Practical trading implications (entry/exit ideas, risk controls, and scenario planning)
- A concise, trader-ready narrative describing current bias (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) plus actionable takeaways.

What I need from you
- Shall I retry fetching TSLA data now (the data environment may be temporarily unavailable) or would you like me to try with a shorter date window or a different ticker/timeframe?
- If you’re flexible, I can proceed with a fallback approach using a shorter recent window (e.g., last 90 days) to at least produce an initial indicator readout and a ready-to-trade set of insights.

Note: As soon as the data fetch succeeds, I’ll generate the full report with the 8 indicators, provide precise readings, and append a Markdown table summarizing the key points.

Markdown table: Indicator plan summary (to be filled with actual data once available)
- Indicator | Category | What it tells you
- close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend confirmation
- close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum and quick shifts
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum trend changes via MACD line
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line crossovers for signal confirmation
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergence cues
- rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context and potential reversals
- atr | Volatility | Market volatility, stop-loss and risk sizing

If you’d like me to retry now, say “retry TSLA data,” and I’ll attempt another fetch and proceed with the full, detailed report as soon as data is retrieved.
