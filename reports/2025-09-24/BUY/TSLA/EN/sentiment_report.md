Sorry about that—the Reddit stock info tool is returning a FileNotFoundError right now, so I can’t fetch the TSLA Reddit sentiment data at the moment.

I can proceed in a few ways. Please tell me which you prefer:

- Option A: Retry now and then produce the full, long-form TSLA analysis (social sentiment + news) with a Markdown table at the end as soon as the data fetch succeeds.
- Option B: Generate a best-effort TSLA analysis using non-Reddit sources (e.g., general social sentiment and recent news headlines) and clearly label it as contingent on Reddit data being unavailable. I’ll still include a structured Markdown table.
- Option C: Pause and wait until the Reddit tool becomes available again, then run the complete analysis.

If you want Option A or B, I can start immediately and deliver the report with the Markdown table as soon as possible. Here’s what the final report will include (structured outline, so you know what to expect):

- Executive snapshot: current sentiment direction, catalysts, and risk signals for TSLA over the near term.
- Social sentiment overview: overall polarity, key themes (e.g., production, guidance, FSD, pricing), notable spikes, and day-by-day sentiment breakdown.
- News & event context: summary of the latest company-specific news, earnings signals, regulatory updates, and macro factors affecting TSLA.
- Channel-specific sentiment synthesis: how Twitter/X, YouTube, forums, and other public chatter are reacting to recent moves, with emphasis on any divergences from mainstream news.
- Price-action implications: how sentiment signals align or diverge from price action, and what that could imply for short- vs. long-term positioning.
- Risk factors and trade ideas: potential catalysts to watch, scenarios that would shift sentiment, and concise trade ideas (e.g., momentum plays, mean-reversion angles, risk management notes).
- Quantified takeaways: summarized sentiment metrics, notable volume changes, and any predicted inflection points.
- Market context: how TSLA stacks up against peers and sector-wide sentiment trends.

And I’ll end with a Markdown table organizing the key points for quick reference.

Tell me which option you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly. If you choose A (retry), I’ll attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately and then deliver the full report.
