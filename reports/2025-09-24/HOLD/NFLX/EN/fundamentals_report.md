I hit an environment error while trying to fetch NFLX data right now. The tool calls returned FileNotFoundError, so I can’t retrieve insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financials at the moment.

What you can do next:
- I can retry immediately if you’d like, or retry after a short wait.
- I can proceed with a qualitative, trader-focused fundamental framework for NFLX using publicly-known information up to 2024-06 (with clear caveats about not reflecting the past week data). This would lack the most recent insider activity and the latest quarterly figures.
- If you can provide the data (copy/paste or upload the results from the tools when they’re available), I can compile a complete, weekly-focused report with analysis and a finalized Markdown table.

Here is what the final report will include once data is available, plus the structure I’ll follow. This will help you gauge the kind of insights you’ll get and what to expect once the data retrieval succeeds:

Proposed report structure (to be filled with actual data):
- Company profile (NFLX)
  - Business model, segments (content licensing, streaming, ads, DVD if relevant historically)
  - Geography, subscriber mix, ARPU trends
- Financial overview (most recent period)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income
  - Cash flow from operations, capex, free cash flow
  - Balance sheet highlights (cash, debt, working capital)
- Income statement trends (historical context)
  - Revenue growth rate, margin trends, key expense drivers
  - Content amortization, marketing efficiency, R&D intensity
- Balance sheet & liquidity
  - Cash position, debt maturities, leverage ratios
  - Any off-balance sheet items or unusual accruals
- Cash flow analysis
  - Operating cash flow drivers, free cash flow, capital allocation (buybacks, dividends, debt repayments)
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Summary of sentiment signal, notable changes in opinion or risk factors
- Insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Net buy/sell activity, notable insiders, potential signaling
- Trend/ratio screen for traders
  - Valuation multiples vs. peers, margin of safety, growth vs. profitability trade-offs
  - Cash conversion cycle, efficiency metrics (CAC recovery, marketing spend efficiency)
- Risk factors and catalysts
  - Content slate risk, competitive pressures, regulatory considerations, pricing experiments
- Quick quantitative snapshot (if data available)
  - Key YoY/QoQ changes in revenue, margins, FCF
- Practical takeaways for trading decisions
  - If bullish: what triggers, what risk controls to observe
  - If bearish: warning signs, exit/hedge ideas

Markdown table format (to be appended at the end)
- A concise snapshot of key points, organized for quick scanning.

Example table (structure only; to be filled with actual data)
- Aspect | NFLX Status | Key Insight | Data Source
- Financials: Revenue | … | … | SimFin/Company filings
- Profitability: Net Margin | … | … | SimFin/Income
- Liquidity: Cash & Debt | … | … | SimFin/Balance Sheet
- Cash Flow: FCF | … | … | SimFin/Cashflow
- Insider Sentiment (past 15d) | … | … | Finnhub Sentiment
- Insider Transactions (past 15d) | … | … | Finnhub Transactions
- Valuation Signals | … | … | Market data
- Catalyst/Risk | … | … | Analyst notes

If you’d like me to proceed now, please choose one:
- Retry data retrieval now (I’ll attempt those tool calls again and then deliver the full report with the data).
- Proceed with a detailed qualitative framework (no past-week insider data) while we wait for tool access to come back.
- Provide data you already have (paste outputs from the tools or any sheets you’ve got), and I’ll assemble the complete report with the Markdown table.

Would you like me to retry immediately, or would you prefer a qualitative framework while we wait?
