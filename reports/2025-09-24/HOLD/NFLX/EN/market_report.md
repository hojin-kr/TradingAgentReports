I attempted to fetch NFLX data (Jan 1, 2024 to Sep 24, 2025) using the Yahoo Finance data tool, but the backend returned a FileNotFoundError. That means I can’t pull the price history right now to compute the indicators and produce a data-driven, trend-by-trend report for NFLX. If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch, try a narrower date range, or proceed with a framework you can apply once the data loads. In the meantime, here is a plan with the most relevant, non-redundant indicators I would use for NFLX, plus why they’re suitable for this stock and a structured interpretation framework you can use once data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; medium-term trend direction.
  - Why NFLX: Netflix often trades in clearer trend regimes over weeks to months; the 50 SMA helps confirm ongoing trend and acts as a dynamic support/resistance, useful around earnings cycles and product/category shifts.
  - How to interpret: Price above 50SMA with rising slope suggests a bullish medium-term trend; cross below can signal a potential trend change or consolidation.

- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend benchmark.
  - Why NFLX: The 200 SMA helps assess the broader regime (growth/reversion phases). Golden cross/death cross signals can frame strategic positioning.
  - How to interpret: Golden cross (price above and 50SMA/price action turning above 200SMA) indicates a longer-term uptrend; death cross (price below and 50SMA/price below 200SMA) signals longer-term weakness.

- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average; short-term momentum.
  - Why NFLX: Captures quicker shifts in momentum around new content cycles, subscriber news, or quarterly results.
  - How to interpret: Price crossing above the 10 EMA can precede short-term entries; crossing below can precede exits or risk-off moves. Use as a momentum filter around longer trend signals.

- macd
  - What it measures: MACD line (momentum via EMA differences) and trend strength.
  - Why NFLX: Netflix often exhibits momentum shifts after earnings or product/ads changes; MACD helps spot early momentum changes and potential reversals.
  - How to interpret: MACD line crossing above/below zero and crossovers with the signal line provide potential entry/exit signals; corroborate with price action and other indicators.

- macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD line).
  - Why NFLX: Adding the signal line helps smooth noise and reduces false positives in volatile periods (earnings weeks, subscriber announcements).
  - How to interpret: MACD vs MACDS crossovers are stronger signals when aligned with price action and other indicators.

- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative strength index; momentum and overbought/oversold levels.
  - Why NFLX: RSI helps identify overbought/oversold conditions around key levels, especially during high-volatility periods after earnings or guidance changes.
  - How to interpret: RSI above 70 signals potential overbought risk; below 30 signals oversold risk; watch for divergences between RSI and price for potential reversals. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods.

- boll
  - What it measures: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as the baseline for Bollinger Bands; volatility context with standard deviation bands around it.
  - Why NFLX: Helps gauge breakout potential and dynamic support/resistance in range-bound or trending phases; useful when earnings lead to range expansions.
  - How to interpret: Price touching or breaking the upper band can indicate overextension/bullish continuation in strong trends; price near the lower band may indicate oversold conditions or a potential bounce; tighten when bands squeeze (low volatility) followed by breakout.

- atr
  - What it measures: Average True Range; real-time volatility.
  - Why NFLX: Volatility can spike around earnings, subscriber milestones, or content lineups; ATR informs risk management and position sizing.
  - How to interpret: Rising ATR indicates expanding volatility (higher risk; adjust stops/position sizes); shrinking ATR indicates consolidation (lower risk; consider trailing stops or tighter risk controls).

What I would do next (once data is accessible)
- Retrieve full NFLX price history (2024-01-01 to 2025-09-24) and compute the eight indicators above.
- Generate a multi-indicator readout:
  - Trend frame: 50SMA vs 200SMA, price vs those levels.
  - Momentum frame: 10 EMA, MACD crossovers, RSI level and divergences.
  - Volatility/volatility-structure frame: Bollinger context and ATR.
  - Confirmation frame: How these signals align (e.g., price above 50SMA and MACD bullish with RSI not overbought).
- Provide a concise signal interpretation set (e.g., bullish setup, neutral, or bearish) with suggested actions and risk controls.
- Append a compact watchlist of key levels (support/resistance around 50SMA, 200SMA, Bollinger bands) and a plan for trades around earnings or catalysts.

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now, or try an alternative window (for example: 2023-01-01 to 2025-09-24 or the last 12–18 months) to get a workable dataset. Let me know your preference:
- Retry now with the same date range
- Try a shorter window (e.g., last 12–18 months)
- Use a different data source/date range you specify

Proposed indicators table (for quick reference)
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Category: Moving Averages | What it measures: 50-day SMA; Why relevant: medium-term trend; How to read: price above/below with slope direction indicates trend health; Caveats: Lags price; best used with faster signals for timing.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Category: Moving Averages | What it measures: 200-day SMA; Why relevant: long-term trend baseline; How to read: cross signals golden/death cross; Caveats: slow to respond; best for strategic framing.
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Category: Moving Averages (Momentum) | What it measures: 10-day EMA; Why relevant: quick momentum shifts; How to read: price crossing above/below indicates near-term entries/exits; Caveats: Noise in choppy markets.
- Indicator: macd | Category: MACD Related | What it measures: MACD line momentum; Why relevant: momentum shifts and trend changes; How to read: crossovers with zero line/with MACDS; Caveats: False signals in low-volatility ranges.
- Indicator: macds | Category: MACD Related | What it measures: MACD Signal line; Why relevant: smoother momentum confirmation; How to read: MACD vs MACDS cross; Caveats: Should be used with other filters.
- Indicator: rsi | Category: Momentum Indicators | What it measures: RSI momentum/overbought-oversold; Why relevant: divergence and levels near 70/30; How to read: overbought/oversold with trend confirmation; Caveats: Trend-driven RSI can stay overextended.
- Indicator: boll | Category: Volatility Indicators | What it measures: Bollinger Middle (20SMA) baseline; Why relevant: breakout vs reversal context; How to read: price vs middle band and band width; Caveats: In strong trends prices can ride bands.
- Indicator: atr | Category: Volatility Indicators | What it measures: Average True Range; Why relevant: volatility context; How to read: higher ATR = wider stops; Lower ATR = quieter ranges; Caveats: Reactive, not predictive.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed (retry now, adjust date range, or proceed with a placeholder analysis if data remains unavailable), and I’ll run the next steps accordingly.
