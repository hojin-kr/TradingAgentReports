Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock data for NFLX on 2025-09-24, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. That looks like a backend/tooling issue rather than your request. I can retry, or we can proceed without the Reddit feed and still build a strong, data-informed narrative using other sources (press releases, earnings sheets, general media coverage, investor relations materials) and sentiment proxies.

Options
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll report back with the latest available Reddit sentiment once the tool works).
- Option B: I proceed immediately with a comprehensive qualitative analysis structure and fill in data later as soon as the Reddit tool is available, plus I can incorporate other sources you specify.
- Option C: You provide alternative sources or a subset of sources you want included (e.g., only official Netflix PR, earnings call transcripts, major tech/news outlets).

What I can do right now (partial, no Reddit feed)
- Provide a clear structure for a comprehensive long-form report, with placeholders where Reddit sentiment data will go.
- Outline the key sentiment drivers and potential trader implications, focusing on NFLX’s current state as of 2025-09-24.
- Prepare a data-friendly framework (daily sentiment heatmap, topic clustering, event-driven notes) so that once Reddit data is back, I can plug it in without reworking the entire report.

Proposed structure for the final long report (to be filled with actual data)
- Executive snapshot
  - Summary of overall sentiment trend over the past week
  - Key news/events driving sentiment
  - Immediate implications for traders (short-term moves, risk factors)
- Social media sentiment overview
  - Daily sentiment scores (NFLX) with a day-by-day breakdown
  - Top positive/negative topics driving chatter
  - Platform-agnostic themes (e.g., content slate, pricing, competition, subscriber metrics)
- News and events snapshot (past week)
  - Summary of notable company announcements, earnings signals, partnerships, or regulatory/news events
  - Market/analyst responses and sentiment cues
- Sentiment drivers by theme
  - Content/Franchise pipeline (new releases, renewals, churn impact)
  - Pricing and incentives (ad-supported tier, password-sharing policies)
  - Competition and market positioning (D2C landscape, bundling, alternatives)
  - Subscriber/subscriber-macet (growth, churn, ARPU)
  - Financial/operational signals (subscriber growth vs. ARPU, profitability signals)
- Risk and catalysts
  - Near-term catalysts (earnings cadence, content milestones, policy changes)
  - Downside risks (subscriber saturation, ad market conditions, competitive pressure)
- Trader implications and scenarios
  - Bull case, base case, bear case scenarios with potential price/action implications
  - Suggested watchlist signals and thresholds (e.g., sentiment shifts, engagement spikes, content release milestones)
- Appendix: data notes and methodology
  - Data sources, caveats, and how sentiment is aggregated
  - Table: daily sentiment placeholders (to be filled when data arrives)

If you want me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll re-attempt the Reddit data fetch and then deliver a full, data-backed report with the Reddit component included. If you prefer Option B or C, I can start immediately with the structured analysis and leave placeholders for the Reddit data.

Please tell me which option you’d like. If you’d like me to retry now, I’ll attempt the Reddit fetch again right away and report back with the results and incorporate them into the full report.
