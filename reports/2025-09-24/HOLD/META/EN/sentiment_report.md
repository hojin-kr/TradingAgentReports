Thanks for your patience. I attempted to pull the latest Reddit sentiment data for META, but the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. That appears to be an internal issue with the data source right now, so I can’t fetch the day-by-day Reddit sentiment you asked for at this moment.

Here are your options so we can keep moving:

- Option A: Retry now to fetch Reddit data. I can re-attempt immediately and, if successful, merge that with the latest news and sentiment.
- Option B: Proceed with an interim, fully qualitative analysis using other sources (public news headlines, company press releases, regulatory/macro context) to produce a comprehensive report. This won’t include the Reddit-specific daily sentiment data, but I can still deliver a robust, trader-focused assessment.
- Option C: You provide an alternative data source or a copy of the latest Reddit sentiment you’ve captured, and I’ll incorporate it.

If you’d like me to proceed right away without Reddit data, here’s an interim, trader-focused analysis framework I can flesh out into a full long report. It will be qualitative (no precise daily sentiment scores) but structured to help traders understand near-term and longer-term implications for META.

High-level interim analysis (without Reddit data)
- Last week-to-date sentiment themes (qualitative)
  - Positive signals often center around META’s AI strategy and monetization potential via AI-assisted ad products, plus resilience in core ad revenue due to large user base (Facebook/Instagram) and robust cash flow.
  - Negative signals tend to involve regulatory scrutiny (privacy, antitrust, data practices), potential ad-market softness or macro headwinds, and the sizable investments in AI/Reality Labs that could pressure near-term margins.

- Recent company news and catalysts (contextual, non-date-specific)
  - AI strategy and product iteration: META continuing to push AI tools into advertising, content discovery, and creator monetization. Investors tend to reward clear, scalable AI monetization paths that can lift ad effectiveness and user engagement.
  - Reels/short-form dominance and monetization: The ongoing battle for creator monetization and user engagement on short-form video affects engagement metrics and ad inventory quality, which in turn influences ad revenue growth.
  - Hardware/AR-VR investment: Ongoing investments in VR/AR hardware and software (e.g., Quest ecosystem) offer potential long-term upside but come with cadence risk and capital expenditure considerations.
  - Regulatory and policy environment: Ongoing scrutiny around data privacy, platform policies, and potential antitrust actions can impact strategic flexibility and operating margins.
  - Economic backdrop: Ad markets often track macro ad spend cycles; sensitivity to consumer spending and advertiser budgets can influence META’s quarterly ad revenue growth.

- What this means for traders (mid-term and long-term)
  - If META demonstrates accelerating AI-driven ad monetization with stable margins, expect positive sentiment and multiple expansion potential, aided by share repurchases and strong free cash flow.
  - If regulatory risk intensifies or if the AI/VR spending weighs on profitability longer than expected, sentiment could turn cautious, pricing in higher risk to near-term earnings trajectory.
  - The stock’s reaction tends to hinge on earnings signals about ad revenue trajectory, margin evolution, and progress/timelines of AI-enabled monetization, more so than on user growth alone.

- Risks to watch
  - Regulatory headwinds and potential changes to data privacy/regulatory compliance costs.
  - Ad market cyclicality and any deceleration in advertiser spend.
  - Execution risk around monetizing AI features and VR hardware, including unit economics.
  - Competition from TikTok, YouTube, and other platforms in short-form video and social commerce.

- Short-term vs. longer-term implications
  - Short-term: Watch for quarterly earnings guidance, ad revenue growth rate, and any clear signs of margin stabilization as AI investments ramp.
  - Longer-term: The success of AI-enabled ad products and the monetization path for the Reality/VR ecosystem could be significant upside if the matures and scales efficiently.

Proposed structure for a full long report (when we have Reddit data)
- Executive Summary: Key sentiment takeaways, headline news, and actionable implications.
- Data & Methodology: Sources (Reddit, major news outlets, company disclosures), sentiment scoring approach, time window.
- Daily Sentiment Snapshot: META sentiment by day (Reddit), with drivers for each day.
- News Pulse: Summary of notable news events in the past week and their expected impact.
- Sentiment Breakdown: Positive, negative, neutral segments with subtle drivers (policy, AI, ads, hardware, user engagement).
- Catalyst Map: Near-term and longer-term catalysts with likely market impact.
- Financial Context: Ad revenue trends, profitability, margin trajectory, capex, cash flow.
- Competitive Landscape: TikTok, YouTube, X (Twitter), and other platforms; where META gains/loses.
- Risks & Mitigants: Regulatory, competitive, product execution, macro.
- Trading Implications: Scenarios (bullish, base, bearish) with actionable ideas (entry/exit, hedges, risk management).
- Appendix: Detailed sentiment tables, headlines, and data sources.
- Markdown table: At the end, a consolidated summary of key takeaways

If you want me to proceed with Option A (retry now) or Option B (full interim qualitative analysis), tell me which you prefer. If you have an alternate data source to pull from, share it and I’ll incorporate it.

Markdown table (template) to append at the end of the full report
- Category | Signals (Positive/Negative) | Primary Drivers | Data Source | Implications for Traders
- Sentiment Tone (Day-by-Day) | Positive / Neutral / Negative | e.g., AI monetization optimism, regulatory risk | Reddit (if available), News | Trading implications (entry/exit signals)
- Key News Highlights | Brief headline and impact | News Source | Market Impact
- Catalyst Proximity | Short-term / Medium-term | AI, regulatory decisions, earnings guidance | N/A | Potential moves in price/volatility
- Risks & Mitigants | Key risk factors and mitigation | N/A | N/A | Risk management guidance

Would you like me to retry pulling the Reddit data now, or would you prefer I proceed with Option B (interim qualitative analysis) or Option A plus a plan to re-run if the tool comes back online?
