Decision: Hold META

Rationale in brief
- The proposed plan integrates credible long-term AI monetization upside with near-term headwinds. META’s strength remains, but near-term margin progress depends on scalable AI licensing and enterprise monetization, which are still uncertain and potentially lumpy.
- Key near-term risks: ad-cycle sensitivity, ongoing Reality Labs/data-center capex, regulatory costs, and licensing deals that may land slower than hoped. Valuation remains premium, so any disappointment on near-term margins or licensing momentum could weigh on multiple expansion.
- Key longer-term supports: a sizable, engaged user base across multiple apps, in-house AI capabilities (Llama), and a framework to monetize across ads, licensing, and enterprise AI. If licensing deals materialize with clear margin uplift, the risk/reward could shift meaningfully toward upside.

What this means for action right now
- If you already hold META: maintain exposure but avoid aggressive adding at current levels. Implement risk controls and be prepared to shift to Buy if near-term milestones materialize and margins show real lift; shift to Sell if licensing momentum stalls or ad-revenue growth deteriorates meaningfully.
- If you don’t hold META yet: wait for clearer catalysts. Look for credible licensing agreements with margin uplift, tangible enterprise AI revenue visibility, or stabilized ad demand with improved efficiency metrics before initiating a starter position. Consider cautious, staged entry rather than a full commitment.

Concrete triggers to upgrade to Buy
- Credible, sizable licensing agreements or government/enterprise AI deployments with demonstrable margin uplift embedded in terms.
- Early evidence of margin stabilization or expansion driven by AI-enabled monetization, beyond top-line growth.
- Sustained improvement in ad efficiency and ROAS indicating AI-driven targeting is delivering meaningful profitability.

Concrete triggers to move to Sell or reduce exposure
- Licensing momentum stalls for a prolonged period (e.g., 6–9 months) with no margin uplift.
- Ad-revenue growth deteriorates with no compensating improvement from AI monetization; regulatory costs rise faster than anticipated.
- Valuation re-rating worsens due to slower-than-expected near-term profitability and execution risk.

Risk management notes
- Use ATR-based position sizing to limit volatility impact.
- Consider hedging (e.g., protective puts or collars) if near-term headlines risk a gap move or regulatory shock.
- Reassess quarterly around earnings; be ready to tilt toward Buy on clear margin improvements or toward Sell on persistent headwinds.
