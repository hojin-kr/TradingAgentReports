I attempted to fetch META data and indicators, but I ran into a environment error pulling the data (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data services. Specifically, the get_YFin_data call and the subsequent parallel calls to fetch the indicators failed due to missing files in the execution environment. I can retry the data fetch now or wait for the data service to be available again. In the meantime, here’s a concrete plan and the indicator setup I would use once data is available, along with a detailed, nuanced interpretation framework tailored for META.

Indicator selection (up to 8, diversified and complementary)
Rationale: To capture META’s trend, momentum, volatility, and volume-confirmed signals without redundancy, I’m proposing the following 8 indicators:
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- atr
- vwma

Why these 8 for META
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps confirm whether META is trading above/below a key benchmark.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend anchor; useful for assessing secular trend context and potential golden/death-cross implications.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum gauge; helps identify early shifts in price action that could precede more durable moves.
- macd, macds, macdh: A full MACD suite provides momentum crossovers (macd vs macds) and signal strength (macdh histogram) to confirm or question trend changes, especially around breakouts or pullbacks.
- atr: Volatility lens to gauge risk, set stops, and size positions relative to current market volatility; important in META’s sometimes volatile environment.
- vwma: Volume-confirmed trend signal; helps validate price moves with volume, reducing reliance on price action alone.

Nuanced interpretation framework for META (based on typical market dynamics and the chosen indicators)
- Trend context (50 SMA and 200 SMA)
  - If price remains above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA with 50 SMA above 200 SMA, view META as in a supportive uptrend with higher-probability long entries on pullbacks toward the 50/200 SMA confluence.
  - If price is below both SMAs and the 50 SMA is below the 200 SMA, treat as a bearish context; look for trend-resuming signals only after a robust reversal pattern or a clear change in MACD momentum.
  - Watch for golden/death cross signals (50 SMA crossing 200 SMA) as longer-term inflection cues; confirm with MACD and volume (VWMA) before acting.
- Momentum signals (MACD family)
  - MACD line crossing above MACD signal line (positive MACD histogram) supports upside momentum; crossing below supports downside momentum. In sideways markets, look for MACD divergence with price as a cautionary signal.
  - MACD histogram strength (macdh) helps gauge momentum acceleration or weakening; a rising histogram with price strength can reinforce a breakout, while a shrinking histogram may warn of a weakening move.
- Short-term momentum (10 EMA)
  - Breakouts/rollovers around the 10 EMA can offer entry/exit clues in conjunction with MACD crossovers; in choppy markets, use the 10 EMA with the longer SMAs to filter noise.
- Volatility and risk management (ATR)
  - Higher ATR suggests wider price swings; adjust stop losses and position sizes accordingly. In META, which can exhibit episodic volatility around earnings or AI/news events, ATR-based sizing is prudent.
- Volume confirmation (VWMA)
  - Price moves with rising VWMA reinforce conviction; price moves on weak volume should prompt caution or require additional confirmation (e.g., MACD or RSI if available in the dataset).
- Integration logic for META
  - Favor longs when price is above 50 and 200 SMA, MACD shows positive momentum (macd > macds, MACD histogram rising), ATR supports a breakout (not excessively large or contracting), and VWMA confirms with rising volume on a breakout or pullback test.
  - Favor shorts or cautious stance when price is below SMAs, MACD is negative or turning down, ATR is high but price action lacks VWMA-supported volume, indicating potential false breakouts.
  - In range-bound or low-volatility periods, rely more on MACD histogram and VWMA signals, while being cautious about whipsaws around earnings or product/news catalysts.
- Risk controls and scenario planning
  - Bullish continuation: price above 50/200 SMA, MACD bullish cross, rising MACD histogram, ATR showing manageable volatility, VWMA rising with volume on up moves.
  - Bearish continuation: price below SMAs, MACD bearish cross, falling MACD histogram, ATR elevated with price declines, VWMA confirmation on down moves.
  - Range-bound: oscillations near moving averages, MACD flat, VWMA mixed, ATR relatively low; avoid aggressive entries until breakout or breakdown signals emerge.

What I will do when data is available again
- Retrieve the daily price data for META from 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-24 (or your preferred window).
- Compute the 50 SMA, 200 SMA, 10 EMA, MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram, ATR, and VWMA.
- Produce a detailed trend report, including:
  - Current position relative to SMAs
  - MACD crossovers and histogram momentum
  - ATR-based volatility read
  - VWMA-confirmed trends
  - Any divergences (MACD histogram vs price, RSI if added in later steps)
- Append a Markdown table (see below) to summarize the key signals and interpretations at a glance.

Request for action
- Please confirm if you’d like me to retry fetching the data now or wait for the data service to be available again.
- If you have a preferred date window (e.g., up to a different end date) or want to include RSI or Bollinger bands in addition to the 8 indicators above, tell me and I’ll adjust the selection accordingly (note: we’ll stay within the 8-indicator limit).

Markdown table: Key indicators, interpretation, and META-specific notes
| Indicator | What it measures | META-specific interpretation | How to act (watch for signals) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average; medium-term trend | Indicates intermediate trend direction; supports identifying trend strength in META’s price action | Look for price crossing above/below 50 SMA; confirm with MACD and VWMA |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend | Long-term trend anchor; helps avoid premature entries in head/fake rallies | Golden cross (50 SMA above 200 SMA) or death cross signals; confirm with MACD and volume |
| close_10_ema | 10-period exponential moving average; short-term momentum | Quick read on momentum shifts; sensitive to news and intraday moves | Price crosses above/below 10 EMA; verify with MACD and VWMA |
| macd | MACD line; momentum cross indicator | Core momentum signal; used to confirm trend changes | MACD cross above MACD Signal supports long; cross below supports short; check histogram for strength |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Smoother trend change confirmation | Crosses with MACD as trigger; pair with price action and volume |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength gauge | Rising histogram supports momentum; falling histogram warns of weakening move |
| atr | Average True Range; volatility | Measures current market volatility for risk management | Higher ATR suggests wider stops; adjust position size accordingly |
| vwma | Volume-weighted moving average | Volume-confirmed trend; price action in context of volume | Up moves with rising VWMA indicate stronger conviction; down moves with rising VWMA warn of selling pressure |

Next steps
- I’ll retry data retrieval as soon as the data service is available. If you’d like, I can also switch to a slightly different window (e.g., 2023-01-01 to 2025-09-24) or include RSI as a ninth indicator if you’re comfortable expanding beyond 8 indicators (though default goal is 8 for complementary insights).

Would you like me to retry fetching META data now, or adjust any parameters (date range or indicator set) before I run again?
