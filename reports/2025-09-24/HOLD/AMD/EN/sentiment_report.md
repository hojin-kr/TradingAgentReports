Thanks for trying. The Reddit stock info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch Reddit data right now.

Here are options to move forward:

Option A – Retry and fetch Reddit data when the tool is back
- I’ll pull the latest AMD Reddit stock discussions for the past week and build a detailed, data-driven sentiment report with daily sentiment deltas, top themes, and notable posts.
- Then I’ll integrate any relevant AMD news from the same period and deliver a comprehensive trader-oriented analysis with actionable takeaways and a final Markdown table.

Option B – Use alternative sources you authorize
- I can compile a sentiment and news-focused analysis using other sources you permit (e.g., X/Twitter sentiment snippets, StockTwits threads, major financial news outlets). I’ll clearly label each source and indicate confidence/limitations.
- Deliver a similar trader-focused long report with a concluding table.

Option C – Wait and proceed with Reddit data only
- I wait until the Reddit tool is functioning again and then run the full, original plan (Reddit + news + sentiment) in one integrated report.

If you’d like, I can start now with Option A or B. In the meantime, here’s how the final report will be structured (so you know what to expect when we proceed):

- Executive snapshot: high-level sentiment trend for AMD over the past week, core catalysts (news, product cycles, AI/datacenter demand, supply chain signals).
- Daily sentiment breakdown: per-day sentiment score, volume, and key quotes/themes.
- Top themes by day: AI, GPU supply/demand, pricing, data center wins/losses, gaming cycle, partnerships, regulatory/legal chatter.
- News highlights: notable AMD news in the period (earnings, product launches, partnerships, guidance, supply chain updates, competitor moves).
- Risk and catalysts: factors that could shift sentiment (guidance changes, chip cycle peaking, macro shifts, Nvidia competition, AI demand trends).
- Trade implications: what the sentiment and news imply for short-term vs. longer-term positioning, with caveats.
- Quick takeaways for traders: levels to watch, potential catalysts, and risk flags.
- Summary table: a concise Markdown table of key points, themes, and implications.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and if you have any sources you want included (for Option B). If you want me to retry the Reddit data first, I can attempt again in a moment.
