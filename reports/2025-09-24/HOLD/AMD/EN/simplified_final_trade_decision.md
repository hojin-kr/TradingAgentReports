# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD has potential from long-term AI/data-center growth, but near-term risks and uncertain margin progress argue against adding now. Hold to wait for clearer cross-check signals and durable margin leverage.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: HOLD. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Long-term AI/data-center growth could lift AMD via MI-series GPUs, EPYC CPUs, and ROCm software, supported by a diversified platform.
- Near-term headwinds include Nvidia’s leadership, macro capex swings, and uncertainties in execution cadence and margin timing.
- Durable margin improvement likely requires multi-quarter progress, not a single strong quarter.
- The upside remains additive to Nvidia leadership; while the platform offers optionality, valuation and near-term risks justify a cautious stance.

## Risks To Watch
- Nvidia’s ongoing leadership and potential limits to AMD’s market share gains.
- Macro and data-center spending cycles that could slow demand.
- Execution cadence and the pace of margin uplift tied to AI mix.
- Valuation pressure that could keep the stock range-bound.
- Uptake or timing issues with MI-series, EPYC, and ROCm initiatives.
