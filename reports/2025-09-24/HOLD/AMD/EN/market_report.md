I attempted to fetch AMD data to compute the indicators, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry, or we can proceed with a recommended indicator setup and a detailed qualitative analysis based on AMD’s typical market drivers. Below is a carefully chosen set of indicators (8 total) designed to give complementary views without overlap, plus a nuanced AMD-focused interpretation you can use in the meantime.

Recommended indicator set for AMD (max 8, diverse signals)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale for each indicator and how it helps AMD analysis
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. For AMD, this helps identify the prevailing trend as AI/data-center cycles drive price swings. When price stays above the 50 SMA, it generally supports a constructive bias; a drop below can warn of a near-term pullback.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. The 200 SMA is a key reference for strategic bias (golden/death cross tendencies). For AMD, a confirmed uptrend above this level strengthens confidence in multi-quarter growth narratives (AI acceleration, data-center demand), while a break below can signal a structural shift.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum. Useful for catching faster moves around earnings or major AI/compute news. It can provide early signals of momentum shifts, but should be cross-checked with longer-term trend (50/200 SMA) to avoid whipsaws in choppy markets.
- macd: Momentum and trend change signals via MACD line vs. zero line and crossovers with the MACD Signal. For AMD, MACD crossovers can accompany AI/enterprise demand cycles or competitive shifts (e.g., data-center wins, AI accelerator announcements). Use in conjunction with price action and trend filters.
- macds: MACD Signal line. The MACD signal crossover strength and convergence/divergence help validate potential entries or exits when MACD alone might be ambiguous. Helps confirm momentum changes around earnings or guide exits in overextended moves.
- rsi: Momentum magnitude and potential overbought/oversold conditions. AMD often experiences sharp rallies and pullbacks around AI cycles and earnings. RSI thresholds (e.g., >70 overbought, <30 oversold) can flag potential reversals, but always cross-check with trend context since strong trends can push RSI into extreme zones for extended periods.
- atr: Volatility gauge. AMD frequently exhibits elevated volatility around earnings, AI demand updates, and supply/demand news. ATR informs position sizing and stop placement, helping manage risk during earnings-driven swings or macro risk events.
- vwma: Volume-adjusted trend confirmation. Combines price action with volume to validate moves. When price advances with rising VWMA, the move is more credible; declines on weak volume can warn of lack of conviction. Particularly useful for AMD where breakout moves around data-center/AI news can be volume-driven.

Nuanced AMD market context and how to interpret the indicators (hypothetical scenarios)
- Bullish scenario
  - Price trades above 50SMA and 200SMA with the 50SMA trending up toward/above the 200SMA (potential golden cross).
  - 10 EMA firmly above, signaling sustained short-term momentum.
  - MACD above zero with MACD line crossing the MACD signal and widening, indicating strengthening momentum.
  - RSI in the 50–70 zone or rising but not extreme; volume-supported advances reflected by rising VWMA.
  - ATR rising modestly, reflecting healthy volatility but not outsized risk; stop levels can be adjusted higher to give room for moves.
  - Action: Look for pullbacks toward the 50SMA or 200SMA for potential entries, with risk managed by ATR-based stops and VWMA-confirmed breakouts.
- Neutral/transition scenario
  - Price trades near the 50SMA with the 50SMA hovering near the 200SMA; the 10 EMA crosses the 50SMA back and forth.
  - MACD around the zero line or small crossovers; RSI fluctuating near mid-range; VWMA shows mixed volume.
  - ATR moderate; price range-bound with occasional spikes on earnings/news.
  - Action: Trade with tighter risk controls, wait for a decisive MACD cross and a clear VWMA-confirmed move away from the range before committing larger positions.
- Bearish scenario
  - Price breaks below the 200SMA or remains below the 50SMA with the 50SMA lagging under the 200SMA.
  - 10 EMA crosses below the 50SMA; MACD weakens toward/through zero with a potential negative histogram; RSI trends lower toward 30s.
  - ATR spikes during volatility spikes (earnings, supply concerns, or AI-cycle concerns), suggesting wider stops or reduced position size.
  - VWMA declines or diverges from price, signaling weaker volume-support for moves.
  - Action: Consider reducing exposure or hedging; look for confirmation from a VWMA-supported downside breakout or a MACD/MACD Signal alignment with price.

Notes and cautions
- AMD’s moves are highly sensitive to AI demand signals, data-center growth, GPU supply/demand dynamics, and competitive positioning (e.g., vs. Nvidia). Macro risk and earnings surprises can cause outsized moves relative to the indicators.
- Always confirm signals with price action rules (e.g., price closes above/below key levels) and cross-indicator validation to avoid false positives in volatile periods.
- If you’d like, I can attempt to fetch the data again now and run these indicators to provide a precise, date-stamped readout. Alternatively, I can adjust the indicator mix if you have a preferred focus (e.g., more volume emphasis, or more emphasis on trend vs. momentum).

Key points table
- Indicator: close_50_sma | What it measures: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | AMD interpretation: Indicates mid-term trend health; use with longer trend (200SMA) to confirm bias | Suggested action: If price stays above, look for pullbacks toward 50SMA for entries; if price collapses below, reassess trend.
- Indicator: close_200_sma | What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark | AMD interpretation: Sets strategic bias; crossovers matter for multi-quarter outlook | Suggested action: Above 200SMA = bullish bias; below = monitor for trend reversal signals.
- Indicator: close_10_ema | What it measures: Short-term momentum | AMD interpretation: Captures fast shifts around AI/news events | Suggested action: Use with trend filters to avoid whipsaws; look for cross above/below with confirmation.
- Indicator: macd | What it measures: Momentum and trend change signals | AMD interpretation: Momentum shifts around earnings/AI updates | Suggested action: Confirm with price and VWMA; use as a timing aid rather than sole trigger.
- Indicator: macds | What it measures: MACD signal line dynamics | AMD interpretation: Supports or contradicts MACD cross signals | Suggested action: Use in conjunction with MACD and price action for entries/exits.
- Indicator: rsi | What it measures: Momentum magnitude and overbought/oversold conditions | AMD interpretation: Helps gauge potential reversals in uptrends or downtrends | Suggested action: Avoid overreliance during strong trends; look for divergences with price.
- Indicator: atr | What it measures: Volatility level | AMD interpretation: Reflects earnings/news-driven swings | Suggested action: Use for risk sizing and stops; higher ATR suggests wider stops.
- Indicator: vwma | What it measures: Volume-adjusted price trend | AMD interpretation: Validates moves with volume; important for confirming breakouts | Suggested action: Prefer moves with rising VWMA to validate trend continuation.

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now and generate a precise, date-stamped indicator report for AMD (including exact values and a chart-ready readout), say “retry” and I’ll run the data fetch and produce the full indicators analysis.
