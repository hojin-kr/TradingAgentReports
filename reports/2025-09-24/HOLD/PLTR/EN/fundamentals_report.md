I attempted to fetch the latest PLTR fundamentals and insider data, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError for all requested tools. This appears to be an internal tool/environment issue rather than a problem with PLTR data. I can retry automatically, or you can authorize me to proceed with a structured framework and placeholder placeholders until the data fetch succeeds.

Options:
- Option 1: I retry all data fetches now and then deliver the full, data-filled report as soon as they succeed.
- Option 2: I provide a comprehensive, fully structured report framework right away, with explicit sections and placeholders for the data points, so you can review the plan and I can fill in the numbers once the tools come back online.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option 2 now, here’s a detailed report framework you can expect, along with a ready-to-fill Markdown table at the end.
