I tried to fetch PLTR data and compute the requested indicators, but I’m hitting an environment issue: the data retrieval tools returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) for the PLTR dataset. I can’t generate the actual indicator values right now. If you’d like, I can retry in a moment or proceed with a plan and interpretation framework you can apply once data access is restored.

In the meantime, here is a concise, complementary set of indicators I recommend for PLTR given its typical tech/ growth-stock behavior and the current date context (2025-09-24). I’ve limited to 8 indicators to avoid redundancy and to provide diverse insights (trend, momentum, and volatility).

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify the prevailing trend when combined with price action.
  Key signals: Price crossing above/below 50SMA, confluence with price structure.

- close_200_sma
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming broader market context (golden/death cross potential with faster averages).
  Key signals: Price above 200SMA indicates bullish bias; price below suggests bearish bias; use as a higher-timeframe filter.

- close_10_ema
  Why: Responsive short-term momentum gauge; quick to reflect shifts in flow.
  Key signals: Price crossing above/below 10EMA; cross with longer averages provides early entries/exits.

- macd
  Why: Core momentum measure based on EMA differences; helps catch trend changes.
  Key signals: MACD line crossing the MACD signal, histogram movement (positive/negative).

- macds
  Why: MACD signal line; confirms MACD cross events and filters false positives.
  Key signals: MACD crossing its signal line; use in conjunction with MACD for entries.

- macdh
  Why: MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential.
  Key signals: Growing histogram confirms momentum direction; shrinking/negative histogram signals weakening momentum or potential reversal.

- rsi
  Why: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold context; useful for spotting potential reversals when combined with trend.
  Key signals: RSI approach to 70/30 thresholds; look for divergences with price in trend conditions.

- atr
  Why: Measures volatility; essential for risk management and position sizing.
  Key signals: Rising ATR signals higher volatility (adjust stops/targets); low ATR implies tighter stops may be viable.

How to use these together (practical guidance)
- Trend confirmation: Look for price above both 50SMA and 200SMA for a bullish bias; price below both for bearish bias.
- Momentum alignment: Prefer long entries when MACD is bullish (MACD > Signal) and MACD histogram positive, with RSI not in extreme overbought territory if the trend is up.
- Entry filters: Use crossovers of 10EMA with price as a short-term momentum trigger, but only take trades that align with the longer-term trend (50SMA/200SMA direction) and MACD momentum.
- Risk management: Use ATR-derived volatility to set stop distances and position sizing; higher ATR means wider stops and/or smaller position sizes to maintain risk controls.
- Volatility awareness: If ATR spikes, expect wider intraday swings; adjust targets and stops accordingly. If ATR contracts, you may tighten stops and consider nearer-term profits.
- Overbought/oversold caveat: In strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; use trend context and MACD signals rather than RSI alone to avoid premature exits.

Notes and next steps
- Once the data retrieval issue is resolved, I will compute these 8 indicators for PLTR for your chosen window (e.g., last 6–12 months), generate a detailed trend/trade interpretation, and present a structured decision framework (entry, exit, risk controls).
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative interpretation framework now (without actual numeric outputs) and then plug in exact readings as soon as data access is restored.

Key points at a glance (table)
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Role: Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Signals: Price above/below 50SMA; crossovers with price | Use: Align trades with medium-term trend; filter with price action
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Role: Long-term trend context | Signals: Price above/below 200SMA; potential golden/death cross with shorter averages | Use: Higher-timeframe bias filter; look for pullbacks to enter with trend
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Role: Short-term momentum | Signals: Price crossing 10EMA; momentum shift | Use: Lightweight entry filter; confirm with MACD
- Indicator: macd | Role: Core momentum | Signals: MACD crossing MACD Signal; histogram direction | Use: Primary momentum confirmation; trade in direction of MACD trend
- Indicator: macds | Role: MACD signal smoothing | Signals: MACD vs Signal cross | Use: Confirms MACD-based entries/exits
- Indicator: macdh | Role: Momentum strength | Signals: Histogram rising/falling; divergence with price | Use: Early momentum cues; avoid trades on histogram alone
- Indicator: rsi | Role: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | Signals: 30/70 thresholds; divergences | Use: Cautious stance in overbought/oversold zones; rely on trend context
- Indicator: atr | Role: Volatility and risk control | Signals: Higher ATR = higher volatility; lower ATR = quieter markets | Use: Set stops and position sizing; adapt targets to volatility regime

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or should I proceed with applying this framework as soon as data access is restored? If you want, I can also switch to a cached/simulated data approach to illustrate how the outputs would look.
