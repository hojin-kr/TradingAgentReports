Sorry about that — the get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError) when trying to fetch PLTR data for 2025-09-24. I can retry the tool now, or proceed with a data-collection plan that doesn’t rely on that specific tool and provide a detailed framework you can use once the Reddit data fetch is working again. Which would you prefer?

If you’d like me to proceed with a thorough framework in the meantime, here’s a comprehensive plan and a ready-to-fill template for the PLTR sentiment/news analysis. This will be ready to populate as soon as the Reddit data fetch succeeds.

PLTR Sentiment & News Analysis Plan (Post-Tool-Error)
- Objective: Deliver a granular view of Palantir (PLTR) sentiment from social media (Reddit and others), recent company news, and implications for traders over the past week.
- Data sources (when available): Reddit threads and posts, other social sentiment streams, latest company news, earnings filings, product announcements, leadership actions, and major contract wins/terminations.
- Key outputs:
  - Daily sentiment trajectory (net positive vs. negative)
  - Top discussion themes per day
  - Notable news catalysts and their market implications
  - Short-term trading implications and risk factors
  - A compact, readable summary for traders
- Analytical lenses:
  - Narrative shifts (e.g., growth vs. profitability focus, government contracts vs. commercial exposure)
  - Event-driven deltas (earnings, contract wins, regulatory updates)
  - Crowd temperature (e.g., enthusiasm around new products, skepticism around guidance)
- Deliverables format:
  - Narrative write-up with sub-sections
  - Daily sentiment delta chart narrative (no chart required here)
  - A final “Key Points” table in Markdown

Markdown table (Key points template)
Note: This table is a placeholder you can populate once the Reddit data and news are available. It’s designed to summarize daily sentiment, topics, and potential market implications.

| Date | Source | Net Sentiment (Pos/Neg) | Top Topic / Theme | Notable News Catalyst | Price/Market Implication | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------|

What would you like to do next?
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then produce a filled-out, detailed long report with the latest week’s sentiment and news.
- Option B: I proceed with the framework and the empty template above and wait for your go-ahead to fill in the data as soon as the tool is available.
- Option C: If you have alternate sources or specific Reddit subreddits you want prioritized (e.g., r/Palantir, r/investing, etc.), tell me and I’ll target those areas once the data tool is functioning.

If you want me to retry immediately, say “Retry now” and I’ll attempt another fetch for PLTR on 2025-09-24 and proceed with a full write-up as soon as the data comes through.
