I ran into a data-access issue on the backend:

- Attempt to fetch SPY data via get_YFin_data failed with a FileNotFoundError. I can retry once the data source is available again, or proceed with a framework you can use once data is back.

In the meantime, here is a concise, well-structured plan using eight complementary indicators that would give you a robust view of SPY when data is retrievable. I’ve chosen these to cover trend, momentum, volatility, and volume without redundancy.

Selected indicators (8)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these eight are suitable for SPY
- Trend perspective: close_50_sma and close_200_sma capture medium- and long-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. The relationship between the two helps identify golden/death-cross situations and overall regime.
- Momentum signals: macd and macds provide momentum crossovers and strength. They are widely followed for trend-change signals and can help filter entries when price action is choppy.
- Short-term momentum filter: close_10_ema acts as a responsive gauge of near-term momentum, enabling timely entry/exit signals when used with the MACD pair.
- Momentum/overbought-oversold context: rsi highlights overbought or oversold conditions and potential reversals, especially when diverging from price or trend direction.
- Volatility and breakout framing: boll (Bollinger middle, i.e., 20-SMA) serves as a dynamic reference for price movement relative to a standard volatility envelope; it pairs well with band signals for breakouts or reversion in SPY.
- Volatility sizing: atr provides a quantitative measure of current volatility, guiding risk management (stop placement, position sizing) in line with SPY’s characteristic volatility regimes.

Nuanced interpretation framework (how you’d read these together)
- Trend alignment checks:
  - If price is above both 50_sma and 200_sma and both SMAs are rising, that’s a bullish macro alignment. Use pullbacks toward the 50_sma as potential entries, with MACD confirming momentum.
  - If price is below both SMAs and they’re trending downward, that’s a bearish alignment. Look for rallies toward the 50_sma as potential resistance tests and short-side signals confirmed by MACD.
- Momentum confirmation:
  - MACD crossing above its signal (macd crossing above macds) alongside price above the 50_sma reinforces a bullish tilt; macd crossing below macds with price under the 50_sma reinforces bearish control.
  - The 10-period EMA (close_10_ema) crossing price can provide a quick momentum nudge, but use it with MACD and RSI to avoid noise.
- RSI guidance (rsi):
  - RSI rising toward or above 60–70 in a bullish trend supports strength, but watch for overbought readings near 70–75 in a strong uptrend; look for divergence or price rejection at resistance levels for potential reversals.
  - RSI dipping toward 30–35 in a downtrend aligns with oversold conditions; use price action near support and MACD crossovers to gauge continuation vs. reversal.
- Volatility and breakout context (boll and atr):
  - Bollinger middle (boll) provides a dynamic centerline. Price crossing above middle with widening bands can signal breakout strength; price riding the bands in a strong trend can indicate sustained momentum.
  - ATR (atr) tells you how much room you have for price moves. Rising ATR suggests wider stops and larger position sizing could be appropriate; declining ATR implies tighter ranges and possibly lower-risk entries but more careful timing.
- Practical trade-setup logic (no guarantees, just a framework):
  - Bullish setup: price above 50_sma and 200_sma, macd > macds with MACD increasing, RSI trending up (not overbought), price holding above boll middle with rising ATR.
  - Bearish setup: price below 50_sma and 200_sma, macd < macds with MACD declining, RSI rolling over toward oversold without extreme deviation, price testing lower Bollinger band with rising ATR indicating potential continuation.

What I would do next (once data access works)
- Re-run the eight indicators for SPY with the same date window (or your preferred lookback).
- Build a concise signal protocol (e.g., enter long when all three trend/momentum checks align and ATR supports a reasonable stop; exit or short when they flip).
- Provide a summarized action briefing (entries, exits, risk management) based on real-time data.

Proposed table to organize key points (for quick reference)
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average (mid-term trend)
  - How to interpret: Price relative to 50_sma; crossovers signal trend changes/dynamic support
  - Suggested action: Bullish if price above and 50_sma rising; use pullbacks toward 50_sma as potential entries
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-day moving average (long-term trend)
  - How to interpret: Position relative to 200_sma indicates long-term regime
  - Suggested action: Use for bias confirmation; golden/death cross with 50_sma adds conviction
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum
  - How to interpret: Price/EMA cross signals quick shifts; more noise
  - Suggested action: Use with MACD and RSI for timing
- Indicator: macd
  - What it measures: Momentum via MACD line
  - How to interpret: Positive/negative momentum; crossovers indicate potential trend changes
  - Suggested action: Buy when MACD crosses above MACDS; sell when it crosses below
- Indicator: macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line
  - How to interpret: Smoother momentum signal; crossovers with MACD confirm entries/exits
  - Suggested action: Use with MACD for trade triggers
- Indicator: rsi
  - What it measures: Momentum strength (overbought/oversold)
  - How to interpret: RSI extremes suggest reversals; watch for divergences
  - Suggested action: Confirm with trend and MACD before acting on extremes
- Indicator: boll
  - What it measures: Bollinger middle (20-SMA) reference
  - How to interpret: Price relative to middle line and band width signals volatility/ breakouts
  - Suggested action: Breakouts above middle with expanding bands can add conviction
- Indicator: atr
  - What it measures: Average true range (volatility)
  - How to interpret: Higher ATR = larger expected moves; lower ATR = compressing ranges
  - Suggested action: Adjust stops and position sizing accordingly

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval as soon as the data service is available, or you can specify a different date range or tickers. I can also proceed with a hypothetical scenario using assumed values to illustrate decision rules if that helps.

Would you like me to retry fetching SPY data now, or proceed with a hypothetical example to illustrate how these eight indicators would interplay?
