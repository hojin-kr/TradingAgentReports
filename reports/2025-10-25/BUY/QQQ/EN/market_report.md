I attempted to retrieve data for QQQ, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I tried again with the same parameters, and the error persisted. This suggests the environment currently doesn’t have access to the required CSV data source for get_YFin_data. To keep moving, you have a few options:
- Retry data fetch after a short interval (the issue may be temporary).
- Narrow the date range (e.g., last 6–12 months) to see if a smaller dataset loads.
- Allow me to switch to an alternative data source or format (if you approve), or proceed with a purely indicator-driven framework and wait for data to load.
- Proceed now with a designed set of indicators and a plan for how I will interpret them once data is available.

Indicator plan (8 indicators) for QQQ (tech-heavy ETF)
Rationale: Since QQQ tracks a tech-heavy index, the combination below provides a balanced view of long-term trends, short-term momentum, volatility, and price action without redundancy.

- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it tells you: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Look for price trading above/below the 50SMA for trend confirmation; monitor for pullbacks to the 50SMA as potential bounce points or resistance checks in uptrends.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it tells you: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major regime shifts.
  - How to use: Confirm overarching trend with the 200SMA; golden cross/Death cross signals (50SMA crossing 200SMA) can provide strategic context for positioning.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - What it tells you: Short-term momentum shifts and quick entry/exit cues.
  - How to use: Use as a faster filter; look for crossovers with price or with longer-term averages to time entries in a trending context.

- macd
  - Category: MACD
  - What it tells you: Momentum and potential trend changes via differences of EMAs.
  - How to use: Watch for MACD line crossing the Signal line, and corroborate with price action and trend direction from other indicators.

- macds
  - Category: MACD
  - What it tells you: MACD signal line; smoothing of MACD for signal generation.
  - How to use: Use MACD vs MACDS crossovers as trade triggers in combination with other filters to reduce false signals.

- macdh
  - Category: MACD
  - What it tells you: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence signals.
  - How to use: Positive/expanding histogram supports bullish momentum; negative/contracting histogram supports bearish momentum; watch for divergence with price.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum
  - What it tells you: Relative strength momentum; overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: Use 70/30 thresholds and look for bullish/bearish divergences; in strong uptrends RSI can remain elevated, so cross-check with trend indicators.

- boll
  - Category: Volatility
  - What it tells you: Bollinger Middle (20SMA) as a dynamic benchmark; context for price movement relative to a moving average.
  - How to use: Use in conjunction with upper/lower bands for breakout/reversal context; price testing the Boll/Middle line can signal pullbacks or continuation when supported by other indicators.

Notes on usage and integration
- Use a multi-indicator confirmation approach: avoid acting on a single indicator; require alignment across trend (50/200SMA), momentum (MACD family and RSI), and volatility (boll) to improve signal quality.
- In a high-variance tech environment, MACD components plus RSI help identify momentum extremes and potential reversals, while moving averages establish whether you’re biasing trades with the longer-term trend.
- If data loading succeeds, I can generate a synchronized readout (e.g., current values, crossovers, divergence signals, and a trend/bias assessment) and provide concrete trade-level guidance (entries, stops, risk considerations) based on these eight indicators.

Proposed next steps
- Would you like me to retry loading the data now (possibly with a shorter date range such as the last 6–12 months), or would you prefer I proceed with this indicator framework and deliver a structured analysis once data becomes available?
- If you’re okay with it, I can also add a lightweight plan for risk management (e.g., ATR-based stop placement) once data is loaded.

Markdown table: Key indicators and rationale for QQQ
| Indicator | Category | What it Measures | How to Use for QQQ | Notes |
|---------|----------|------------------|---------------------|------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Confirm trend direction; use pullbacks to 50SMA as potential entry/exit points in uptrends | Lagging but useful with other signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend baseline | Confirm overall regime; watch for golden/death crosses with 50SMA | Strategic context rather than frequent signals |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Time-entry/exit cues; use with longer averages to filter noise | More responsive, prone to whipsaws in choppy markets |
| macd | MACD | Momentum/trend changes via EMA differences | Crossovers indicate potential trend changes; confirm with other signals | Best in conjunction with other filters |
| macds | MACD | MACD signal line smoothing | Cross with MACD for trade triggers | Helps filter false positives |
| macdh | MACD | Momentum strength and divergence | Positive/expanding histogram supports up moves; watch divergence | Can be volatile; use with other signals |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold conditions | 70/30 thresholds; watch for divergences | Trend context matters; use with trend indicators |
| boll | Volatility | Bollinger Middle line as dynamic benchmark | Context for breakouts/reversals; confirm with other signals | Use alongside bands for better breakout signals |

If you’d like me to retry data loading now, I’ll attempt again and, once loaded, proceed to compute the indicators and provide a detailed, data-driven report.
