I attempted to pull the Reddit sentiment data for QQQ over the requested dates, but I hit a tool error:

- The Reddit sentiment fetch returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t retrieve live posts or sentiment scores right now. I can’t access the current week’s social data until the tool environment is restored.

Here are your options and my current plan:

Option A — Wait and retry (preferred for a complete, data-driven report)
- I will re-run the parallel fetch as soon as the tool is available again and compile a full, week-by-week sentiment analysis for QQQ (Reddit posts by day, topic clusters, and polarity). 
- I will also pull the latest news relevant to QQQ and its underlying Nasdaq-100 components for the same timeframe and combine them with social sentiment.

Option B — Proceed with a qualitative framework now (no live data)
- I can deliver a thorough, trader-focused analytical framework and a plausible scenario-driven interpretation you can use immediately, with a plan to plug in the actual data once the tool is back online.
- I’ll still deliver a structured long report outline, including how to interpret sentiment, what to watch for, and actionable implications for traders.

If you want me to proceed right away with Option B, here is the plan I’ll follow and the content I’ll produce (ready to fill in with data when available):

1) Executive snapshot
- 1-2 sentence summary of the week’s mood around QQQ, with caveats about data gaps.
- High-level drivers: macro backdrop, tech sector narratives, AI hype, notable earnings or macro events that shift sentiment.

2) Daily sentiment framework (7-day window)
- For each date (e.g., 2025-10-25 to 2025-10-19):
  - Sentiment direction: bullish / bearish / neutral
  - Main Reddit topics (e.g., AI hype, sector rotation, volatility, ETF structure)
  - Magnitude cues (e.g., sentiment polarity score range, notable spikes)
  - Correlations to price/volatility (qualitative)

3) News sentiment and headlines (7-day window)
- Key headlines driving sentiment (e.g., tech earnings, Fed commentary, macro data)
- General bite: positive/negative/neutral tone and possible impact on QQQ

4) Thematic clusters and drivers
- AI/tech mega-cap orientation
- Rate/monetary policy and macro risk
- Market structure effects (hedging activity, option skew, correlation with NASDAQ/QQQ)
- News catalysts that moved sentiment (earnings beats/misses, regulatory headlines)

5) Cross-source sentiment triangulation
- How Reddit sentiment aligns or diverges from other signals (if we later pull Twitter/X or other sources)
- Where sentiment is strongest vs. weakest (e.g., long-horizon holders vs. short-term traders)

6) Implications for traders and investors
- Short-term trading signals: potential entry/exit windows around sentiment shifts
- Medium-term posture: how sustained mood affects trend, pullbacks, or breakouts
- Risk considerations: sentiment-driven whipsaws, healthcare/semiconductor/AI stock surprises, macro shifts
- Positioning ideas: hedging approaches, options strategies, or exposure tilts

7) Risk flags and caveats
- Data limitations (Reddit-only view if other sources aren’t available)
- Potential biases in retail sentiment data
- Market regime dependence and how sentiment signals may perform differently in high vs. low volatility periods

8) Data-collection plan (for when the tool is back)
- Exact data sources to pull: Reddit posts for QQQ, daily tone/score, top topics; major news headlines; optional: Twitter/X sentiment
- Methods: lexicon-based vs. machine-learning sentiment scoring, topic modeling approaches
- Quality checks: duplicate posts, bot filtering, normalization across days

9) Markdown table (to be populated when data is available)
- A filled-in version of a key points table will be appended at the end, with columns such as Date, Reddit Sentiment, Main Topics, News Headline Tone, Implied Trader Takeaway, and Price/NAV context.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry when the tool is back) or Option B (deliver the framework now), please confirm. In the meantime, I can also provide a generic, non-dated summary of how QQQ sentiment typically reacts to tech-sector news and macro factors, which can serve as a provisional guide until the data arrives.

Would you prefer I retry fetching Reddit data immediately once the tool is available, or would you like me to start with the qualitative framework (Option B) right away?
