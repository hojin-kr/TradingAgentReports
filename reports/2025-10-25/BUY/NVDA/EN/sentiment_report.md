I ran into an internal error with the Reddit data tool (FileNotFoundError). It didn’t return the expected Reddit-stock feed for NVDA on 2025-10-25.

Options to proceed:
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now (or after a short interval) to pull the latest posts and sentiment.
- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort NVDA analysis using available sources besides Reddit (news, general social sentiment from other platforms, and recent company announcements) and clearly note where Reddit data is missing. This can still yield a thorough, trader-focused report.

If you’d like, I can start with Option B immediately and deliver a comprehensive NVDA sentiment-and-news report, then retry the Reddit feed in parallel or on the next pass.

What I can provide right now (Option B approach):
- Scope: A detailed NVDA report focused on social sentiment (excluding Reddit-specific data due to tool issue), recent news, and implications for traders over the past week. I’ll highlight notable themes, sentiment polarity shifts, key events, and potential risk/reward signals for traders.
- What the report will cover:
  - Executive snapshot: Brief on NVDA’s positioning, AI demand tailwinds, and macro considerations relevant to NVDA as of 2025-10-25.
  - Social sentiment: Day-by-day qualitative sentiment trends from available sources (e.g., general social chatter, press commentary, and prominent market voices) with notable spikes or turning points.
  - News and events: A timeline of relevant company news, AI, data-center, or supply-chain developments, regulatory considerations, and major market moves affecting NVDA.
  - Price/volatility implications: How sentiment and news patterns could translate into possible trading setups (short-term catalysts, volatility expectations, gaps, etc.).
  - Risk factors: Potential headwinds (competition, supply-demand shifts, macro shocks, regulatory risk) and how traders might manage them.
  - Signals and caveats: Clear notes on data gaps (no Reddit feed for now) and the confidence level of each signal.
  - Actionable takeaways: If you’re positioning, what to watch next (catalysts, price levels, and risk controls).

Proposed Markdown table (to append at end) — structure you’ll see once data is populated:
- Key Theme
- Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
- Source(s) (e.g., mainstream news, non-Reddit social chatter)
- Recent News/Events
- Potential Trading Implication
- Confidence Level (Low/Med/High)

Please tell me which route you want:
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now (Option A), or
2) Go ahead with the Option B comprehensive report based on other sources, and I’ll deliver the full analysis with a Markdown table at the end.

If you choose Option B, I’ll proceed immediately and deliver the report in the next message.
