Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for AAPL (curr_date 2025-10-25), but the tool returned an internal FileNotFoundError. I can retry shortly, but I don’t want to stall your analysis. Here are two paths we can take right now:

Option A — Retry and continue with the full, tool-driven report
- I’ll keep trying to fetch the Reddit data and then deliver a comprehensive long-form report with:
  - Daily sentiment breakdown over the past week
  - Key social/posting themes (dominant topics, memes, catalysts)
  - Summary of recent company news (earnings, product launches, regulatory updates)
  - Tactical implications for traders (short-term catalysts, risk factors)
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing the key points

Option B — Proceed without Reddit data for now, using other sources
- I’ll generate a thorough report based on alternative sources (official Apple news, earnings releases, major media coverage, industry analysis) and clearly note that Reddit sentiment data is pending.
- The structure remains the same, and I’ll append the same Markdown table at the end.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with Option B (no Reddit data for now), I can draft the report and update you as soon as the Reddit tool comes back online so I can incorporate that data too.

Additionally, here is a working outline of the long report I’ll produce once data is in, plus the Markdown table format I’ll append:

Proposed report outline (for traders/investors)
- Executive snapshot (up-to-date takeaway on mood, risk, and catalysts)
- Social sentiment read
  - Overall tone over the past 7 days
  - Daily sentiment trend (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Dominant topics driving sentiment (e.g., product cycles, AI/ML, Services growth, supply chain, regulatory news)
- News and fundamentals recap (past week)
  - Earnings or guidance updates
  - Product announcements or hardware/software news
  - Regulatory or legal developments
  - Supply chain/operational updates
- Thematic drivers and implications
  - Short-term catalysts (days to weeks)
  - Medium-term risks and uncertainties
  - Long-term structural trends (services mix, ecosystem lock-in, AI initiatives)
- Trading and risk considerations
  - Implied volatility context
  - Options activity signals (if data available)
  - Key levels to watch (support/resistance, moving averages if applicable)
- Fine-grained, day-by-day sentiment granularity (if Reddit/SM data available)
  - Day 1: themes, net sentiment
  - Day 2: themes, net sentiment
  - …
- Summary for traders: actionable takeaways, with a balanced view of upside vs. risk

 Markdown table (end of report) – example schema
- Topic | Data Source | Sentiment (Pos/Neu/Neg) | Key Points | Date Range
- Social sentiment | Reddit/SM | Positive | Example: “AI/vision hardware buzz, strong iPhone demand” | 2025-10-19 to 2025-10-25
- News recap | Apple press/news | Neutral/Positive | Example: “Services growth remained solid; capex guidance” | 2025-10-19 to 2025-10-25
- Catalysts | Earnings/Guidance | Positive/Neutral | Example: “Upcoming product refresh cycle” | 2025-10-25

Please tell me which option you prefer (Retry now or proceed without Reddit data). If you choose Option A, I’ll attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately and compile the full report once it returns. If you prefer Option B, I’ll start drafting the full analysis now and clearly flag Reddit data as pending.
