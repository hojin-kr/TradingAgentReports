I attempted to fetch data and run the indicator checks, but the data retrieval failed due to a file access error (FileNotFoundError) in the data pipeline. I can retry the data fetch right away or proceed with a structured qualitative analysis using the chosen indicators. Please tell me if you want me to retry the data pull now, or proceed with a scenario-based interpretation using the eight indicators below.

Proposed indicator set for AAPL (up to 8 indicators)
Reasoning: These provide complementary angles on trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management without redundancy. They help confirm signals and filter noise in a large-cap stock like Apple (AAPL) on a daily/shorter horizon.

Selected indicators (8)
- close_50_sma
  What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  How to use: Price trading above 50 SMA suggests an Uptrend bias; price below implies potential downtrend or consolidation. Crosses with price can indicate pullbacks or breakouts.

- close_200_sma
  What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend benchmark.
  How to use: Price above 200 SMA generally signals a bullish longer-term trend; price below suggests bearish long-term bias. Golden cross (50 SMA crossing above 200 SMA) or death cross (50 SMA crossing below 200 SMA) can be meaningful trend signals.

- close_10_ema
  What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average; short-term momentum proxy.
  How to use: Reacts quickly to price moves; use to spot early shifts in momentum and potential short-term entries, but filter with longer-term trend (50/200 SMA) to avoid whipsaws.

- macd
  What it measures: MACD line (momentum) via differences of EMAs; helps identify momentum shifts.
  How to use: MACD crossing above/below zero and divergences with price can signal trend changes. Best used with trend context and other filters.

- macds
  What it measures: MACD signal line (the EMA of MACD); smooths MACD for trade triggers.
  How to use: Crossovers of MACD and MACDS provide buy/sell signals; combine with price action and RSI to reduce false positives.

- rsi
  What it measures: Relative strength index; momentum/overbought-oversold pressure.
  How to use: Traditional thresholds 70/30. In strong uptrends, RSI can remain overbought; watch for bearish/bullish divergence with price as a warning sign.

- boll
  What it measures: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a volatility-normalized baseline; basis for bands.
  How to use: Use with upper/lower bands to spot breakout or mean-reversion opportunities. Breakouts beyond the bands in conjunction with trend direction can indicate momentum surges; conversely, tests near the middle band can indicate pullbacks.

- atr
  What it measures: Average True Range; market volatility level.
  How to use: Helps set position sizing and stop-loss distances. Higher ATR implies wider stops; lower ATR implies tighter stops. Useful to calibrate risk management in tandem with targets from price action and momentum.

Notes on how to interpret this combo for AAPL
- Trend confirmation: Look for price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA to confirm a bullish setup; a cross of 50 SMA above 200 SMA strengthens a multi-timeframe uptrend signal.
- Momentum checks: Use MACD and MACDS in tandem with RSI to confirm momentum shifts; a positive MACD/histogram alongside RSI not in overbought territory provides a more robust entry signal.
- Reversion vs breakout: Boll middle serves as a reference; sustained price action outside the bands with rising ATR suggests a breakout scenario rather than a quick mean-reversion spike.
- Risk controls: Use ATR to scale stops; if ATR is high, widen stops to avoid being prematurely stopped out in volatile regimes; if ATR is contracting, trailing stops can tighten.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch and then generate a detailed, data-driven trend report with observations from AAPL as of 2025-10-25, using the 8 indicators listed above.
- Alternatively, I can provide a scenario-based analysis (e.g., “if price is above 50/200 SMA with MACD rising and RSI around 55-65, it suggests…”) if you prefer.

Markdown table: Key indicators and their purpose
| Indicator | What it measures | How to use for AAPL (trend/momentum/volatility context) |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day moving average; medium-term trend | Determines intermediate trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; use with longer-term trend for signal filtering. |
| close_200_sma | 200-day moving average; long-term trend benchmark | Confirms overall market direction; golden/death cross signals potential major regime shifts. |
| close_10_ema | 10-day exponential moving average; short-term momentum | Captures quick momentum shifts; watch for crossovers with price and longer averages for timing. |
| macd | MACD line; momentum indicator | Signals momentum changes via crossovers and divergences; confirm with other tools in choppy markets. |
| macds | MACD signal line; smoothed momentum | Trade triggers when MACD crosses MACDS; use with price action and trend context to reduce false positives. |
| rsi | Relative Strength Index; momentum and overbought/oversold | 70/30 thresholds; watch for divergences; context important in strong trends. |
| boll | Bollinger Middle (20 SMA); volatility baseline | Baseline for price movement; combine with bands to spot breakouts or reversals. |
| atr | Average True Range; volatility magnitude | Sets risk management rules (stops, position sizing) based on current volatility. |

What would you like me to do next?
- Retry the data fetch now and then deliver a detailed, data-driven trend report?
- Or proceed with a scenario-based interpretation using these indicators as if current data were available?
