Apologies—the Reddit stock info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. I can retry immediately, or wait a moment and try again, or proceed with an alternate plan if you’d prefer. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll proceed once I can fetch data, plus a concrete plan and a placeholder table you can review.

What I can do next (once the data fetch works)
- Pull the latest Reddit sentiment data for NFLX for 2025-10-25 and aggregate sentiment day-by-day over the past week.
- Synthesize recent NFLX news (earnings, content partnerships, subscriber trends, price moves) and align sentiment with headlines.
- Deliver a comprehensive narrative with fine-grained insights for traders (e.g., which days showed sentiment spikes, what news or events drove reactions, potential precedents for price moves).
- Append a clear Markdown table at the end summarizing key points and signals.

If you’d like me to retry right now, I’ll run another fetch immediately and begin compiling the analysis as soon as data returns.

Proposed structure of the full report (to be delivered after data is retrieved)

Notes and next steps
- I’ll revert with a full, data-backed long report as soon as the Reddit data fetch succeeds. If you’d prefer, I can also pull any additional sources you specify (e.g., Twitter/X, news wires, company press releases) once I have access to a suitable toolset.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with a plan to gather alternative sources in parallel while we wait?
