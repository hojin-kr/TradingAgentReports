Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch the data and run the indicators, but I hit a data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data source for NFLX over 2024-10-25 to 2025-10-25. I can retry immediately or proceed with a thorough, methodical framework based on the chosen indicators and how they would apply to NFLX in typical market conditions. Please tell me if you want me to retry now. In the meantime, here is a detailed, nuanced framework and rationale using the eight selected indicators (8 total) to cover trend, momentum, volatility, and breakout context for NFLX.

What I would look at (indicators chosen and why)
Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll_ub
- atr

Why these are complementary
- Trend and direction: 50 SMA and 200 SMA give a medium- and long-term trend baseline. 50SMA above 200SMA (golden cross) supports bullish bias; the reverse supports bearish bias. The 10 EMA adds a responsive, short-term read on momentum and potential early entry points.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and MACD Signal (macd and macds) provide crossovers and divergence signals to corroborate trend strength or waning momentum. Together with RSI, you get a balanced read on price momentum (speed, not just direction).
- Momentum/overbought-oversold context: RSI flags potential reversals or continuations when prices stretch. In strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated; in downtrends it can stay depressed—so use it with trend context.
- Breakout/volatility context: Bollinger Upper Band (boll_ub) helps identify potential breakout zones or overbought conditions when price hugs or rides the upper band. It’s useful for spotting momentum-driven moves and potential pullback risk after a peak.
- Volatility sizing and risk management: ATR (atr) informs average true range, helpful for stop placement and position sizing in line with current volatility.

How to interpret these indicators for NFLX (contextual guidance)
Note: Since I don’t have the actual current data due to the retrieval error, treat the interpretations as guidance you can apply once the data is available. When you re-run, you’ll plug NFLX data into these eight indicators and compare against the scenarios below.

1) Trend framework (50SMA, 200SMA, 10EMA)
- Bullish scenario:
  - Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA.
  - 50SMA above 200SMA (golden cross context or persistent uptrend).
  - 10EMA trending above price or crossing upward through price for a potential pullback entry direction.
- Bearish scenario:
  - Price below both 50SMA and 200SMA; 50SMA trending below 200SMA (death cross territory).
  - 10EMA failing to hold prices or crossing southward as momentum weakens.

2) Momentum confirmation (macd, macds)
- MACD line crossing above MACD Signal with expansion suggests bullish momentum; consider long entries aligned with trend support.
- MACD crossing below Signal with expansion indicates bearish momentum; look for short setups or protection in long positions.
- Divergences between price and MACD can precede reversals; combine with RSI to filter.

3) RSI (momentum strength)
- RSI in rising trend but not extreme (>70) supports sustainable upside.
- RSI approaching overbought zones (>70) in a clear uptrend warrants caution; look for bullish continuation signals with MACD alignment or potential pullback signals.
- RSI under 30 in a downtrend suggests oversold conditions; may anticipate bounce if trend confirms.

4) Bollinger Upper Band (boll_ub) and volatility context
- Price trading near or above Bollinger Upper Band with widening bands and rising ATR supports strong momentum, but increases risk of short-term pullback or consolidation.
- If price hits the upper band but MACD and RSI show weakness or divergence, expect potential mean reversion or consolidation.

5) ATR (volatility)
- Rising ATR indicates increasing volatility, which supports wider stop placement and potentially larger price swings (beneficial for risk management).
- Declining ATR indicates contraction; tighter stops may be appropriate and breakouts may be less volatile.

Trading/no-trade implications for NFLX (decision framework)
- Favor longs when:
  - Price above 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA, MACD above signal and rising, RSI not overbought, and price near or touching the upper Boll band with ATR showing manageable to rising volatility.
  - 10EMA acts as a dynamic entry trigger if it turns upward and price re-tests a nearby support (moving average or prior swing low).
- Be cautious on longs when:
  - Price weakens below key moving averages, MACD turns negative or bearish cross occurs, RSI breaks below 50 from above, or price sits at the upper Boll band while MACD and RSI show fading momentum.
  - ATR is rising rapidly with no clear price breakout, indicating potential whipsaws or abrupt reversals.
- Shorts (if used) when:
  - Price breaks below 50SMA and/or 200SMA with MACD bearish crossover, RSI weakening toward oversold, or price riding the upper band while momentum falters and ATR increases.

Risk management and practical use
- Use ATR to set stop-loss bands: a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.5x to 2x) away from the entry to account for current volatility.
- Confirm entries with a confluence of signals: trend direction (SMA cross), momentum (MACD, RSI), and volatility (ATR and Boll band context) to reduce false positives.
- Consider time horizon: longer-term trend via 50SMA/200SMA for swing/position trades; 10EMA for shorter-term timing.
- Earnings/meeting risk: Netflix-specific catalysts (earnings, content slate, subscriber growth, price changes) tend to drive sharp moves; ensure risk controls are in place around such events.

What to expect once data is available
- You’ll get a snapshot of the current state of each indicator for NFLX, enabling precise assessments of the scenarios above (e.g., “Golden cross confirmed, MACD bullish, RSI 55, upper Boll band being tested, ATR rising”).
- You can then translate that into concrete entry/exit ideas or a trading plan aligned with your risk tolerance.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now and then generate a synchronized indicator readout for NFLX if you’d like. If you prefer, I can proceed with just the qualitative framework above or tailor it to a specific time horizon (intraday, swing, or multi-week). Please tell me:
  - Do you want me to retry the data pull for NFLX now?
  - If yes, should I use the same date range, or a shorter window (e.g., last 90-180 days) to ensure data availability?
