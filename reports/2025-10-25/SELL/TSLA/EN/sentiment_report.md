Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch TSLA Reddit stock news for 2025-10-25, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I tried twice, and the issue persisted. Because the analysis hinges on up-to-date social sentiment, I don’t want to improvise data.

What I can do right now
- Acknowledge the tool outage and outline exactly how I’ll proceed as soon as the data fetch works.
- Provide a thorough framework and a well-structured long report once I have the Reddit data and any accompanying news feeds.

Proposed next steps
1) Retry data fetch now
- I can re-attempt to pull the latest Reddit stock info for TSLA for 2025-10-25. If the tool works, I’ll produce a comprehensive long report with:
  - Day-by-day sentiment and volume on Reddit related to TSLA for the past week
  - Top themes and sentiment drivers (e.g., production updates, price actions, EV demand, AI/robotaxi chatter, cyber/FT issues, leadership commentary)
  - Notable posts, influencer signals, and potential clusters of bullish/bearish consensus
  - Correlation with price action and notable news events from the same window
  - Risk factors and potential catalysts for the near term
  - Trader-oriented insights: potential entry/exit ideas, risk management notes, and scenarios
  - A final Markdown table summarizing key points

2) If you’d prefer, I can proceed without live Reddit data
- I can still draft a robust TSLA sentiment/news report using a best-effort synthesis of typical themes seen recently in public discourse (without claiming to be current), clearly labeled as offline synthesis. I would explicitly note the data gap and provide conservative, non-committal insights until live data is available.
- I would then queue the live data fetch for when the tool is fixed and update the report accordingly.

What would you like to do?
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and proceed with the full, data-backed report as soon as it succeeds.
- Option B: I proceed with the offline synthesis and placeholder insights, then update with live data once the tool is working.
- Option C: You provide an alternate data source (if you have access to another sentiment feed), and I’ll integrate it.

If you want me to retry immediately, say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt the data fetch again and begin the full, detailed report once the tool responds.
