Apologies — I tried to fetch TSLA data, but the data retrieval tool is currently returning a file-not-found error. I can proceed in two ways:
- Wait and retry shortly to pull TSLA price data and then generate a full, data-driven trend report.
- Or proceed with a structured indicator framework now (no data yet) so you can review the approach and I’ll fill in the actual observations as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators (complementary, non-redundant) and why they’re suitable for TSLA given its typical characteristics (high volatility, strong macro/EV sector drivers, and rapid sentiment shifts). Once data is available, I’ll deliver a detailed, granular trend report with concrete observations.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps assess whether TSLA is in a sustained uptrend or not and provides a baseline against which to measure shorter-term moves.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming the overarching market regime (golden/death cross considerations) and smoothing out shorter-term noise.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Why: More responsive short-term momentum. Helps identify quick shifts in price action and potential entry/exit points when used with longer-term SMAs.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Core momentum indicator. Crossover dynamics between MACD line and signal line help signal potential trend changes, especially when price action is consolidating.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: MACD signal line. Crossovers with the MACD line add confirmation to potential entries/exits and help filter false signals.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: MACD histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and can reveal divergences early, adding nuance to MACD cross signals.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Why: Momentum momentum gauge for overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Divergence with price can indicate weakening momentum even in uptrends.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Why: Measures current price volatility magnitude. Critical for setting stop-loss distances and sizing, especially for TSLA’s volatile moves.

Rationale for this set
- Diversified view: The combination covers trend (SMA), momentum (MACD family and RSI), volatility (ATR), and a responsive short-term view (10 EMA) without relying on too many similar signals.
- Redundancy avoidance: I avoided duplicating similar momentum measures (e.g., multiple RSI variants) and kept a balance among trend, momentum, and volatility.
- TSLA context: TSLA often exhibits rapid sentiment-driven moves and elevated volatility. ATR helps quantify risk and adapt stops, while MACD and RSI help identify momentum-driven entry/exit opportunities in conjunction with trend indicators (SMA crossovers).

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed trend report for TSLA that includes:
  - Current price relative to 50-SMA and 200-SMA (trend regime).
  - Recent crossovers of 10-EMA with price and/or with the SMAs.
  - MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram signals and any divergences.
  - RSI level and any notable divergences against price.
  - ATR level and recent volatility context (e.g., expansion vs contraction, impact on stop levels).
  - A concise reading on potential bullish/bearish setups with supporting conditions.
  - Risk considerations and suggested optional exits/entries based on the indicators.

Proposed interpretation framework for TSLA (generic guidance I’ll apply with actual data)
- If price holds above 50-SMA and 200-SMA with a bullish MACD cross and rising MACD histogram, consider a bullish bias, with RSI confirming momentum (not overbought) and ATR indicating manageable volatility for a potential entry.
- If price tests or breaks below 50-SMA while 200-SMA remains flat or turns downward, with MACD turning negative and RSI dropping toward oversold, approach cautiously and consider risk controls (ATR-based stops, tighter position sizing).
- If ATR is elevated with price choppy and MACD/MACD Signal showing mixed signals, rely more on SMA positioning and RSI to avoid whipsaws; consider reducing position size or awaiting clearer momentum.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now or after a short delay. Please tell me:
  - Do you want me to retry automatically in a few minutes, or would you prefer I wait for your go-ahead?
  - If you’d like, I can also expand the indicator set by including Bollinger bands (boll, boll_ub, boll_lb) or VWMA if you want a different flavor of trend/volume confirmation.

Markdown table: Key indicators and roles
- Indicator | Category | What to watch for | What a bullish signal would look like | What a bearish signal would look like
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Price relative to 50-SMA; crossovers | Price above 50-SMA with rising slope, and price crossing above 50-SMA on pullback | Price crossing below 50-SMA or falling back through it
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend direction | Price above 200-SMA indicating uptrend; golden cross (50-SMA above 200-SMA) strengthens bullish bias | Price below 200-SMA indicating potential downtrend; death cross (50-SMA below 200-SMA) strengthens bearish bias
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum, quick shifts | Price stays above 10-EMA with ongoing positive momentum; crossing above nearby resistance | Price dips below 10-EMA; momentum turns negative
- macd | MACD | Momentum trend changes | MACD line crosses above Signal line with positive histogram | MACD line crosses below Signal line with negative histogram
- macds | MACD Signal | Confirmation of MACD signal | Cross of MACD above Signal corroborates bullish move | Cross of MACD below Signal corroborates bearish move
- macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Histogram rising (positive and growing) supports bullish momentum | Histogram falling (negative and expanding) supports bearish momentum
- rsi | Momentum | O/B thresholds and divergence | RSI rising toward 70 but not overbought; bullish divergence with price | RSI failing to sustain momentum or falling toward/through 30; bearish divergence
- atr | Volatility | Current volatility magnitude | Rising ATR with price action confirming a breakout/scaling move; allows wider stops | Elevated ATR with no follow-through; riskier environment; consider tighter controls

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and then deliver a full, data-driven TSLA trend report with precise observations as soon as the data comes back. Just say “retry now” and I’ll proceed.
