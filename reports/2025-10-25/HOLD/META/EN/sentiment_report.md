Sorry—I'm hitting an internal tool error retrieving Reddit data right now. The get_reddit_stock_info call is returning a FileNotFoundError. I can try again, or we can proceed with a sentiment-and-news analysis using other sources (if you’re okay with that limitation) and note that Reddit data wasn’t available this cycle.

What would you like to do?
- Retry fetching Reddit data now (META, date 2025-10-25)
- Try again with a different date/ticker (e.g., META today)
- Proceed with a best-effort analysis using other public sources (news headlines, official earnings, press releases) and clearly mark the Reddit data gap

If you want me to proceed with the non-Reddit route, I’ll compile a thorough, trader-focused report on Meta (META) covering:
- Latest company news and catalysts from the past week
- Public sentiment signals from non-Reddit sources (e.g., mainstream outlets, earnings commentary)
- Potential implications for traders (short-term catalysts, risk factors, positioning)
- A detailed, fine-grained analysis with practical takeaways
- A concluding Markdown table summarizing key points and actionable items

Please tell me which path you’d prefer.
