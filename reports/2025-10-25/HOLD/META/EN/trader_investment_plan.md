Recommendation: Hold META.

Rationale
- Near-term concerns: Hyperion capex and financing terms create margin and cash-flow headwinds. EU regulatory risk remains material and can affect monetization and costs.
- Medium-term view: META’s moat is sizable and AI-enabled monetization could unlock upside, but this hinges on faster-than-expected margin expansion and efficient capital deployment.
- Risk-reward balance: The plan you shared articulates a balanced stance—positive long-run catalysts but meaningful near-term drag. A Hold preserves exposure to the AI-growth thesis while guarding against premature upside being priced in.

Strategic actions for a Hold
- Positioning and risk controls
  - Maintain neutral exposure relative to your benchmark; implement hedges to protect on downside.
  - Implement an ATR-based stop framework with a maximum drawdown cap of about 5-7% per downside test; use trailing stops as price action validates the thesis.
- Hedging ideas
  - Consider downside hedges around catalysts (e.g., long puts vs. META or collar strategies) to limit downside while retaining upside optionality if monetization accelerates.
  - Use calendar/diagonal spreads around earnings or regulatory milestones to capture time decay on overhang risk and preserve upside if catalysts materialize.
- Catalyst-driven playbook (earnings/regulatory milestones)
  - Pre-earnings/regulatory updates: define sensitivity bands for guidance changes.
  - If monetization signs improve and margins start to stabilize or rise, you can move toward a modest overweight stance.
  - If Hyperion pace/margins worsen or EU risk intensifies, trim risk exposure, tighten hedges, or move toward a more defensive stance.
- Data-driven validation plan (when data available)
  - If data is available, apply a structured eight-indicator framework (50SMA/200SMA, 10-EMA, MACD, MACD histogram, RSI, ATR) to identify regime shifts and entry/exit signals.
  - Look for confluence of trend strength (price above moving averages, positive MACD, constructive RSI) versus risk signals (overbought RSI, negative MACD, rising ATR).
  - Use signals to time partial addbacks if the data supports a constructive setup; otherwise maintain Hold with hedges until clearer data supports a shift.
- Earnings and regulatory testing plan
  - In the absence of fresh data, rely on scenario-based planning around the next earnings print and EU updates. If data arrives, run the eight-indicator analysis to guide a probabilistic Buy/Trim/Protect decision.
- Learning from past decisions
  - Avoid hype without a risk overlay; treat regulatory risk as ongoing and adjust risk premia accordingly; verify moat durability with measurable monetization progress before escalating exposure; stick to disciplined risk-management rules.

Next steps
- If you want, I can pull the latest data and run the eight-indicator framework now to assess whether a more constructive stance becomes warranted.
- Alternatively, I can stick with this Hold plan and provide a data-informed update around the next META catalyst.
