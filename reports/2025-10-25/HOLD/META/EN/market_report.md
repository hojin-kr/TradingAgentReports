I attempted to fetch META data and generate the requested indicators, but data retrieval failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the data source. I can’t compute current values or produce a trend-driven, numerically grounded report without the CSV. If you can re-run the data pull or provide the CSV, I’ll deliver the full, data-driven analysis immediately. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators (up to 8) with rationale and a framework for META, plus next steps.

Selected indicators (complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these eight
- close_50_sma: Captures the mid-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for identifying ongoing directional bias for META.
- close_200_sma: Provides a long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm whether META is in a broader uptrend or downtrend; useful for filtering entries in alignment with the major trend.
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum gauge. Helps detect quick shifts in price action around key trend levels, useful for entries or quick exits when used with the longer-term averages.
- macd: Core momentum indicator showing differences between two EMAs. Crossovers and histogram behavior help confirm trend changes in conjunction with price action.
- macds: The MACD signal line; its cross with the MACD line provides more reliable entry/exit triggers when combined with other signals.
- macdh: MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and can reveal divergence early. Aids in gauging the sustainability of moves flagged by MACD.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator signaling overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Useful when aligning momentum with trend direction to avoid premature counter-trend plays.
- atr: Measures volatility, aiding risk management: stop levels, position sizing, and adapting to regime shifts (e.g., higher ATR during breakouts or news-driven moves).

How these indicators would inform META trading decisions (framework, once data is available)
- Trend confirmation:
  - If close_50_sma is above close_200_sma, bias is bullish; look for MACD to stay above zero and MACD line crossing above MACD signal to add exposure on pullbacks to the 50SMA or 10-EMA confluences.
  - If close_50_sma is below close_200_sma, bias is bearish; look for MACD to stay below zero and MACD line crossing below MACD signal to consider exits or short exposure on rallies that fail to clear major resistance.
- Momentum and timing:
  - MACD crossovers (MACD above MACD_s or MACD crossing MACD_s upwards) support entries with a rising MACD histogram (MACDH > 0) confirming momentum strength; watch for RSI confirming momentum (e.g., rising RSI without being overbought).
  - MACDH divergence (e.g., price making new highs while MACD histogram fails to) can warn about weakening momentum; consider reducing risk or awaiting a MACD/RSI confluence before continuing.
- Volume and volatility considerations (indirectly via ATR and price action around MA levels):
  - ATR rising with price breaking above resistance or moving averages can indicate a new trend leg with higher risk; adjust stops and position size accordingly.
  - Use RSI in tandem with trend signals: an uptrend with RSI approaching overbought (e.g., >70) may suggest taking partial profits or tightening stops rather than initiating new long positions unless MACD shows robust momentum.
- Risk management:
  - Use ATR to set dynamic stop-loss buffers around entries signaled by MA confluence and MACD/MSDH signals.
  - If volatility contracts (lower ATR) while price remains range-bound, prioritize tighter risk controls and wait for a clearer breakout signal from MACD and RSI.

Recommended usage and interpretation guide (practical notes)
- Combine signals to avoid overtrading:
  - Favor long entries only when: 50SMA > 200SMA, MACD > 0 with MACDS crossing upward, MACDH rising, RSI climbing but not overbought, and ATR showing acceptable expansion consistent with a breakout move.
  - Consider short entries only when: 50SMA < 200SMA, MACD < 0 with MACDS crossing downward, MACDH dropping, RSI confirming momentum in the bear direction, and ATR indicating rising volatility on a downside breakout.
- Be mindful of market regime shifts:
  - In choppy or range-bound regimes, rely more on MA crossovers and MACD signal confirmation with RSI staying neutral (not extreme) and ATR relatively stable.
  - In trending regimes, let price breakouts and MACD/RSI momentum carry positions, but use ATR to manage risk and avoid oversized positions on news-driven spikes.

Next steps
- If you can re-run the data pull (or supply the CSV), I will deliver:
  - A precise, data-driven trend assessment for META over 2024-10-25 to 2025-10-25.
  - Current indicator values, signal flags, and a set of actionable trade ideas (entries, exits, stops, sizing) using the eight indicators above.
  - A detailed narrative of trend strength, potential reversals, and risk considerations specific to META.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative framework using the same indicator set and provide example signal rules without numeric current values until the data is available.

- Typical signal interpretation (long/short bias or caution)

| Indicator | Purpose | META Context Utility | Typical Signal Interpretation (when aligned with others) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Mid-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Defines medium-term trend direction; complements long-term view | Price above/below 50SMA indicates bullish/bearish bias; use with 200SMA for confirmation |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms overarching trend and major regime | 50SMA above/below 200SMA suggests golden/death cross potential; guides strategic bias |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum/fine-tuning | Captures quick shifts, aids entry timing | Price crossing above/below 10EMA signals short-term momentum; confirm with longer-term indicators |
| macd | Momentum/trend-change gauge | Core signal of momentum direction/strength | MACD crossing zero or MACD above/below signal confirms trend impulse direction |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoother trigger for MACD-based entries | MACDS cross with MACD provides a more reliable entry/exit cue |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength visualization | Rising MACDH supports sustained moves; negative/slow histogram warns of fading momentum |
| rsi | Momentum overbought/oversold | Helps gauge pace and potential reversals | RSI moving toward overbought/oversold with trend alignment offers caution on entries |
| atr | Volatility/risk management | Guides stops, sizing, and regime shifts | Rising ATR implies larger price moves; adjust stops and position size accordingly |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now or wait for you to provide the dataset. Once I have the data, I’ll deliver a full, data-backed trend report and concrete trade ideas based on the eight indicators listed.
