Data retrieval hiccup
- I attempted to fetch AMD data and the related indicators, but the data source returned a FileNotFoundError. This suggests the Yahoo/YFin data service or the local data bridge is temporarily unavailable. I can try again shortly or proceed with a qualitative framework now and re-run the data fetch as soon as the service is back.

Proposed approach now
- Since we don’t have the actual numeric data scraped at hand, I’ll provide a detailed, nuanced framework using the eight selected indicators. Once the data fetch is successful, we can plug in the latest values and refine the actionable signals.

Selected indicators (8) and rationale
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  - What it provides: medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level.
  - AMD context: helps confirm whether the stock is in a sustained uptrend or not. In a rising market, price often tests the 50SMA as support.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  - What it provides: long-term trend benchmark; used to identify major trend regime (bullish if price remains above, bearish if below).
  - AMD context: important for strategic bias; a golden cross-like dynamic (price above 200SMA) would support a longer-term bullish stance, while sustained price below signals caution.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  - What it provides: responsive short-term momentum and potential entry timing.
  - AMD context: helps spot quicker shifts in momentum around earnings cycles, product cycle news, or AI demand catalysts.
- macd: MACD line
  - What it provides: momentum and trend-change signals via crossovers and divergences.
  - AMD context: useful to confirm a trend change when price is near key levels or around a product/earnings catalyst.
- macds: MACD Signal line
  - What it provides: smoothed momentum signal; crossovers with MACD line trigger potential entries/exits.
  - AMD context: helps filter MACD cross signals, reducing false positives in choppy markets.
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  - What it provides: momentum strength; positive/expanding histogram supports bullish momentum; negative/contracting supports bearish momentum.
  - AMD context: divergence with price or turning points in histogram can precede price moves, especially around major catalysts.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index
  - What it provides: momentum gauge and overbought/oversold conditions with potential reversals.
  - AMD context: in strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; watch for bearish/bullish divergences with price and cross-check with trend indicators.
- atr: Average True Range
  - What it provides: volatility magnitude; informs stop placement and position sizing.
  - AMD context: elevated ATR around earnings or AI demand news implies wider stops and careful risk management; lower ATR during consolidation means tighter risk controls.

How to read and act once data is loaded
- Bullish alignment (confluence of signals)
  - Price above 50SMA and 200SMA; 50SMA above 200SMA or price firmly above both.
  - Price crossing above 10EMA with MACD above its signal and histogram rising.
  - RSI trending up but not in extreme overbought territory; ATR rising modestly indicating healthy volatility without excessive risk.
  - Action: look for pullbacks toward the 10EMA or 50SMA as potential entries; use ATR for stop placement (e.g., 1.0–2.0 ATR from entry) and position sizing to match risk tolerance.

- Bearish alignment (confluence of signals)
  - Price below 50SMA and 200SMA; 50SMA crossing below 200SMA (or price staying under both).
  - MACD below its signal with negative histogram; MACD failing to reclaim zero.
  - RSI trending down, potentially approaching oversold, but watch for continued momentum if the trend remains intact.
  - ATR rising with downside moves indicating increasing volatility; support levels near the 200SMA may break.
  - Action: consider protective/sell-side strategies or wait for a clearer uptrend re-entry; if trading short, use tight stops with ATR-based sizing.

- Sideways/rotation scenario
  - Price oscillating around the 50SMA while price stays near the 200SMA; MACD oscillating around zero; RSI in mid-range; ATR relatively subdued.
  - Action: range-trading approach with defined support/resistance; avoid over-leveraged entries; use tight stops.

AMD-specific context to watch (high-level, non-numeric)
- Key drivers likely to influence AMD in this period include AI/data-center GPU demand, product roadmaps for GPUs/Accelerators, competitive dynamics with Nvidia and others, supply chain resilience, and earnings cadence. Breakouts or pullbacks often hinge on catalysts such as new product announcements, AI-related adoption by cloud providers, or changes in supply/demand dynamics.
- Given the volatility around major semiconductor cycles, especially around earnings events or AI industry developments, range expansion (high ATR) can occur quickly; risk controls and flexible sizing are essential.

Proposed actions (summary)
- Use the eight indicators together to form a multi-faceted view: trend (50SMA/200SMA), momentum (10EMA, MACD family, RSI), and volatility (ATR). This reduces reliance on any single signal and helps avoid whipsaws.
- Favor signals that align across multiple indicators (e.g., price above major moving averages + MACD positive + RSI not in extreme overbought zone) for entries.
- For risk management, base stops on ATR to adapt to current volatility, and adjust position size accordingly.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation
Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AMD | Suggested action
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance | Price above suggests uptrend; price below hints at resistance or consolidation | Look for pullbacks toward 50SMA as potential entries in uptrends; use as a guide for trend-following bias
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above indicates long-term bullish context; below indicates bearish context | Use as strategic filter; consider longer-term bias and scenario planning
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum and timing | Quick shifts in momentum; supports entry timing around catalysts | Look for crossovers with price or with 50SMA/200SMA as entry timing signals
- macd | Momentum and trend-change signals | Crosses above zero and rising histogram indicate momentum buildup; cross below may signal weakness | Use as a core momentum filter; confirm with other indicators
- macds | MACD Signal line crossover | MACD crossing above signal strengthens bullish stance; crossing below weakens | Filter MACD signals to reduce false positives
- macdh | MACD Histogram momentum strength | Expanding positive histogram shows strengthening bullish momentum; negative/contracting suggests weakening | Watch for divergences with price; use for confirming trend shifts
- rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold conditions | Rising RSI supports upside bias; extreme readings (>70) require caution; declines toward 30-40 can signal reversal | Use with trend context; beware of false reversals in strong trends
- atr | Market volatility | Higher ATR indicates wider daily ranges; lower ATR implies consolidation | Use for stop placement and position sizing; increase risk controls around earnings/major events

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now and apply these indicators to generate concrete signals (entries, exits, stops) based on the latest AMD data. Please confirm if you want me to retry immediately, or proceed with this qualitative framework and revisit once data is back online.

Note: If you have a preferred date range or want to include a different set of up-to-8 indicators, I can adjust the selection accordingly.
