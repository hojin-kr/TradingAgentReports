Recommendation: Hold AMD.

Rationale
- The proposed plan correctly flags the core risks: Nvidia’s dominance for AI GPUs, cyclical and lumpy AI capex, and potential margin pressures if AI mix doesn’t translate into durable backlog and ASP uplift. 
- While the bull case (data-center AI demand, platform ecosystem, cross-sell potential) remains credible, there isn’t yet durable, repeatable evidence of backlog growth or margin expansion that would justify a stronger stance.
- Near-term catalysts are uncertain. The risk-reward favors maintaining capital preservation and waiting for clearer, verifiable upside signals rather than pushing into a new long outright.

What could move us to Buy
- Several consecutive quarters of durable backlog growth tied to AI compute, with confirmed ASP uplift and measurable margin expansion driven by higher-value AI mix.
- Recurrent enterprise/cloud deals that translate into repeatable revenue, not headlines, plus corroborating product-cycle milestones with tangible backlog and utilization metrics.
- Technical confirmation: sustained price action above key moving averages with improving momentum and narrowing volatility.

What could move us to Sell
- Sustained backlog stagnation, no margin uplift from AI mix, or dilutive pricing pressure that fails to improve gross margins; a failure to translate product cadence into recurring revenue and backlog within a couple of quarters.
- Break of meaningful support levels with negative momentum around earnings or key product updates.

Practical steps (if you’re currently long)
- Trim incremental risk rather than exiting fully; avoid overweight exposure until catalysts materialize.
- If flat, wait for a clearer probabilistic edge before initiating a sizable long.
- Maintain risk controls (stop references, position sizing in the 1–2% range for new add-ons) and consider hedging near earnings or major product milestones.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
