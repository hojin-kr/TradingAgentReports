Recommendation: Hold

Rationale:
- The plan you shared aligns with a cautious stance: wait for multi-quarter, corroborated evidence of durable commercial ARR growth and meaningful margin leverage before committing more capital.
- Pros to watch: credible catalysts (commercial ARR expansion, Lumen, Snowflake ecosystem, improving mix) that could lift margins and turn Foundry/AIP into a more durable revenue engine.
- Cons/challenges: profitability at scale not proven yet; margins depend on commercial mix and onboarding efficiency; high valuation remains a risk if ARR growth proves uneven; regulatory/governance headlines add risk premium and could compress multiples if concerns persist.

Upgrade triggers (what would convince us to buy):
- Consecutive quarters of sustained commercial ARR growth with a clear, improving trajectory.
- Gross margin expansion and evidence of operating leverage from a higher commercial mix.
- Demonstrable ecosystem wins translating to recurring revenue, plus reduced regulatory/headwind risk (e.g., disclosures or settlements that lower risk premium).
- Evidence of free cash flow inflection or improving cash generation as deals scale.

Actionable approach:
- Maintain current exposure with a staged entry mindset if you’re underexposed; avoid aggressive adds until fundamentals confirm a durable uptrend.
- If you’re already long, treat additions as contingent on constructive quarterly data rather than headlines.

If you want, I can pull the latest price action, moving-average/RSI/MMACD context, and updated ARR/margin signals to produce a precise upgrade/downgrade signal tied to the thresholds above.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
