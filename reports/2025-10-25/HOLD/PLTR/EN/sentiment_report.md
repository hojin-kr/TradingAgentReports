Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to pull Reddit sentiment data for PLTR across 2025-10-25 to 2025-10-19 in parallel, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all requests. Because of this, I can’t provide the day-by-day Reddit sentiment digests right now.

What I can do now
- Proceed with a plan to deliver a thorough PLTR analysis using other sources (e.g., company news, earnings, partnerships, AI product updates, regulatory/compliance signals, and general market sentiment) while we wait for the Reddit data tool to come back online.
- If you’d like, I can retry the Reddit data fetch shortly, or you can specify alternative data sources you want me to prioritize.

Proposed approach (pending Reddit data)
- Sentiment data sources: Reddit (when available), other social channels (Twitter/X, stock forums), and official company communications (press releases, 8-Ks, investor presentations).
- Key metrics to track daily/weekly once data is available:
  - Net sentiment score (positive minus negative posts)
  - Posting volume and velocity
  - Top sentiment themes (AI, government contracts, product updates, valuation concerns)
  - Potential price-theoretic signals (short-term sentiment spikes vs price action)
- Complementary factors to monitor (without Reddit data):
  - Company news: quarterly results, revenue mix (government vs commercial), margin trajectory, free cash flow, and guidance
  - AI/product updates: new integrations, feature releases, partnerships, or customer wins outside the government sector
  - Macro/sector signals: AI adoption cycles, defense/government procurement sentiment, regulatory developments, competitive dynamics (e.g., cloud/data-privacy considerations)
  - Technicals: price range, recent breakout/breakdown levels, volume clusters, and moving averages (to contextualize sentiment signals)

What I can deliver once data is available
- A comprehensive long-form report detailing:
  - A synthesized sentiment view across social channels and news
  - The latest company news and how it aligns with sentiment
  - Daily/weekly sentiment deltas and notable drivers
  - The interplay between sentiment and fundamentals (earnings trajectory, contract momentum, margin expansion)
  - Trader-oriented implications: potential entry/exit signals, risk flags, and scenario analysis
  - A compact Markdown table at the end summarizing key points for quick reference

Would you like me to:
1) Retry fetching the Reddit data now, or
2) Proceed immediately with a qualitative, source-agnostic analysis using other available data (news, company disclosures, market context), and we populate Reddit sentiment once the tool is back online?

If you want me to proceed with option 2 right away, I’ll start compiling the framework and a detailed narrative, then fill in the Reddit-driven insights as soon as the tool becomes available.

Markdown table (structure placeholder)
Note: This table is designed to be filled with Reddit sentiment data and key observations once the data fetch is successful.

| Date | Source | Sentiment (Net) | Top Themes | Notable News / Events | Potential Implication for PLTR | Suggested Trading Note |
|------|--------|------------------|------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| 2025-10-25 | Reddit (pending) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 2025-10-24 | Reddit (pending) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 2025-10-23 | Reddit (pending) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 2025-10-22 | Reddit (pending) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 2025-10-21 | Reddit (pending) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 2025-10-20 | Reddit (pending) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 2025-10-19 | Reddit (pending) | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

If you want me to proceed now with the qualitative analysis (no Reddit data yet), just say “Proceed with qualitative analysis,” and I’ll deliver a thorough narrative focusing on fundamentals, news flow, and broader sentiment signals, with the table ready to be populated as soon as Reddit data returns.
