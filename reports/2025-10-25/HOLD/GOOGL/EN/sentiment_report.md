Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull the latest Reddit sentiment for GOOGL today, but the Reddit stock-info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch the day-by-day social sentiment data right now. I don’t want to provide you with incorrect or incomplete numbers. Here’s how I can proceed to keep moving the analysis forward, along with a concrete plan and a structured report you can use once the data tool is back online.

What I can do now
- Provide a robust framework for a deep-dive report that you can rely on, clearly distinguishing data-backed signals from methodology and expectations.
- Outline the key data points I would extract (and how I’d interpret them) once the tool is available again.
- Deliver a ready-to-fill Markdown table template at the end, so you can drop in the actual numbers as soon as the data comes in.

Proposed plan (what I’ll deliver once data is accessible)
1) Social media sentiment analysis (last 7 days)
   - Daily sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative) for GOOGL on major Reddit threads and sentiment buckets.
   - Volume trends: number of posts/comments mentioning GOOGL, rate of new posts, and notable spikes.
   - Thematic drivers: AI updates, ad market signals, cloud/comms news, regulatory chatter, leadership commentary, product announcements (YouTube, Pixel, Google Cloud).
   - Top subreddits and post-level sentiment signals (qualitative themes with quantitative framing where possible).

2) Public news and corporate headlines (last 7 days)
   - Summary of major Google/Alphabet disclosures, earnings context (if any), product launches, partnership announcements, regulatory developments, antitrust updates, leadership changes.
   - Market reaction to each headline (immediate price/volatility response, if available, and sentiment framing).

3) Synthesis for traders
   - Identify near-term catalysts (earnings timing, product launches, regulatory decisions) and their sentiment implications.
   - Key risk signals (regulatory headwinds, AI moat competition, ad revenue sensitivity, capex/predictability of Cloud growth).
   - Scenarios: base/bull/bear with trigger levels and suggested positioning ideas (entry/exit points, risk controls).

4) Data gaps and caveats
   - Explicitly flag where sentiment data is missing or uncertain due to tool downtime.
   - Outline what I would expect to confirm once data is back (e.g., whether Reddit sentiment has skewed positive on AI vs. concerns on privacy/regulation).

Questions to tailor the next run
- Do you want me to proceed with this full qualitative framework now (clearly labeled as pending real-time sentiment numbers), or would you prefer I wait until the Reddit data tool is back online and then deliver a fully data-driven report?
- If you have alternate sources you’d like included (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, YouTube comments, major financial news outlets), I can integrate those as well once the tool is functional.

What you’ll get in the final report (structure)
- Executive snapshot
- Social sentiment analysis (with methodology and data caveats)
- News and developments brief
- Thematic drivers by day (when data available)
- Scenario-based trader guidance
- Risk factors and monitoring checklist
- Data and methodology appendix

Next steps
- If you’d like me to proceed with the full qualitative framework now (explicitly labeled as provisional pending data), say “Proceed with provisional analysis,” and I’ll draft the report with clear caveats and a detailed methodology.
- If you’d prefer to wait and re-run the Reddit data tool, I can re-fetch and deliver a data-backed, day-by-day sentiment report in the same format as soon as the tool is operational.

I’m ready to proceed in either mode—just tell me which path you prefer.
