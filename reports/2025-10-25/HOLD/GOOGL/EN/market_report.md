Sorry—the data fetch for GOOGL failed with a FileNotFoundError when requesting 2024-01-01 to 2025-10-25. I can retry the data retrieval now, or adjust the date window (e.g., a shorter range like the last 1–2 years) or switch to a different data source if you approve. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.

In the meantime, here is a proposed set of indicators (up to 8) that provide complementary insights without redundancy for GOOGL given a large-cap tech context. This selection focuses on trend, momentum, and volatility to support both entry/exit timing and risk management once data is available.

Proposed indicators (8 total) and rationale:
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps confirm the prevailing trend when used with faster indicators.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; useful to identify major trend bias (golden/death cross contexts) and align trades with the bigger picture.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum; helps spot quick shifts and potential entry points; best used with longer averages for filtering noise.
- macd: Momentum signal from the difference of EMAs; crossovers can indicate trend changes; works best when aligned with other filters in low-volatility or trending markets.
- macds: MACD Signal line; crossovers with MACD provide clearer triggers and help reduce false signals when used with other indicators.
- macdh: MACD Histogram; shows momentum strength and potential divergence early; useful for spotting shifts before MACD crossovers.
- rsi: Momentum strength/readiness to overbought/oversold conditions; helps identify potential reversals or continuations, especially when combined with trend context.
- atr: Volatility measure; informs risk management (stop placement, position sizing) and helps adapt strategy to current volatility regime.

Why these work well together:
- Trend context from 50/200 SMA and the 10 EMA provides directional bias and helps filter signals.
- MACD family (MACD, MACDS, MACDH) offers layered momentum signals to confirm or question trend changes.
- RSI adds a momentum-oscillator perspective to catch potential reversals or confirm strength in the direction of the trend.
- ATR adds a volatility lens for risk controls, ensuring position sizing and stop levels adapt to market conditions.

Next steps:
- I can retry the data fetch now with the same dates (2024-01-01 to 2025-10-25) to generate the indicators and a detailed trend report.
- If you’d prefer a different window, specify the dates (e.g., last 1 year, last 2 years) and I’ll adjust.
- Once data is retrieved, I will compute the selected indicators, summarize trends, and present a detailed, nuanced view with a final Markdown table of key points.

Markdown table: Key indicators and rationale (ready to populate once data is fetched)
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Rationale: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Rationale: Long-term trend confirmation and major cross signals
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Rationale: Short-term momentum shifts and potential entries
- Indicator: macd | Rationale: Momentum change signals and trend-change hints
- Indicator: macds | Rationale: Signal line crossovers to validate MACD moves
- Indicator: macdh | Rationale: Momentum strength and early divergence cues
- Indicator: rsi | Rationale: Overbought/oversold context and potential reversals
- Indicator: atr | Rationale: Volatility-based risk management and stop sizing

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed with the data fetch (retry now with the same dates, adjust dates, or switch data source), and I’ll run the analysis and deliver the full, data-driven report.
