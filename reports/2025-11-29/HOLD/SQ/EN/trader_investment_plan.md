I have carefully evaluated the proposed investment plan for Square Inc. (SQ) and considered the key points presented by both analysts. Based on my analysis, I concur with the Bull Analyst's assessment that SQ's growth potential, competitive advantages, and positive indicators outweigh the concerns raised by the Bear Analyst.

However, upon further review of SQ's financials and industry trends, I have identified some areas that warrant closer attention:

1. **Valuation:** While SQ's strong growth potential is impressive, its current valuation multiple may be higher than peers in the fintech industry. A more conservative approach would be to consider a Buy at a lower price point.
2. **Competition:** The fintech landscape has become increasingly competitive, with new entrants and established players vying for market share. SQ must continue to innovate and differentiate its services to maintain its competitive edge.

Considering these factors, I recommend a slightly adjusted Buy stance on Square Inc. (SQ), with the following conditions:

1. **Buy at $120 or lower:** If SQ's stock price falls below $120, I would consider increasing my position size as it may present an attractive buying opportunity.
2. **Monitor regulatory developments:** As mentioned earlier, regulatory risks associated with SQ's lending platform are a concern. I will continue to monitor these developments closely and adjust my position accordingly.

In conclusion, while SQ's growth potential and competitive advantages make it an attractive investment opportunity, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary to maximize returns.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
