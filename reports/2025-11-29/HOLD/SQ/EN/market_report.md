FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

I was unable to retrieve any historical price data for SQ from Yahoo Finance. This makes it challenging to analyze trends, momentum, or volatility using traditional technical analysis methods.

However, I can suggest that we consider the current market conditions and news related to Square Inc. (SQ). As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, SQ was a growing company with a strong presence in the fintech industry. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the company's financials, but it has since recovered.

Given the lack of historical data, I would recommend a wait-and-watch approach for SQ. If you're considering buying or holding SQ, I suggest keeping a close eye on news and events related to the company, such as new product launches, partnerships, or regulatory updates.

Here is a Markdown table summarizing key points from this analysis:

Please note that without historical data, traditional technical analysis methods are not applicable. A more nuanced approach would be required to make informed investment decisions.
