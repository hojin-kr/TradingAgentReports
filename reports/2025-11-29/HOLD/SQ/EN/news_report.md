**Macroeconomic Developments:**

According to Google News (2025-11-29), the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has led to a surge in energy prices, with Brent crude oil reaching its highest level since 2022. This has resulted in inflation concerns for many countries, particularly those heavily reliant on imported energy.

However, this sentiment is not uniform across all asset classes, with some traders expressing concerns about the potential impact of inflation on bond markets.

**Economic Indicators:**

The latest GDP data from Squawk (2025-11-29) indicates a slowdown in global economic growth, with many countries experiencing lower-than-expected expansions. This has led to a decrease in stock market indices, particularly those heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks.

However, some experts argue that this trend may be short-lived, citing strong fundamentals in certain sectors such as healthcare and consumer goods.
