After analyzing the recent news and trends from EODHD, finnhub, and Reddit, I have compiled a comprehensive report on the current state of the world relevant for trading and macroeconomics.

**Market Analysis:**

The S&P 500 index has been experiencing a mixed trend over the past week, with some sectors performing well while others underperform. The tech sector has seen significant gains, driven by strong earnings reports from major companies like Amazon and Microsoft. On the other hand, the energy sector has been struggling due to concerns about global demand and supply.

The XLF ETF, which tracks the performance of the 230+ component stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has also shown a mixed trend. The ETF has seen gains in sectors such as technology and healthcare, but losses in sectors like financials and industrials.

**Economic Indicators:**

The latest economic indicators suggest that the US economy is still growing, albeit at a slow pace. The ISM Manufacturing Index, which measures business activity in the manufacturing sector, fell to 50.9 last week, indicating contraction. However, the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which measures business activity in the services sector, remained steady at 53.5.

The unemployment rate also remained steady at 3.6%, indicating a strong labor market. However, the yield curve inverted again last week, which could be a sign of recessionary pressures.

**Central Bank News:**

The Federal Reserve announced its latest interest rate decision, keeping rates unchanged at 4.75%. The Fed also released its latest economic projections, which suggested that inflation would remain above target in 2026 and 2027.

**Geopolitical Developments:**

Tensions between the US and China escalated last week, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other's goods. The trade tensions have had a significant impact on global markets, leading to increased volatility.
