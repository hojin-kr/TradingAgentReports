A large dataset of daily stock prices!

This data appears to be a list of closing prices for various stocks over a period of time. The format is:

`YYYY-MM-DD    PRICE`

Where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date in the format of year-month-day and `PRICE` is the closing price for that day.

Here's a brief analysis of the dataset:

**Observations**

1. The data spans from October 2023 to November 2023, covering approximately 50 trading days.
2. The stock prices are generally increasing over time, with some fluctuations.
3. There are several stocks with similar closing price patterns, suggesting they may be in the same industry or sector.

**Insights**

1. **Stock Price Trends**: By analyzing the daily closing prices, we can identify trends and patterns in the market. For example, a stock that consistently shows an upward trend over time may indicate growth potential.
2. **Industry Clustering**: Stocks with similar price movements may belong to the same industry or sector. This could help investors make more informed decisions when allocating their investments across different sectors.
3. **Volatility**: The dataset shows periods of high volatility, where stock prices fluctuate rapidly. These periods can be an opportunity for traders and investors who are willing to take calculated risks.

**Analysis Questions**

1. Which stocks have the highest returns over the past 50 trading days?
2. How do the closing prices compare with the opening prices on each day?
3. Are there any stocks that consistently show a downward trend? What might be causing this?
