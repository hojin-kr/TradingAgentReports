After thoroughly analyzing the proposed investment plan and considering various factors, I have come to a conclusion that aligns with my risk management strategy and market expectations.

While QCOM's unique strengths and promising product pipelines are attractive features, I must also consider potential risks and challenges. The regulatory environment in the semiconductor industry is complex, and any changes could impact the company's operations and stock price. Additionally, intense competition from peers may limit QCOM's growth prospects.

However, after weighing these factors against the proposed investment plan, I believe that buying QCOM offers a favorable risk-reward ratio. The entry point of $252.40 seems to be a good value considering the company's unique strengths and the potential for growth in its product pipelines.

To mitigate potential risks, I would recommend adjusting the position size to 3% of your portfolio, given the moderate risk associated with investing in QCOM. This will allow you to take advantage of any potential upside while limiting potential losses if the stock price declines.

Finally, I agree that continuous monitoring and adjustments are crucial when investing in QCOM. It's essential to stay informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and company performance to make informed decisions.
