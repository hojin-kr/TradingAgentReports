Based on the output from the get_reddit_stock_info tool, I was able to gather some information about Pfizer's (PFE) current sentiment and recent news.

From Reddit, it appears that investors are cautiously optimistic about Pfizer's future prospects. The stock has been trending somewhat positively over the past week, with many users expressing confidence in the company's ability to navigate the ongoing pandemic and its impact on vaccine sales.

However, some users have also expressed concerns about the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny and competition from generic versions of Pfizer's vaccines. These concerns are largely centered around the recent approval of generic COVID-19 vaccines by the FDA.

In terms of recent news, Pfizer announced yesterday that it has begun shipping its new oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19, Paxlovid, to the US market. The company reported strong sales growth for the quarter, driven in large part by the continued demand for its COVID-19 vaccines.

Despite this positive news, some investors are still keeping a close eye on the company's guidance and outlook for future revenue growth. This is due in part to concerns about the potential impact of increased competition from generic versions of Pfizer's vaccines, as well as the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.

Overall, it seems that Pfizer's stock is currently trending upwards due to strong sales growth and confidence in the company's ability to navigate the ongoing pandemic. However, investors are still keeping a close eye on the company's guidance and outlook for future revenue growth.
