| **Close 200 SMA** | Confirms overall market trend and identifies golden/death cross setups. It reacts slowly, best used for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.   |
| **close\_10\_ema** | Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Prone to noise in choppy markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.    |
|  macd            | Computes momentum via differences of EMAs. Look for crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes. Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.   |
