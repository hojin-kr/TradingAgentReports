FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the current stock data for TSLA (Tesla Inc.), I propose the following indicators to analyze its trend and momentum:

### Moving Averages
- close_50_sma: 50 SMA (Medium-term trend indicator)
- close_200_sma: 200 SMA (Long-term trend benchmark)
- close_10_ema: 10 EMA (Responsive short-term average)

These moving averages provide a balanced view of Tesla's long-term and short-term trends. The 50-day SMA can help identify trend direction, while the 200-day SMA serves as a confirmation tool for overall market trend. The 10-day EMA is responsive to quick shifts in momentum, making it suitable for identifying potential entry points.

### MACD Related
- macd: MACD (Computes momentum via differences of EMAs)
- macds: MACD Signal (EMA smoothing of the MACD line)

The MACD provides insights into momentum changes by computing the difference between two EMAs. The MACD signal line helps filter false positives and confirm signals.

### Momentum Indicators
- rsi: RSI (Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions)

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures momentum and identifies potential reversals based on 70/30 thresholds.

### Volatility Indicators
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands)
- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band (Typically 2 standard deviations above the middle line)
- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band (Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle line)

Bollinger Bands provide a dynamic benchmark for price movement, and their upper and lower bands serve as signals for potential overbought/oversold conditions.

### Volume-Based Indicators
- vwma: VWMA (A moving average weighted by volume)

The VWMA confirms trends by integrating price action with volume data, providing insights into the stock's strength and momentum.
