Based on the comprehensive analysis provided, I have carefully evaluated the arguments presented by both analysts and considered various factors that may impact the investment decision. After weighing the pros and cons, I agree with the recommendation to sell the stock.

However, upon further review of the technical market trends, macroeconomic indicators, and social media sentiment, I would like to modify the action plan to better align with my analysis.

**Revised Action Plan**

1. **Downgrade**: Downgrade the stock from Buy to Sell due to increased risk associated with market fluctuations, interest rate hikes, and economic downturns.
2. **Reduce Position Size**: Reduce the position size of the trade by 50% to minimize potential losses in case the stock price declines further.
3. **Set Stop-Loss Order**: Set a stop-loss order at 10% below the current price to automatically sell the stock if it falls below this level, but with an additional consideration: if the stock price reaches the stop-loss threshold, I would reassess the situation and consider buying back into the stock if the company's fundamentals have improved significantly and market conditions have become more favorable.
4. **Monitor News and Trends**: Continuously monitor news and trends related to the company, interest rates, and economic indicators to reassess the investment thesis as needed.

Given my analysis, I believe that the revised action plan provides a more balanced approach to managing risk while allowing for potential opportunities in the future.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
