## Final Transaction Proposal:

Given the technical analysis of AFRM's historical data from 2025-11-14 to 2025-11-29, we observe the following trends and insights:

1.  The closing price SMA (close_50_sma) indicates a medium-term trend direction. It was lagging price but served as dynamic support/resistance. Combining it with faster indicators can provide timely signals.
2.  MACD values show that there were crossovers, divergence, and changes in momentum over the given period. However, they lagged due to their slow nature. Confirming them with other indicators can help identify trend changes more effectively.
3.  RSI values revealed potential overbought/oversold conditions at various points. Applying 70/30 thresholds and watching for divergence with trend analysis can signal reversals. However, RSI remained extreme in strong trends and should be cross-checked with trend analysis.
4.  Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) served as a dynamic benchmark for price movement. Combining it with the upper and lower bands effectively spots breakouts or reversals.
5.  ATR values showed variability in market volatility over time. Setting stop-loss levels and adjusting position sizes based on current market volatility can aid risk management.

## Recommendation:
Based on these insights, we propose holding AFRM stock due to its recent strong performance and potential for continued growth. However, it's essential to maintain a watchful eye on the MACD line crossovers, RSI values, Bollinger Bands, and ATR measures to adjust the trading strategy as needed.
