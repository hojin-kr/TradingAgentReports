# Investment Report: NFLX
## Executive Summary
Netflix (NFLX) growth potential may be overstated due to increased competition in the streaming market, making it a less attractive investment opportunity.

## Investment Decision
SELL

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
The streaming market has become increasingly crowded with new entrants, potentially eroding Netflix's market share and leading to a decline in its stock price. Competition from Disney+, HBO Max, and other services may reduce Netflix's ability to innovate and adapt to changing market trends.

## Risks To Watch
Netflix's struggle to maintain subscription numbers in the face of growing competition could lead to a decline in its stock price. The company's reliance on a single revenue stream also increases its vulnerability to changes in consumer behavior or market conditions.
