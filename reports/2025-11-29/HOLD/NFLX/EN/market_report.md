## FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY/HOLD/SELL

Based on the historical data provided, here is a summary of the key observations:

*   The closing price of NFLX has been consistently increasing over the past few months, indicating a strong uptrend.
*   The 50-day SMA (close\_50\_sma) value has been rising steadily, confirming the trend and serving as dynamic support/resistance levels. When close\_50\_sma dips below its moving average line, it indicates that the price may be due for a bounce back up to or above the moving average.
*   The MACD (macd) line has crossed above the signal line (macds), indicating a buy signal. This is a bullish indication, suggesting that the stock may be poised for further growth.
*   The RSI (rsi) value has been in the oversold territory (below 30) for several consecutive days, which could be a buy opportunity.

Based on these observations, here's a proposal:

**Buy Recommendation:** NFLX at current market price

**Reasoning:**

1.  The closing price of NFLX has been increasing steadily over the past few months, indicating a strong uptrend.
2.  The MACD line crossing above the signal line suggests a buy signal, indicating that the stock may be poised for further growth.
3.  The RSI value is in the oversold territory, suggesting potential buying opportunities.

**Risk Management:** Set a stop-loss at 5% below the current market price to limit potential losses in case the trend reverses.

By following this proposal, traders can potentially capitalize on the uptrend of NFLX and ride the momentum while managing risk effectively.
