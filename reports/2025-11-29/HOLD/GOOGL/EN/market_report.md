FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the provided indicators, we will analyze the current market situation of GOOGL.

The 50 SMA has been in a slightly downtrend since November 15th, but it recently crossed above the 200 SMA on November 17th. This could be considered a buy signal for long-term investors.

For the short-term, RSI values are around 70-80, which may indicate an overbought condition. However, we should wait for a possible pullback to re-enter the market.

Considering the overall trend, volatility, and momentum, our current proposal is to hold GOOGL stocks with a long-term perspective.

**Key Points:**

*   Hold with a long-term perspective.
*   Look for potential buy signals from the 50 SMA crossover with the 200 SMA.
*   Monitor RSI values for overbought/oversold conditions and possible reversals.

Please note that this is just an analysis based on available data, and actual market behavior may vary.
