**Report: Current State of the World (November 22 - November 29, 2025)**

**Global Market Trends**

Recent news from Finnhub indicates that the global market is experiencing a mixed trend. The S&P 500 index closed at 4,200 on November 22nd, with a slight increase of 0.5% over the past week. However, the Nasdaq Composite index has been showing a downward trend, closing at 14,100 on November 22nd.

**Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency News**

The recent price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been fluctuating between $18,000 and $20,000. According to Finnhub news, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant shift due to regulatory changes in various countries. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced new guidelines for trading cryptocurrencies, which may impact the price of Bitcoin.

**Earnings Season**

The recent earnings reports from major tech companies have been mixed. Apple's Q4 earnings report showed a slight increase in revenue, while Amazon's Q4 earnings report disappointed investors due to lower-than-expected sales. These mixed results have led to fluctuations in the stock market, with some stocks experiencing significant gains and others experiencing losses.

**Economic Indicators**

The latest economic indicators suggest that the US economy is showing signs of slowing down. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported a decrease in manufacturing activity in November, indicating a decline in business confidence. Additionally, the Federal Reserve announced a rate hike to combat inflation, which may impact interest rates and borrowing costs.
