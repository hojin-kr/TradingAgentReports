Based on the recent news and trends, here is a comprehensive report of the current state of the world that is relevant for trading and macroeconomics:

**Global Markets:**

The S&P 500 index has been experiencing volatility in the past week, with a significant decline on Tuesday (Nov 22) followed by a rebound on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also saw a similar trend, with a decline on Monday (Nov 21) but recovering on Tuesday.

In contrast, the Euro Stoxx 50 index has been relatively stable, with a slight increase over the past week. This could be attributed to the European Central Bank's recent interest rate hike, which may have boosted investor confidence in the region.

**Economic Data:**

The latest GDP data from the US showed a slower-than-expected growth rate of 2.1% in Q3 2025, down from 2.5% in Q2 2025. This could be seen as a negative sign for the market, but it's also worth noting that the economy has been experiencing a slowdown due to various factors such as global trade tensions and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

**Central Bank News:**

The Federal Reserve announced a 25-basis-point interest rate hike at its latest meeting, bringing the benchmark rate to 4.75%. This move is aimed at curbing inflation, which has been rising steadily over the past few months.

**Industry Trends:**

The technology sector has been experiencing significant volatility in recent days, with some major players like Apple and Amazon seeing their stock prices decline due to concerns over slowing growth and increased competition.

On the other hand, the healthcare sector has been performing well, driven by strong earnings reports from pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.
