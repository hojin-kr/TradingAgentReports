FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**

The current trend analysis of COST suggests that the stock is in an upward direction, driven by positive momentum indicators such as the closing 50 SMA (933.8922570800781) and Bollinger Middle (926.0156158447265). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) values have been oscillating between 30-50, indicating a moderate level of momentum, while the MACD Histogram has been trending upwards, confirming the bullish trend.

The closing price on November 28th ($922.6511499023437) was below the Bollinger Middle line, indicating that it was trading near its lower band, but this is not an unusual behavior for COST, given the overall upward trend of the stock.

Given these observations, a buy recommendation is made for COST, with a target price around $950 and a stop-loss order set at $920. This proposal suggests that the investor should buy COST when it hits the current support level ($920), expecting the stock to continue its upward momentum and potentially reach the target price of $950.
