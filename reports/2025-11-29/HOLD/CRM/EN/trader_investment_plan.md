Based on the proposed investment plan and the analysis provided, I agree with your recommendation to sell CRM stock due to the potential risks and challenges outweighing its long-term growth potential. The concerns about CRM's reliance on international sales and the potential risks associated with trade tensions are well-founded and warrant caution.

However, before making a final decision, I would like to consider an additional factor that could impact the market sentiment: recent news about CRM's plans to expand its offerings into new markets, such as cloud-based customer relationship management solutions. While this move may be seen as a positive step by some investors, it also introduces new risks and uncertainties.

Taking these factors into account, I would like to refine my recommendation slightly. Instead of selling the stock outright, I propose holding onto CRM stock for now, but with a more cautious approach. This means:

1. Scaling back position size: Reduce the investment amount in CRM stock to minimize potential losses.
2. Implementing a stop-loss order: Set a price level at which to automatically sell the stock if it falls below a certain threshold.
3. Monitoring CRM's performance closely: Keep a close eye on CRM's financials, product developments, and market trends to adjust the investment strategy as needed.

By taking this more cautious approach, I believe we can mitigate some of the risks associated with CRM's diversified revenue streams and global trade tensions, while still benefiting from its competitive advantages and strategic expansion plans.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
