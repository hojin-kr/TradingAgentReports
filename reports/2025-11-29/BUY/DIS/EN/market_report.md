The closing price of DIS on November 14, 2025, was $107.15406197768601. The stock has been showing an uptrend since then. However, the current prices are relatively stable with no significant breaks above or below the 20-day moving average. 

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) values range from 40 to 74 over the given period. RSI is used for identifying overbought and oversold conditions. Since RSI values on November 26 were at 37, it's considered oversold but not in a strong downtrend phase yet.
