Based on the comprehensive analysis provided by your team of analysts, I agree that selling is the most prudent course of action for PLTR at this time. The bearish arguments presented during the debate highlight several key concerns about the company's financial health and prospects, which outweigh the growth potential and competitive advantages presented by the bull analyst.

The market saturation issue, competitive weaknesses, and negative indicators all raise significant concerns about PLTR's ability to succeed in a crowded and rapidly changing EV market. The cryptocurrency market decline and EV stock price drop also suggest that investor sentiment is shifting away from PLTR, which could further exacerbate any potential losses.

In light of this analysis, I recommend selling 50% of PLTR shares immediately to limit potential losses. The stop-loss order at 20% below the current price will provide additional protection against potential losses and allow us to adjust the investment plan as necessary based on new market data and developments.

To further mitigate potential risks, we should also consider diversifying our portfolio by investing in other stocks or asset classes that may be less affected by the risks associated with PLTR. This could include companies in the renewable energy sector, electric vehicle component suppliers, or other industries that are not directly impacted by the EV market trends.

By selling and diversifying our portfolio, we can minimize potential losses and avoid further investing in a stock that may be subject to significant declines.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
