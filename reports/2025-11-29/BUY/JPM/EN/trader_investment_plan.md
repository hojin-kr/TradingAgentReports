I have carefully analyzed the proposed investment plan and considered the key points from both sides of the debate. Based on my analysis, I would recommend a **BUY** stance for JPMorgan Chase.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The bank's strategic partnerships and acquisitions are a significant driver of growth and revenue expansion. The recent announcement of a new credit card partnership demonstrates the bank's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.
2. Positive sentiment analysis from social media platforms, such as Reddit, suggests that JPMorgan Chase has a resilient and adaptable brand.
3. While stagnant revenue growth is a concern, I believe that the bank's strong business model and market positioning will give it an edge over its competitors.

To implement this recommendation, I would suggest the following strategic actions:

1. **Increase exposure to JPM's dividend-paying stocks**: Given the bank's consistent dividend payouts, consider increasing your exposure to its dividend-paying stocks.
2. **Monitor JPM's partnerships and acquisitions**: Keep a close eye on any new partnerships or acquisitions that JPMorgan Chase announces, as these can be key drivers of growth and revenue expansion.

By taking a long-term view and focusing on the bank's strategic partnerships and positive sentiment analysis, I believe that we can make an informed decision about investing in JPMorgan Chase.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
