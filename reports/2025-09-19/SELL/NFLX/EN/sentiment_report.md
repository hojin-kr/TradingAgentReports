Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch NFLX Reddit sentiment data for 2025-09-19, but the tool returned a backend error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

In short, I can’t access the latest Reddit data right now due to a filesystem/backend issue on the data source. This blocks me from delivering the detailed, day-by-day sentiment analysis and the Reddit-driven insights you asked for.

Here are the options I can pursue next, depending on what you’d prefer:

- Option A — Retry now: I can immediately retry the Reddit data pull and proceed with the full long-report once the tool returns results. If the backend issue is transient, this should resolve quickly.

- Option B — Switch to alternatives: I can compile a comprehensive analysis using other publicly available signals (e.g., public news headlines, company announcements, earnings commentary, social chatter on other platforms) and clearly label any sentiment gaps due to the missing Reddit feed. I can still deliver a robust traders’ brief with:
  - sentiment themes (positive/negative/neutral)
  - notable Reddit-style themes if/when data becomes available
  - recent company news and their potential impact
  - implications and trade considerations (short-term catalysts, risk factors)
  - a structured markdown table at the end summarizing key points

- Option C — Interim framework: If you’d like, I can deliver the full long-form NFLX report framework now (structure, methodology, what I will look for, how I’ll quantify sentiment, etc.) and a placeholder Markdown table. Then I’ll drop in the actual sentiment figures and quotes as soon as the Reddit data source comes back online.

What would you like to do? 
- If you want me to retry, I’ll initiate another data pull for NFLX on 2025-09-19 immediately.
- If you’d prefer alternatives, I can start assembling a full reporter-style analysis using other signals and clearly note the data gaps.
- If you want a skeleton framework now, I can provide that plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table.
