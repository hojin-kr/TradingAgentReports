I attempted to fetch NFLX fundamental data for 2025-09-19 using the provided data tools, but the tool layer returned a FileNotFoundError for all requests. That indicates the data backend is currently unavailable or misconfigured. I can’t pull the latest insider sentiment/transactions or the SimFin data at the moment. 

Options to proceed
- Retry now: I can attempt the tool calls again in a moment if you’d like.
- Do a best-effort outline: I can provide a comprehensive, trader-focused report structure with placeholders for the data, so you (or another assistant) can drop in the actual figures as soon as the tools are working.
- Use public context up to my knowledge cutoff: I can deliver a detailed qualitative assessment of Netflix fundamentals based on publicly known information up to 2024, with clear caveats about data being out-of-date for 2025.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with a structured framework (and placeholders) while we retry the tools, here’s a comprehensive report outline you can fill in once data becomes available.

Next steps
- If you want me to continue now, I can reattempt the data fetch as soon as the tool environment is available. Please let me know if I should retry immediately or in a specific timeframe.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative assessment using Netflix’s publicly known context up to 2024, clearly labeled as historical context and not 2025-09-19 data.
- Once the tools are accessible, I will populate the table and report with exact figures from:
  - Insider sentiment: get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment
  - Insider transactions: get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions
  - Balance sheet: get_simfin_balance_sheet (quarterly)
  - Income statement: get_simfin_income_stmt (quarterly)
  - Cash flow: get_simfin_cashflow (quarterly)

Would you like me to retry the tool calls now, or would you prefer I proceed with the qualitative 2024-era analysis and the skeleton report above in the meantime?
