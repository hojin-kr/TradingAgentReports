I tried to fetch NFLX data for 2024-09-19 to 2025-09-19, but the data retrieval step returned a FileNotFoundError (backend file issue). I can retry with another window or switch to an alternative data source if you’d like, but I don’t have fresh price data right now to compute and verify the indicators. In the meantime, here’s a careful plan for NFLX analysis and the specific indicators I’d use once data is available, along with how I’d interpret them in current market context.

Proposed 8 indicators for NFLX (complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm sustained trend instead of counter-trend noise.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark; useful to confirm whether we’re in a broader uptrend or downtrend and to validate trend strength against intermediate signals.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  Why: More responsive short-term momentum; can highlight quick shifts in direction to catch early entries or exits.
- macd (MACD line)
  Why: Momentum and trend-change signal via crossovers; helpful to confirm potential trend reversals or accelerations when aligned with price action.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: Smoother signal line; crossovers with MACD provide more robust entry/exit cues when combined with price and other indicators.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  Why: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential; can give early warning of fading momentum before MACD line/crossover occurs.
- rsi (RSI)
  Why: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and divergences; good supplement to trend indicators, especially in range-bound conditions.
- atr (Average True Range)
  Why: Measures volatility; informs position sizing, stop placement, and risk management; helps tailor expectations in earnings-driven moves or macro-driven volatility bursts.

Rationale for this set in NFLX context
- NFLX often experiences episodes of high volatility around earnings, subscriber guidance, or streaming landscape shifts. The ATR helps manage risk during such events.
- A combination of 50/200 SMAs and 10-EMA gives a layered view of trend: long-term direction (200 SMA), intermediate trend (50 SMA), and near-term momentum (10 EMA). This helps distinguish genuine trend changes from short-lived pullbacks.
- The MACD family (macd, macds, macdh) plus RSI provides a robust mix of momentum signals and divergence checks to confirm or question potential trend changes.
- The set avoids overlapping or redundant signals (e.g., avoids including stochastic indicators or multiple RSI-like measures). It emphasizes trend, momentum, and volatility in a balanced manner.

What I’d look for and how I’d interpret signals (when data is available)
- Trend confirmation
  - Price above 200 SMA and 50 SMA: suggests a longer-term uptrend; look for pullbacks toward the 50 SMA or 10 EMA as potential entries if momentum remains positive.
  - Price crossing below these moving averages or moving averages turning down: could indicate trend weakening; require confluence from MACD and RSI for stronger signals.
- Momentum cues
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD Signal in positive territory (MACD > 0): bullish momentum signal with trend support; consider pullback entries near support levels (e.g., 50 SMA or prior swing lows).
  - MACD histogram expanding positive values: increasing bullish momentum; watch for price confirmation.
  - RSI rising from oversold toward neutral/overbought (e.g., 40–70 range) in the context of uptrends: confirm momentum but be wary of overbought extremes in strong uptrends (divergence checks using price highs can help).
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising: higher volatility; adjust stop losses and position sizes accordingly; consider wider stops around earnings or guidance events.
  - ATR declining during a rally: lower volatility may indicate consolidation; be patient for clear breakout signals.
- Entry/exit framework (example)
  - Long setup: price above 50 and 200 SMAs, MACD line above MACD Signal, MACD in positive territory, RSI not in extreme overbought territory, ATR rising moderately.
  - Short setup: price below 50 and 200 SMAs, MACD line below MACD Signal, RSI trending downward but not necessarily oversold, ATR increasing on downside moves for risk control.

Notes, caveats, and Netflix-specific considerations
- Earnings cadence: NFLX earnings surprises can drive abrupt moves; rely on ATR for risk sizing, and prefer signals that confirm beyond a single earnings spike.
- Subscriber trends and content strategy: Positive or negative guidance can shift momentum; MACD and RSI should be interpreted in the context of price action around support/resistance levels and moving averages.
- Market regime: In high-volatility regimes, rely more on volatility-aware signals (ATR) and ensure your entries have price confirmation from at least two indicators (e.g., MACD momentum + price above a moving average).

What I need from you to proceed
- Confirm whether you’d like me to retry data retrieval now (potentially with a different date window, e.g., a shorter recent window like last 6–12 months) or proceed with the indicator plan and wait for data to be fetched.
- If you have a preferred date range or data source, share it and I’ll adapt the fetch accordingly.

Proposed Markdown table: key indicators, category, and what they help you assess for NFLX
- Note: This table summarizes the plan and intended interpretation once data is available.

| Indicator | Category | What it helps assess in NFLX context |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Helps identify intermediate trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; filters noise from near-term moves. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Confirms long-term trend direction; gauges overall market regime and trend strength. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Captures quick momentum shifts; signals potential entry points when aligned with longer-term trends. |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum trend change signals; look for crossovers with MACD Signal and alignment with price action. |
| macds | MACD Related | Smoother momentum signal; crossovers provide corroboration for trades and reduce false signals. |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergence indicator; can flag weakening or accelerating momentum ahead of crossovers. |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold context and divergence; complements trend signals, especially in range or pullback scenarios. |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Risk management and position sizing; signals expected volatility, guiding stop placement and exit strategy. |

Next step
- Tell me how you’d like to proceed: retry data fetch now (specify a window) or proceed with the indicator framework and I’ll fetch data as soon as the backend is available. I’ll then deliver a detailed, data-driven trend report with the 8 indicators, including cross-checks, signal interpretations, and actionable ideas for NFLX.
