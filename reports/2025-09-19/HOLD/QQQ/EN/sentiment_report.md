Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch the latest Reddit data for QQQ (as requested) but hit a tool error: FileNotFoundError. That appears to be a runtime issue with the data fetch tool, not something you did. I can’t cure the tool on my end, but I can still move the analysis forward in a couple of ways and prepare you a thorough report you can use as soon as the data fetch is working again.

What I can do right now
- Provide a comprehensive structure and initial qualitative analysis for QQQ based on typical drivers for an NASDAQ-100 ETF and the general social media sentiment narrative around tech-focused indices.
- Outline exactly what we will extract and how we’ll interpret it once the Reddit data feed is available again (daily sentiment, post volumes, top themes, key creators, notable shifts day-to-day).
- Prepare a detailed report with sections you can fill in as soon as the tool returns data, plus a finalized Markdown table at the end.

Proposed plan (short-term)
1) Retry Reddit data fetch:
   - I can attempt again to pull the latest Reddit stock info for QQQ. If you’re able to try again in a few minutes, we may get a successful response once the tool issue is resolved.
2) If the tool remains unavailable, I will:
   - Proceed with a best-effort qualitative interpretation framework using public news flow and typical sentiment drivers for tech-heavy indices.
   - Clearly label data-driven insights as “to be confirmed” once Reddit data becomes available again.
3) Deliverable:
   - A long-form report detailing sentiment, news, and implications for traders.
   - A final Markdown table summarizing key points and actionable insights.

Draft report outline (with placeholders where Reddit data will go)
- Executive snapshot
  - What you’re looking for: whether Reddit sentiment around QQQ has turned more bullish, bearish, or stayed mixed over the past week, and how that aligns with overall market price action.
  - Current status: Reddit data fetch failed; proceeding with plan to fill in once data returns.

- Data and methodology (what we will extract)
  - Daily sentiment score and volume (positive, negative, neutral)
  - Top themes/divisors in posts (e.g., AI hype, rate expectations, tech earnings, macro risk)
  - Key influencers (accounts that drive sentiment)
  - News alignment check (how Reddit sentiment correlates with latest headlines and company news in the NASDAQ-100 tech space)
  - Time window: past 7 days (as requested)

- News landscape (past week)
  - Summary of notable tech sector headlines affecting QQQ: AI developments, cloud/computing demand signals, semiconductor trends, regulatory/policy chatter, earnings timing impacts (if any from large holdings), and macro backdrop (rates, inflation, macro risk appetite).
  - How these headlines typically influence sentiment on a tech-heavy ETF like QQQ.

- Sentiment analysis and interpretation
  - Overall sentiment trend: bullish/bearish/mixed (to be filled)
  - Day-by-day flavor: a granular read of sentiment dynamics (e.g., Intermittent spikes around specific headlines)
  - Thematic drivers: which themes are correlating with sentiment shifts (AI, cloud, chips, valuation concerns, risk-on risk-off)

- Price action and flows (contextual)
  - How QQQ has traded over the past week in terms of price, volume, intraday volatility
  - Typical relationship between Reddit sentiment and QQQ moves (short-term vs. longer-term signals)
  - Potential liquidity and flow considerations

- Implications for traders
  - Short-term trading cues (when sentiment shifts precede or lag price moves)
  - Risk management (headline risk, regime shifts in tech leadership)
  - Positioning ideas (e.g., hedges, diversification within NASDAQ-100 exposure)

- Limitations and caveats
  - Reddit is just one data source; synthesize with other sentiment and fundamental inputs
  - ETF-specific considerations (composition concentration in big tech names, sector concentration risk)

- Conclusion and takeaways
  - Practical guidance for traders on how to interpret sentiment around QQQ in the context of the week’s news and macro backdrop

Proposed Markdown table (to append at the end)
- This table will summarize key findings once data is available. Right now it’s a placeholder you can rely on after Reddit data returns.

- Key Point | Data Source | Current Read (TBD) | Implications
- Sentiment Tilt | Reddit (pending) | TBD | Would guide near-term risk tone
- Top Themes | Reddit (pending) | TBD | Indicates what drivers traders care about
- Volume/Engagement | Reddit (pending) | TBD | Signals intensity of interest
- News Alignment | News feeds + Reddit (pending) | TBD | Correlation between headlines and sentiment
- Price Action Context | Price data (past 7 days) | TBD | Helps gauge sentiment-to-move relationship
- Risk Factors | Macro/tech headlines | TBD | Potential catalysts for volatility

What I need from you
- If you’d like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, I can kick off another attempt immediately.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with the qualitative framework right away and deliver a full, well-structured report with placeholders that you can fill as soon as the Reddit data comes back.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit fetch now, or proceed with the qualitative, data-agnostic report and fill in the Reddit-driven sections later?
