I attempted to fetch Reddit data for SPY on 2025-09-19, but the tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). This looks like a temporary backend issue with the data source.

I can proceed in a couple of ways—please tell me which you prefer:
- Retry now: I’ll try querying the Reddit data again immediately.
- Backup plan: I’ll proceed with a comprehensive analysis using available alternative signals (e.g., general market sentiment, macro-news affecting SPY, and typical ETF/GSP flows) and prepare the long-form report with a Markdown table at the end. This won’t rely on the Reddit feed for SPY specifically, but will still aim to deliver actionable insights for traders.

If you want the backup plan, I’ll cover:
- Daily sentiment overview for the past week (via social media and public chatter) focused on SPY and the broad market themes driving it.
- Key news and macro events (Fed commentary, inflation data, geopolitical headlines, major earnings/macroeconomic datapoints) and their potential impact on SPY.
- Thematic risk/tilt analysis (equity breadth, sector rotation signals, volatility regime, flow indicators) relevant to SPY.
- Trade implications for traders (short-term tactical ideas, risk controls, potential catalysts).
- A concise, easy-to-scan Markdown table summarizing key points, actionable takeaways, and risk factors.

Tell me which path you’d like (retry now or proceed with the backup plan), and I’ll move forward accordingly.
