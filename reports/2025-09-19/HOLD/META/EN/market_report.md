I attempted to fetch META data but I’m seeing a backend file-not-found error from the data retrieval tool. This appears to be an environment issue with the Yahoo Finance data file, not a user error. I can retry in a moment, or switch to a qualitative plan now and prepare the full indicator analysis once the data fetch succeeds.

Proposed path forward (if you’d like me to proceed now)
- I’ll retry retrieving META data for 2023-09-19 to 2025-09-19 as soon as the data tool is available again.
- Once data is retrieved, I’ll compute up to 8 complementary indicators (from the allowed list) and deliver a detailed, nuanced trend report with actionable insights, including a final Markdown table summarizing the indicators and their roles.

Recommended indicator suite for META (8 indicators, non-redundant, complementary)
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages (short-term)
  - Why: Captures quick momentum shifts and potential entry points; useful for META’s often volatile price moves.
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (mid-term)
  - Why: Provides a clearer trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps filter noise from the short-term EMA.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (long-term)
  - Why: Global trend benchmark; useful for confirming major trend direction and evaluating potential long-term bias for META.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: Momentum and trend change signals via MACD line crossovers; complements trend indicators with momentum confirmation.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD line help refine entries/exits and reduce false signals.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Why: MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences; adds depth to momentum analysis.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Why: Overbought/oversold context and momentum strength; useful for spotting reversals or narrowing in strong trends.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Why: Measures volatility for risk management; informs stop placement and position sizing in dynamic META markets.

Rationale for this set in META’s context (2023-2025)
- META has experienced sizable volatility driven by ad-market dynamics, product launches, regulatory developments, and big-tech cycles. A mix of trend (10/50/200 SMAs), robust momentum (MACD trio and RSI), and volatility ( ATR ) provides a balanced, non-redundant view:
  - Trend confirmation: 10/50/200 SMAs help differentiate short-term shifts from structural changes, which is critical in an environment where META can swing on quarterly results and regulatory headlines.
  - Momentum clarity: MACD components plus RSI help confirm potential breakouts or pullbacks and reduce false signals in choppy periods.
  - Risk management: ATR adds a practical sense of current price dispersion, aiding in dynamic position sizing and stop placement aligned with META’s volatility regime.

Next steps
- I’ll reattempt the data retrieval for META as soon as the data service is available. If you’d prefer, I can proceed with the methodology and indicator framework now and simply fill in the data and produce the full report once the fetch succeeds.
- Alternatively, I can switch to a qualitative, assumption-based analysis using typical META patterns from this period, but that would be less precise without the raw data.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with the outlined indicator plan and deliver once the data is retrieved? 

Final note: If you want, I can also run a parallel check on alternative data sources (if available to the system) to avoid downtime, then proceed with the full report as soon as any data becomes accessible.
