I attempted to fetch META-related Reddit stock posts for the requested dates, but I'm hitting a tool error:

- Parallel fetch across 2025-09-13 to 2025-09-19 returned FileNotFoundError: "No such file or directory."
- A direct call for 2025-09-19 also returned the same error.

Because I can’t pull the Reddit data right now, I can either (a) retry the tool, (b) proceed with a high-level META analysis using other publicly available signals, or (c) wait for the Reddit tool to come back online. Let me know which you prefer. In the meantime, here’s a structured plan and a CONTINUATION draft you can use once the data is available, plus a ready-to-fill Markdown table at the end.

What I’ll deliver once we have the Reddit data
- A day-by-day sentiment analysis for META from Reddit posts over the past week, with:
  - Net sentiment score per day
  - Leading themes (e.g., ads demand, AI monetization, Threads, metaverse progress, safety/regulatory concerns)
  - Notable post-level takeaways (summaries of high-engagement posts, influencer signals, or meme-driven sentiment)
  - Implied near-term price action cues (based on sentiment momentum and key posts)
- A synthesis of recent META company news (earnings posture, product updates, regulatory/regulatory-compliance signals, executive commentary) and how they align with Reddit sentiment.
- A trader-focused interpretation:
  - What the sentiment momentum suggests for near-term volatility vs. drift
  - Potential catalysts to watch in the next 1–2 weeks (earnings windows, product launches, regulatory updates)
  - Risk/return scenarios (bull case, bear case, base case) with quantified-style implications where possible
- A concise, actionable takeaway for positioning (if and when you want a final trade signal: BUY/HOLD/SELL, plus rationale)

Provisional META context you can use right away (no data pull required)
- Business backdrop:
  - META’s core revenue is driven by advertising; ad demand is sensitive to macro cycles, brand budgets, and platform engagement metrics across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.
  - AI integration and creator economy features are ongoing monetization levers (ads in Reels, commerce features, creator tools). Expect investor focus on how AI accelerates ad efficiency and monetization rather than just user growth.
  - Messaging and short-form video remain central to user engagement; Threads’ role in overall user activity and monetization has evolved but remains a topic of investor interest.
- Key risks:
  - Ad-market softness or cyclicality could weigh on revenue in the near term.
  - Regulatory scrutiny around data privacy, antitrust, and app store practices remains a lingering overhang, especially in the EU and US.
  - Competitive dynamics with TikTok and other social platforms pressuring META to innovate rapidly.
- Key opportunities:
  - AI-enabled ad targeting and optimization could lift yield per impression if ads scale efficiently.
  - Commerce features and shopping integrations across apps could unlock additional monetization beyond ads.
  - Continued diversification into virtual/augmented experiences may create optionality, though this is more long-horizon.

What I can do next (one of these, just say the word)
- Retry the Reddit data pull now for META (all dates) and then produce the full day-by-day sentiment report with the Markdown table at the end.
- Do a thorough analysis using non-Reddit sources (press releases, earnings calls, regulatory filings, mainstream finance news) to deliver a robust, trader-focused META snapshot for the past week, with a synthetic sentiment overlay and cautious speculation on daily moves.
- Wait for the Reddit tool to come back and then proceed with the original plan, delivering the complete long-form report plus the table.

Proposed Markdown table skeleton (to fill once data is in)
- This is a ready-to-fill structure you can paste into the final report. Replace [score], [themes], [notes] with actual data.

Markdown table (ready to populate)
- Date | Net Reddit Sentiment | Daily Themes (Top 3) | Notable Posts/Events | News Tie-ins | Implied Short-Term Signal
- 2025-09-13 | [score] | [theme1; theme2; theme3] | [post1 gist; post2 gist] | [PR/news item] | [bullish/bearish signal]
- 2025-09-14 | [score] | [theme1; theme2; theme3] | [post1 gist; post2 gist] | [PR/news item] | [bullish/bearish signal]
- 2025-09-15 | [score] | [theme1; theme2; theme3] | [post1 gist; post2 gist] | [PR/news item] | [bullish/bearish signal]
- 2025-09-16 | [score] | [theme1; theme2; theme3] | [post1 gist; post2 gist] | [PR/news item] | [bullish/bearish signal]
- 2025-09-17 | [score] | [theme1; theme2; theme3] | [post1 gist; post2 gist] | [PR/news item] | [bullish/bearish signal]
- 2025-09-18 | [score] | [theme1; theme2; theme3] | [post1 gist; post2 gist] | [PR/news item] | [bullish/bearish signal]
- 2025-09-19 | [score] | [theme1; theme2; theme3] | [post1 gist; post2 gist] | [PR/news item] | [bullish/bearish signal]

If you’d like me to proceed right now, tell me which path to take:
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch for META now, and then deliver the full long-form report with the day-by-day sentiment and the Markdown table.
- Option B: Proceed with a comprehensive META analysis using non-Reddit sources only, delivering a concise but trader-focused weekly snapshot (plus a synthesized sentiment overlay).
- Option C: Wait and retry the Reddit tool, then deliver the complete analysis once it’s back.

I’m ready to proceed as soon as you pick an option.
