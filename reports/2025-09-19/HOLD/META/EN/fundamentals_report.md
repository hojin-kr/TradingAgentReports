Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch META’s fundamentals for the past week, but all data retrieval attempts hit a FileNotFoundError in the tooling environment. Here’s what happened and how we can move forward.

What happened
- Attempts to pull data in parallel (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly SimFin statements) failed with FileNotFoundError.
- Individual tool calls to get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment, get_simfin_balance_sheet, get_simfin_income_stmt, and get_simfin_cashflow also returned the same error.
- I do not have any valid numeric data to compile a full fundamentals report right now due to the environment error.

What I can do next (options)
1) Retry immediately
   - If you’d like, I can re-run the data fetch in a moment. Sometimes these environments recover quickly, and parallel calls can succeed on a second attempt.
2) Switch data sources or scope
   - If you’re open to it, I can:
     - Use alternative endpoints or data sources (if available in this workspace) to obtain insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow for META.
     - Or focus on a qualitative, narrative fundamentals review based on public disclosures (annual/quarterly reports, press releases) and document the key risk/driver themes without exact figures.
3) Proceed with a structured placeholder report
   - I can generate a comprehensive report skeleton with the exact sections and placeholders for where the data will go. This would include:
     - Company profile and business model
     - Summary of recent quarterly/annual results (high-level, no numbers)
     - Balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow sections (descriptive, no figures)
     - Insider sentiment overview (qualitative take)
     - Insider transactions overview (qualitative take)
     - Key risks and catalysts
     - Quick-trade considerations for traders
     - Markdown table at the end organizing the key points (placeholders until data arrives)

What I will deliver in each path
- If you want me to retry: I’ll re-run the same set of tools and report back with the actual results (data-driven) and a detailed, trader-focused analysis.
- If you want me to switch to an alternative approach: I’ll compile a qualitative fundamentals narrative for META with clear caveats about lacking exact figures from the latest period.
- If you want a placeholder report now: I’ll produce a fully structured report with sections and a Markdown table of placeholders, ready to fill once data is available.

Would you like me to:
A) Retry fetching the data now, B) proceed with a qualitative analysis based on publicly reported fundamentals, or C) produce a placeholder report template with a final Markdown table of key points to be filled later?  
If you pick A, I’ll attempt the data pull again immediately. If you pick B or C, I’ll proceed accordingly and deliver the report structure right away.
