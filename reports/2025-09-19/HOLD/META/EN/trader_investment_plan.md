Decision: Hold META for now.

Rationale
- The supplied investment plan argues META has meaningful long-term optionality (AI-enabled monetization, licensing, ecosystem moat), but near-term risks are substantial: ad-market cyclicality, Reality Labs cash burn, regulatory pressures, and a rich valuation that hinges on several uncertain catalysts.
- Given the mix of potential upside and near-term headwinds, the plan rightfully advocates a Hold to preserve optionality while avoiding overpaying for uncertain near-term catalysts.

Catalysts to monitor (with triggers to upgrade to Buy)
- Licensing milestones: signed deals with recognized revenue recognition and measurable timing. Trigger to Buy if licensing revenue is recognized and sustained meaningfully across multiple quarters.
- AI yield uplift: durable, material ROAS/ARPU improvements across a representative advertiser mix and regions, sustained for 2–3 quarters. Trigger to Buy on verifiable, broad-based yield uplift.
- Hardware monetization progress: evidence of improved cash flow, stabilized or reduced burn, or meaningful tilt of revenue mix toward services/licensing. Trigger to Buy if cash-burn stabilizes and services/licensing contribute a credible offset.
- Regulatory clarity: concrete progress reducing risk of large fines or delays; management commentary signaling controllable costs and timelines.
- Connect 2025 milestones: tangible product demos, adoption metrics, and engagement data implying durable monetization beyond hype. Trigger to Buy on credible, repeatable monetization signals.

Risk controls and management
- Hedge exposure around key catalyst windows to protect against downside surprises.
- If META falls 10–15% from current levels without a corroborated catalyst, reassess thesis and consider reducing exposure or shifting to neutral.
- Time horizon: 6–12 months for catalyst-driven re-evaluation; re-weight toward Buy only if multiple catalysts prove durable.

Operational discipline
- Avoid chasing headlines; rely on corroborated data across licensing, AI yield, and hardware / services monetization metrics.
- Maintain a data-driven stance; track licensing revenue indicators, ad-yield metrics, platform monetization progress, and capex/opex trajectories.

Conclusion
- The balance of risks and optionality supports a Hold stance at this juncture. Upgrade to Buy only when a concrete, verifiable set of catalysts proves durable across multiple quarters and is embedded in a credible pathway to monetization.

If you want, I can summarize this into a compact one-page note with a crisp bull-counterpoints section and a probabilistic framework for base/bull/bear scenarios tailored to a 6–12 month horizon.
