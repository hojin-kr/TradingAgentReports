# Investment Report: META
## Executive Summary
META has potential beyond ads through licensing, AI monetization, and ecosystem leverage, but near-term catalysts are unclear. Risks include ad-market softness, Reality Labs losses, regulatory costs, and a high valuation.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Long-run optionality exists: licensing deals, AI-driven ad improvements, and an ecosystem that could monetize platforms beyond ads.
- Near-term catalysts are uncertain, so keeping a Hold preserves optionality without overpaying.
- A careful, phased upgrade would require clear, multi-quarter progress across licensing, AI yield, hardware monetization, and regulatory clarity.

## Risks To Watch
- Ad-market softness and cyclical pressure on short-term profits.
- Reality Labs hardware losses with unclear ROI.
- Regulatory scrutiny and higher costs from rules and enforcement.
- Competition from rivals (e.g., TikTok) potentially reducing pricing power.
- High valuation; upside needs multiple durable catalysts rather than a single event.
