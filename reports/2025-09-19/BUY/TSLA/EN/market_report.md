I tried to fetch TSLA data (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-19) from Yahoo Finance, but the data backend returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source hook is not accessible in this environment right now. I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with an indicator plan and a detailed qualitative framework in the meantime. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry data retrieval now
- Proceed with a structured indicator framework (no live numbers yet)
- Provide a rough scenario-based analysis you can use immediately (without live data)

Proposed 8 indicators (diverse, complementary, and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to confirm via crossovers with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major regime (bullish/bearish) and golden/death cross contexts.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Quick momentum shifts; helps flag timely entries when aligned with trend.
- macd: MACD line signal of momentum via EMA differences; useful for trend-change cues when crossing or diverging with price.
- macds: MACD signal line. Crossover with MACD line often used to trigger entries/exits; works best when combined with other filters.
- macdh: MACD histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and helps spot divergence earlier than line crossovers.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold cues and potential reversals; consider divergence with price and trend context.
- atr: Average True Range. Measures volatility; key for setting stops, position sizing, and adjusting risk per trade.

Rationale for this selection
- Combines trend (50/200 SMA) with momentum (MACD family and RSI) and volatility (ATR) to provide a well-rounded view.
- Avoids redundancy (e.g., not including StochRSI or multiple RSI variants) while ensuring both immediate momentum and longer-term trend signals are captured.
- The mix is suitable for a typically volatile name like TSLA, where volatility-aware risk management (ATR) and momentum confirmation (MACD family) are valuable.

What I can deliver once data is available
- A detailed trend analysis with current readings, signal alignments, and a practical trading plan (entry, exit, stop levels, and risk notes) based on the eight indicators above.
- A concise summary of potential scenarios (e.g., trend continuation vs. reversal) and how to respond given different indicator configurations.

Markdown table: Key indicators overview
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use (trade signals) |
|---------|----------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA confirms up/down trend; cross with price for pullbacks or breakouts |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend; major regime indicator | Price above 200SMA suggests bullish regime; golden cross with shorter MA strengthens bullish bias |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price cross above/below 10 EMA signals quick momentum shifts; use with longer MA trend for filtering |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMAs; trend-change cues | MACD line cross, or divergence with price, signals potential entry/exit when aligned with trend |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD; signal cross | MACD line vs MACD signal cross to trigger trades; confirm with price/other indicators |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Increasing histogram indicates strengthening momentum; watch for histogram reversals around zero line |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold | RSI around extremes (e.g., >70 or <30) suggests reversal risk; confirm with trend direction |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility; risk management | Higher ATR -> widen stops and adjust position size; lower ATR implies tighter stops and potentially tighter risk |

Next steps
- Please confirm how you’d like to proceed:
  1) Retry the data fetch now and then I’ll run the indicator analysis and deliver a detailed TSLA report with current readings.
  2) If you prefer, I can provide a scenario-based, data-agnostic analysis using typical TSLA behaviors and explain how to apply the 8 indicators in those scenarios.
  3) If you have access to a TSLA CSV you can share, I can run the indicators against that data immediately.

Once data access is restored, I’ll generate the full, nuanced report with trend insights, actionable signals, and a final TL;DR for quick decisions.
