I tried to pull TSLA Reddit stock info for 2025-09-19, but the data fetch failed due to an internal tool error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data pull now, or I can proceed with a structured plan using the latest available signals I can access elsewhere. Please tell me which you prefer.

Option A: Retry now
- I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again immediately and then deliver a full, detailed report combining social sentiment (daily by day over the past week), notable posts, and recent company news, plus trading-oriented insights and a final Markdown summary table.

Option B: Proceed with a plan-based report (no live Reddit pull)
- I’ll give you a comprehensive framework and an in-depth analysis template based on sentiment patterns and recent news signals, with placeholders where live data would go. You can provide the data later or confirm once the fetch succeeds.

If you want me to proceed with retries, I’ll run the data fetch again right away and then deliver:
- Executive snapshot for TSLA
- Daily sentiment heatmap for the past 7 days
- Top themes and post-level highlights (quality signals, notable influencers, credibility cues)
- Recent company news and its potential impact
- Interpretive analysis with trader-oriented implications (volatility, catalysts, and risk considerations)
- A concise Markdown table organizing key points by date, sentiment, news catalyst, and trading implications

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull now (Option A) or proceed with the plan-based report (Option B)?
