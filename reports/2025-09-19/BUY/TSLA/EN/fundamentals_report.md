Update: I attempted to fetch TSLA data through the available tools (Finnhub insider sentiment/transactions and SimFin balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) but all calls returned a FileNotFoundError indicating the data source interface is not accessible right now. I can’t retrieve the latest fundamentals or insider activity at the moment.

What I can do now
- Option A: Retry automatically in a few minutes and report back with the full fundamental report once the data sources are available.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, framework-focused fundamental analysis for TSLA that outlines what I would look for and how it would inform trading decisions, with placeholders where the data will go once retrieved.
- Option C: If you have alternative data inputs (e.g., you can share numbers or point me to another data feed), I can integrate them into the report immediately.

Proposed plan for the TSLA fundamentals report (to be completed with data once tools are available)
- Executive snapshot
  - Business overview: core segments (vehicles, energy, services), geographic exposure, competitive positioning.
  - Recent headline drivers: production ramp, new model launches, energy products, software/services growth, regulatory/compliance items.
- Company profile and history
  - Market capitalization range, share count, key governance notes, management team, major corporate events.
- Core financials (latest quarter and trailing year)
  - Income statement: revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EBITDA, margins (gross, operating, net), earnings per share.
  - Balance sheet: assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity metrics (current assets vs current liabilities, working capital, cash & equivalents).
  - Cash flow: operating cash flow, investing cash flow, financing cash flow, free cash flow.
  - Key ratios: gross margin trend, operating margin trend, return metrics (ROA, ROE), debt metrics (debt/equity, interest coverage).
- Financial history and trend analysis
  - 4-8 quarters/years of data (revenue growth rate, margin progression, capital expenditure intensity, free cash flow trajectory).
  - Liquidity and solvency evolution (cash, revolver usage if any, debt maturities).
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions
  - Sentiment tone over the past 15 days (positive/neutral/negative), notable themes (executive priorities, strategic shifts).
  - Insider trading activity (purchases vs. sales, size, timing, potential implications for confidence and risk tolerances).
- Segment and geography analysis
  - Vehicle demand and margins by model/region (if data available), energy generation/storage profitability, supercharger/subscription services impact.
- Risks and catalysts
  - Supply chain, component costs (e.g., battery materials), regulatory environment, competition, capital allocation signals (share repurchases, dividends, debt issuance).
  - Near-term catalysts (production milestones, product introductions, software updates, energy product deployments) and potential headwinds.
- Trader-focused interpretation and actionable signals
  - How the fundamentals line up with current price action, implied expectations, and risk factors for TSLA.
  - Short-term and medium-term trading implications (e.g., if margins compress or improve, if cash flow remains robust, if insider signals align with outlook).
- Data gaps and caveats
  - Note where data is pending, why the interpretation may change with new filings, and how to monitor for updates.

Proposed Markdown table to accompany the report (to be populated with the concrete figures after data retrieval)
- I will append a Markdown table at the end of the final report that succinctly captures the key points.

Suggested table structure (will be filled with actual data once available)
- Columns: Section, Key Data Points, Latest Quarter, QoQ/YoY Trend, Interpretation, Trader Implications, Data Source
- Rows: Executive Snapshot, Fundamental Details (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), Financial History, Insider Sentiment, Insider Transactions, Segment & Geography, Risks & Catalysts, Final Takeaways

Next steps
- I can retry the data calls automatically in a few minutes, or you can specify which option you prefer (retry vs. proceed with a qualitative framework now).
- If you’d like me to proceed with Option B (qualitative framework) now, I’ll provide a detailed, trader-focused fundamental analysis using the structure above and clearly mark where data would be inserted once the tools respond.

Please let me know which path you prefer.
