# Investment Report: PLTR
## Executive Summary
Palantir’s growth potential rests on expanding in the UK, achieving CMMC Level 2, and cross-selling Foundry/Gotham to commercial clients, improving revenue visibility and margins. Buy with staged, risk-controlled exposure due to lumpy revenue and high valuation.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Buy. Confidence: Medium-High.

- Use a staged entry to manage risk and scale exposure only if catalysts materialize and progress is confirmed.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- UK expansion and CMMC Level 2: These developments can extend revenue visibility beyond the U.S. and lift the mix toward higher-quality, recurring revenue tied to platforms.
- Platform cross-sell to commercial clients: Expands the total addressable market and supports margin leverage as platform-based revenue grows.
- Diversification benefits: Reduces reliance on government contracts, potentially improving stability and ARR (annual recurring revenue) growth.
- Risk-managed approach increases upside potential: The plan grows exposure only if milestones are met, helping balance upside with controls.

## Risks To Watch
- Revenue visibility may remain lumpy; backlog quality and renewal rates are unclear.
- Valuation is high; the stock could underperform if near-term profitability and cash flow don’t improve as expected.
- Execution risk in Europe and long procurement cycles; currency movements could affect results.
- Government revenue volatility remains a factor; diversification logic hinges on maintaining backlog quality and ARR growth.
