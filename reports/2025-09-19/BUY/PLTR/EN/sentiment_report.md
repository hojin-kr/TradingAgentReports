Thanks for the attempt. I tried to run the Reddit stock info fetch for PLTR on 2025-09-19, but the tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the fetch, or we can proceed with a best-effort framework now and fill in the data later once the tool is functioning.

Here are two options. Please tell me which you prefer:
- Option 1 — Retry now: I’ll attempt to fetch the Reddit/social sentiment data again and then generate the full long-form analysis with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option 2 — Proceed with a high-level framework: I’ll provide a comprehensive analysis framework and a ready-to-fill Markdown table template, so you can drop in data as soon as the tool works or as you gather sources.

If you’d like Option 2 right away, here’s a detailed framework you can use, plus a ready-made Markdown table skeleton at the end.

Executive snapshot (framework)
- What this would answer: Overall sentiment about PLTR from social media over the past week, notable daily swings, and how sentiment aligns with recent company news and catalysts. Implications for traders: potential short-term volatility, sentiment-driven moves around earnings or contract announcements, and risk factors to monitor.
- Data you’d expect to collect: Reddit post volume, sentiment polarity (positive/neutral/negative) by day, top discussed topics, standout memes/themes, notable influencers or communities driving sentiment, and any explicit catalysts mentioned in posts.
- Key takeaways you’d look for: persistent bullishness on specific AI/data analytics themes, any material shift to bearish sentiment around regulatory or contract-related concerns, and whether sentiment correlates with any public news events.

Social sentiment methodology (how I would analyze)
- Data sources: Reddit threads (primary), other relevant social channels if available, and corresponding news pulse for corroboration.
- Timeframe: Past 7 days (or your chosen window).
- Sentiment scoring: Daily polarity scores with breakdowns (positive/neutral/negative) and a simple daily sentiment index (e.g., sum of positive posts minus negative posts, normalized by total posts).
- Topics/tags to track: AI/ML capabilities, DoD/government contracts, earnings/financial results, partnerships, privacy/security concerns, governance/regulatory updates, competitive positioning (vs. peers).
- Confidence/trust indicators: Volume spikes, identified credible sources, and cross-checks against major news events.

What the daily sentiment report would look like (structure)
- Day-by-day sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative) with a 7-day trend.
- Top topics driving sentiment on each day.
- Any notable surges tied to a specific post, tweet, or article.
- Notable influencers or communities contributing to the sentiment spike.

Recent news signals to monitor (categories to watch)
- Government/DoD contracts and modernization programs (new awards, contract expansions, or terminations).
- Earnings and guidance (revenue growth, profitability trajectory, segment mix).
- AI product announcements, partnerships, or integrations (especially around analytics, data fusion, or platform capabilities).
- Regulatory or geopolitical developments affecting data/privacy, exports, or government procurement.
- Market positioning and competitive dynamics (peers like Snowflake, Databricks, etc.).

Implications for traders and investors (forward-looking)
- Short-term catalysts: Any upcoming earnings dates, contract news, or regulatory updates that could drive sentiment and volatility.
- Medium-term thesis: If sentiment aligns with strong government demand and enterprise adoption, PLTR could see sustainable upside; if sentiment turns skeptical due to macro or competitive concerns, downside could broaden.
- Risk considerations: Sentiment can overshoot on meme-like posts or influencer chatter; verify with fundamentals and news flow. Also be mindful of government procurement cycles and budgetary constraints.

Notable risks and counterpoints to watch
- Dependency on government contracts: Government procurement cycles can be lumpy; a single large award or loss can swing sentiment and stock moves.
- Competitive pressure: Enterprise data analytics and AI platforms are increasingly crowded; customer diversification and retention metrics matter.
- Regulatory/compliance exposure: Data governance and privacy developments could impact product customization and deployment speed.

Ready-to-fill Markdown table (structure you can paste into a report)
- This table is designed to capture day-by-day sentiment and key drivers. Replace the placeholders with actual data once you have the Reddit/news data.

Markdown table skeleton (copy-paste-ready)
- Date | Source | Volume (posts) | Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) | Sentiment Score | Top Topics / Catalysts | Notable Posts or Events | Data Confidence

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option 1 and retry the Reddit data fetch now. Just say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt again and then deliver the full long-form, data-backed report with a Markdown table appended. If you prefer Option 2, I’ll generate a complete long report using the framework above, and we can populate the data once the tool is functioning or you supply the sources.
