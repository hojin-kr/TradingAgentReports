I ran into a data retrieval error trying to fetch PLTR data and the associated indicator reports. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, which means the data module isn’t accessible right now. I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with the indicator framework you asked for using a best-available plan. Here I’ll propose a solid, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for PLTR, along with how to interpret them once the data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma: 50-period simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for identifying mid-term trend and confirming with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-period simple moving average. Long-term trend confirmation; helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death cross patterns) and provides strategic context.
- close_10_ema: 10-period exponential moving average. Captures short-term momentum shifts; good for timely entry/exit signals when used with longer-term averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum gauge; crossovers with the signal line indicate potential trend changes; useful in confirming trend with other signals.
- macds: MACD Signal. The EMA-smoothed MACD line; crossovers with MACD help trigger trades in a broader trend framework.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator showing overbought/oversold conditions; watch for divergences and cross-check with trend direction.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing; helps adapt to changing market conditions.
- vwma: VWMA. Volume-weighted moving average; confirms trends by integrating price action with volume, reducing false signals when volume validates moves.

Why this set is suitable for PLTR now
- PLTR often exhibits trends that are best understood through both price levels (50/200 SMA) and near-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD family, RSI). The combination of short-, mid-, and long-term trend indicators helps you gauge alignment across timeframes.
- Including MACD alongside RSI provides a balance between momentum-based entries (MACD) and momentum extremes (RSI), reducing reliance on a single signal.
- ATR and VWMA add a practical risk-management and volume-confirmation layer, which is important for a stock with evolving volatility and liquidity dynamics.
- This mix avoids redundancy (they cover trend, momentum, volatility, and volume without duplicating the same signal type excessively).

Next steps
- I can retry fetching PLTR data and the 8 indicators now. Please confirm you’d like me to attempt the data retrieval again.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with an interim qualitative interpretation framework using these indicators once data is available (without numeric values) and provide actionable signals as soon as the data arrives.

Appendix: quick reference table (read later with data)
Indicator | What it measures | How to read signals | Typical actionable interpretation
- close_50_sma | Mid-term trend level | Price above/below 50 SMA suggests up/down trend; cross with price for support/resistance | Use as a trend filter for entries
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend; major regime | Price above/below 200 SMA indicates bull/bear regime | Favor trend-aligned entries, watch for golden/death cross with 50SMA
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price cross above/below 10 EMA signals near-term momentum shifts | Consider quick entries/exits if aligned with longer-term trend
- macd | Momentum difference between fast/slow EMAs | MACD line crossing the Signal line signals potential moves; histogram strength confirms | Use crossovers with other signals for entry timing
- macds | MACD signal line | Crosses with MACD line to trigger trades | Confirm with price and other indicators
- rsi | Momentum/overbought-oversold | >70 overbought; <30 oversold; look for divergences | Reversals or corrections may be indicated when aligned with trend
- atr | Volatility level | Higher ATR means higher volatility; adjust stops/position sizes accordingly | Use to size risk and place stops beyond typical ranges
- vwma | Volume-weighted trend confirmation | Price action confirmed by volume supports move | Favor trades where price is above/below VWMA with strong volume

If you’d like, I’ll retry the data fetch right away and then generate a detailed, data-backed narrative including trend observations, signal confirmations, and a practical trade plan based on the 8 indicators above.
