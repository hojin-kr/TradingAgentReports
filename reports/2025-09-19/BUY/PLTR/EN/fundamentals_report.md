I tried to pull the requested fundamental data for PLTR (Palantir) using the available tools, but I hit a runtime issue:

- Parallel tool run returned FileNotFoundError: "No such file or directory" for all calls (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, insider sentiment, insider transactions).
- Re-running the balance sheet call individually produced the same FileNotFoundError.

Because of this environment error, I don’t have the actual quarterly data (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) or insider activity to analyze yet. I can retry data pulls now, or proceed with a high-quality qualitative framework and a structured report outline that you can fill in once data becomes available. Which would you prefer? I can do one of the following:
- Retry data pulls immediately and then generate a full, data-driven fundamental report for PLTR.
- Or, deliver a comprehensive qualitative report now (without numeric figures) outlining what to look for, how to interpret the data, and a ready-to-fill Markdown table for your notes and decisions.

If you’d like me to proceed with a qualitative-only approach right away, here is a thorough framework I will fill in with data as soon as the tool calls succeed:

What I will cover in the comprehensive PLTR fundamental report
- Company overview and business model
  - Core products: Foundry (platform for data integration/analytics) and Gotham (government-focused) — distribution between government and commercial revenue
  - Market positioning, competitive landscape, and growth drivers (AI/ML deployment, data-commercial adoption, international expansion)
  - Revenue model and monetization tactics (subscription/SAAS-like licensing, service revenue, support)

- Financial statements (subject to latest quarterly/annual reports)
  - Income statement highlights
    - Revenue growth (QoQ and YoY), gross margin, operating margin, EBITDA, net income
    - R&D vs SG&A spend trajectory; scale efficiency
    - Any one-time items or non-recurring charges
  - Balance sheet highlights
    - Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, working capital, debt levels
    - Intangible assets and goodwill considerations
    - Shareholder equity and share count changes
  - Cash flow statement highlights
    - Operating cash flow and conversion to free cash flow
    - Cash capex/development investments
    - Financing activities (debt issuance/repayment, share repurchases, dividends if any)
  - Key financial ratios and trend analysis
    - Liquidity (current ratio, quick ratio), solvency (debt/EBITDA where applicable)
    - Efficiency (ROE, ROIC, asset turnover)
    - Cash flow health vs profitability

- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days window)
  - Insider sentiment signal (overall tone and any notable shifts)
  - Insider purchases/sales activity (recency, size, and potential implications)
  - Relationship between sentiment/transactions and price movement (contextual interpretation)

- Revenue mix and customer concentration
  - Government vs commercial revenue mix and any trends toward diversification
  - Key customers, contract sizes, renewal rates, and sales cycle dynamics
  - Concentration risk and exposure to government budgets or regulatory changes

- Growth prospects and catalysts
  - Product roadmap alignment with enterprise AI trends
  - Expansion opportunities in non-government sectors, data sovereignty, and cloud partnerships
  - Potential tailwinds (AI adoption, digital transformation budgets) and risks (budget constraints, procurement hurdles)

- Risks and mitigants
  - Dependency on large/long sales cycles, competitive pressures, and pricing
  - Regulatory/compliance exposure and data governance considerations
  - Customer concentration risk, geographic exposure, and currency risk
  - Technology risk (integration, platform reliability, data security)

- Valuation context and trading implications
  - How current fundamentals compare to market expectations
  - Margin and cash flow trajectory versus valuation multiples (EV/Revenue, price/book, etc.)
  - Short-term catalysts (earnings, contract wins, government budget cycles) and potential risk factors

- Summary of key takeaways for traders
  - What the latest quarterly fundamentals imply for near-term price action
  - Areas to monitor next quarter (data points to update)
  - Any mispricings or market sentiment disconnects suggested by the fundamental backdrop

Proposed Markdown table at the end (to organize key points)
- I will fill this table with actual data once the tool calls succeed. For now, it’s a ready-to-use template to keep things organized.

Markdown table (structure to fill with PLTR data)
- Section | Key Point | Latest Source | Data Point / Interpretation | Trading Implication
- Company Profile | Business model and products | Company filings / press |  | 
- Revenue & Profitability | Revenue growth, gross/operating margins | Income statement |  | 
- Balance Sheet | Liquidity and leverage | Balance sheet |  | 
- Cash Flow | Operating cash flow and free cash flow | Cash flow statement |  | 
- Insider Activity | Sentiment and transactions (past 15 days) | Finnhub reports |  | 
- Revenue Mix | Gov vs Commercial diversification | segment data / management commentary |  | 
- Risks | Key downside factors | risk disclosures |  | 
- Catalysts | Near-term catalysts | company guidance / market news |  | 
- Valuation | Relative valuation vs peers | market data |  | 
- Takeaways | Primary implications for traders | synthesis |  | 

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry the data pulls now and then generate the fully data-driven report? If yes, I’ll run the tools again and compile the insights as soon as responses come back.
- Or, if you prefer a qualitative-only report immediately (without numeric figures) to discuss strategic implications and trading considerations, I can deliver that right away and then update with data once available.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and if you have any particular focus (e.g., heavier emphasis on government revenue stability vs. commercial growth, or specific ratios you care about).
