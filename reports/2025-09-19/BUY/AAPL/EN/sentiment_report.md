Thanks for the quick follow-up. I attempted to pull Reddit-focused stock news for AAPL on 2025-09-19 but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch the Reddit data in this session right now. I don’t want to stall your analysis, so here are two solid options and a ready-to-use plan you can pick from:

Option A — Proceed with a complete analysis using non-Reddit sources (news, public sentiment proxies, etc.)
- I’ll compile a comprehensive long-form report focusing on:
  - Public sentiment proxies (non-Reddit) for the past week
  - Apple news headlines and events from major outlets
  - Company communications (press releases, earnings calls, product updates)
  - Near-term catalysts, sentiment drivers, and potential trader implications
  - A forward-looking view with risk factors and tradeable signals
- I’ll still append a Markdown table at the end summarizing key points.

Option B — Wait for Reddit data and proceed once the tool is fixed
- I’ll retry fetching Reddit stock news for AAPL on 2025-09-19 and then deliver the same long-form analysis with Reddit-specific sentiment insights included.

If you’d like, I can start right away with Option A and provide a detailed, trader-focused report using available non-Reddit sources, along with a placeholder for Reddit insights to be filled in once the tool is working.

Plan for Option A (What I’ll deliver)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment posture, notable news catalysts, and implied risk/reward for the next 1–2 weeks.
- Social sentiment (non-Reddit) overview:
  - Daily sentiment trends (positive/neutral/negative) for the past 7 days
  - Notable sentiment drivers (e.g., product news, regulatory/regression headlines, supply-chain chatter)
  - Discussion themes (e.g., iPhone demand, Services growth, AI/AR rumors, legal/regulatory risk)
- News & events (past 7 days):
  - Key headlines from major outlets, earnings-related notes, product announcements, guidance changes
  - Any regulatory or macro factors impacting Apple
- Sentiment drivers and implications:
  - Short-term catalysts or headwinds
  - How sentiment aligns or diverges from price action and volatility
- Trader implications:
  - Potential trading ideas (scenarios, risk checks, and levels to watch)
  - Risk flags and hedging considerations
- Quantified framing (where possible):
  - Approximate sentiment scores or qualitative sentiment levels
  - Notable price/volume correlations (if data available from generic sources)
- Risks and caveats:
  - Data gaps, potential biases in sentiment signals, reliance on headlines vs. fundamentals

Proposed output format
- A detailed narrative report (roughly 1–3 pages)
- A concise bullet list of actionable takeaways for traders
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points (see sample below)

Before I proceed, please tell me which option you prefer. If you want Option A now, I’ll generate the full report immediately with non-Reddit sources and a placeholder section for Reddit to be filled later. If you want to retry Reddit right away, I’ll attempt the Reddit fetch again and deliver once it succeeds.

Sample Markdown table (to be appended at the end)
| Section / Metric | What to look for | Current status (placeholder if data not yet fetched) | Trading implications (brief) |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Public sentiment (7d) | Positive/Neutral/Negative balance | [Pending Reddit data] or [Non-Reddit proxies] | If negative and price rising, watch for pullback risk; if positive with momentum, consider upside exposure |
| Key news catalysts | Product/earnings/newsflow | [List of headlines from major outlets] | Identify catalysts that may drive moves in the near term |
| Price action correlation | Sentiment vs. price/volatility | [N/A until data gathered] | Look for divergence/convergence signals |
| Risks | Regulatory, supply chain, macro | [Summary] | Hedge or adjust risk exposure if risk spikes |

If you want me to proceed with Option A right away, say “Proceed with Option A.” If you want me to retry Reddit immediately, say “Retry Reddit data now.”
