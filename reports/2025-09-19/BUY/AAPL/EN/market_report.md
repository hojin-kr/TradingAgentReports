I attempted to fetch AAPL data and run the selected indicators, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. That means I can’t retrieve the latest price series right now. If you’d like, I can retry shortly or with a different date range. In the meantime, here’s a solid, non-redundant set of indicators (8 total) that gives complementary insights for a typical AAPL setup and how I’d interpret them once data is available.

Selected indicators (8 total) and why they’re suitable
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Captures short-term momentum shifts; reacts quickly to price moves. Useful for early entries in a trending or swinging market.
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level. Helps filter noise from the short term.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful to confirm the broader regime (bullish vs bearish) and to spot golden/death cross signals when combined with the 50 SMA.
- macd (MACD Line)
  - Why: Core momentum measure; crossovers with the MACD signal can indicate shifts in trend strength.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Why: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line can validate entry/exit signals and reduce false positives.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Why: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence; helps gauge how quickly momentum is changing and can flag fading moves.
- rsi (Momentum)
  - Why: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold levels; useful for spotting reversals or confirming momentum against trend context.
- atr (Volatility)
  - Why: Measures market volatility; critical for setting stops, position sizing, and understanding risk under current conditions.

How I’d analyze once data is available (nuanced, not just “up” or “down”)
- Trend context:
  - Compare price relative to the 50 SMA and 200 SMA. If price is above both and the 50 SMA is above the 200 SMA (or is crossing upward), that supports a bullish bias. If price sits below both with the 50 SMA below the 200 SMA, that supports a bearish bias.
  - Look for golden/death cross patterns: 50 SMA crossing above/below 200 SMA adds conviction to trend signals.
- Momentum signals:
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal (and a positive histogram) supports bullish momentum; a cross below suggests bearish momentum. Confirm with RSI to avoid whipsaws in choppy markets.
  - RSI: readings near or above 70 suggest overbought conditions in uptrends (look for potential reversals or continued strength if MACD remains bullish). Readings near or below 30 suggest oversold conditions but should be interpreted in context of the trend.
- Momentum strength vs. trend strength:
  - If price is above major moving averages but MACD/MACD histogram is waning (histogram shrinking, MACD near zero or negative), be cautious of a potential pullback or consolidation.
  - If price breaks above a key resistance (near a psychological level or a prior high) while RSI remains under extreme levels and MACD is positive, that can be a stronger breakout signal.
- Volatility and risk management:
  - Use ATR to gauge stop placement and position sizing. A rising ATR implies wider stops and potentially larger position risk, while a contracting ATR could support tighter stops.
  - If ATR is elevated during a breakout, consider confirming with MACD/Rsi to avoid false breakouts in high-volatility regimes.
- Subtle interactions to watch:
  - A rising 10 EMA with price above 50/200 SMAs and a bullish MACD/histogram can indicate a clean uptrend. Conversely, price beneath 50/200 SMAs with a negative MACD/histogram and RSI failing to hold above 50 adds caution for longs or favors shorts.
  - Divergence between RSI and price (e.g., price makes a higher high while RSI fails to reach a new high) can signal exhaustion in the current move, especially if MACD histogram also weakens.

Proposed next steps
- I will re-run data retrieval and indicator calculations as soon as the data tool is accessible again.
- If you want, I can adjust the date range (e.g., last 6–12 months) or focus on a specific event window (like around earnings or a recent pullback) to sharpen the narrative.
- I can also provide a structured trading plan based on the 8 indicators once I have the actual values (entry/exit levels, stop placement, risk per trade).

Markdown table: key points to remember about these indicators
- Indicator category
- Key insight you get
- Practical trading takeaway
- How it complements other indicators

| Indicator | Category | Key insight | Practical takeaway | How it complements others |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Use for quick entry/exit cues in trends | Complement with 50/200 SMA for trend filtering |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction | Assess overall trend; supports/resistance | Cross with 200 SMA for golden/death cross signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend context | Strategic trend confirmation | Helps validate signals from 10 EMA and 50 SMA |
| macd | MACD Line | Momentum crossovers | Trigger bullish/bearish entries when crossing | Validate with macds and macdh to reduce noise |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothed momentum signal | Confirm MACD-derived signals | Synchronizes with macd for stronger signals |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength/divergence | Spot acceleration or fading momentum | Adds depth to MACD-based decisions |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold and divergences | Reversal signals; require trend context | Use with MA trend to avoid false reversals |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level | Set stops and sizing; manage risk | Use with price signals to calibrate risk |

Important note
- Data access issue: The data fetch tool is currently returning an error. If you’d like, I can retry now, switch to a narrower window, or proceed with a qualitative framework (as above) while we wait for data retrieval to succeed.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with the qualitative framework and a plan for when the data comes back? If you have a preferred date window (e.g., last 180 days) or a specific event window (recent earnings, market sell-off), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis accordingly once the data is available.
