I tried to fetch the data, but the data tools returned a FileNotFoundError indicating the data files for Finnhub/Simfin are not loaded in the environment right now. I can’t retrieve insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the quarterly balance sheet/cashflow/income statements for AAPL at the moment.

Options to proceed
- Retry now: I can attempt the tool calls again in a moment to see if the data layer comes online.
- Proceed with a partial report: I can draft the comprehensive fundamental report structure (company profile, basic financials, history, insider sentiment/transactions) and clearly indicate where data is missing until the data tools return.
- Provide a data-delivery plan: If you can provide the data sources or paste the key figures (or authorize a data pull from another channel), I’ll immediately generate the full report and the appended Markdown table.
- Build a skeleton report: I can deliver a well-structured template with detailed guidance on what to look for once the data is available, plus a filled-in example of how insights would look.

Proposed plan for the final report (once data is available)
- Executive summary
  - Core takeaways on fundamentals, with emphasis on where Apple shows strength or risk (e.g., margins, cash flow quality, balance sheet liquidity).
- Company profile
  - Business model, segments (iPhone, Services, Mac, Wearables/Other), geographic mix, competitive positioning.
- Basic financials (latest period, quarterly)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS, free cash flow.
  - Key profitability and efficiency metrics (ROIC, gross margin trend, operating margin, cash conversion cycle if available).
- Financial history (historical context)
  - Revenue and earnings trajectory, margin evolution, capital allocation signals (buybacks, dividends, capex).
- Balance sheet (latest quarter)
  - Liquidity (cash, equivalents, short-term investments), debt levels, leverage ratios, net debt.
- Cash flow statement
  - Cash from operating activities, investing activities, financing activities, free cash flow evolution.
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Tone and direction of insider sentiment, notable shifts in leadership or governance commentary.
- Insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Summary of notable buys/sells, size, and potential implications for management confidence.
- Key risk factors and catalysts
  - Device cycles, supply chain exposure, capital allocation moves, regulatory risks, major product launches.
- Quantitative snapshot (appendix)
  - A compact table of the most relevant numbers for quick decision-making.
- Appendices
  - Data sources, methodology, footnotes, and caveats.

Proposed Markdown table (to append at the end)
- I will populate this table with the key points once data is in. Here is the structure I’ll use:

| Topic | Latest Quarter | YoY Trend | Key Insight | Data Source |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Revenue | | | | |
| Gross Margin | | | | |
| Operating Margin | | | | |
| Net Income | | | | |
| EPS | | | | |
| Free Cash Flow | | | | |
| Cash & Equivalents | | | | |
| Debt (Net) | | | | |
| Share Buybacks / Dividends | | | | |
| Insider Sentiment (last 15d) | | | | |
| Insider Transactions (last 15d) | | | | |

Next step options
- Tell me: “Retry now” if you want me to attempt the data fetch again immediately.
- Tell me: “Proceed with skeleton/template” if you’d like me to deliver the full report structure and a data-collection guide right away, with placeholders for the missing data.
- Tell me: “Provide data you have” if you can paste any numbers you already have, and I’ll build the report around those.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or would you prefer I deliver the skeleton/template and wait for data to come through?
