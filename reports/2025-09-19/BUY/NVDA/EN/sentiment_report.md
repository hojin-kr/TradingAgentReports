Sorry — the Reddit data fetch for NVDA on 2025-09-19 failed due to a backend error (FileNotFoundError). I can’t retrieve the Reddit posts for that date right now.

I can do one of the following to proceed:

- Option 1: Retry the Reddit data pull immediately and then produce the full, detailed long report with sentiment by day and a Markdown table at the end.
- Option 2: Proceed with a best-effort analysis using other publicly available sources (e.g., headlines, general social sentiment, and recent news) and provide a comprehensive report with insights and implications, then run the Reddit fetch when the tool becomes available again.
- Option 3: Wait and try again later automatically if you prefer.

Please tell me which option you’d like. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the full report once I have data:

- Overview: Quick snapshot of NVDA’s sentiment signal over the past 7 days and any notable spikes.
- Thematic sentiment analysis by day: What people talked about (e.g., product announcements, earnings chatter, AI demand, supply chain, regulatory/regulatory risk, competition) and how sentiment swung (positive/neutral/negative).
- News and events: Any major NVDA-related news in the period (product launches, earnings, partnerships, regulatory updates) and how those events aligned with social sentiment.
- Price and option context: Any notable price moves, volume, and options signals that may corroborate sentiment (where data is available).
- Risk factors and skew: Key upside/downside risks people are focusing on (geopolitical, demand sustainability, competition, macro tech cycles).
- Trader takeaways: actionable implications for long, short, or neutral positioning, with caveats.
- Table: A concise Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, catalysts, sentiment direction, and risk notes.

If you’d like me to proceed now with Option 1 (retry) or Option 2 (fallback analysis), just say the word.
