Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AMD data to compute the requested indicators, but the data retrieval call is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). That suggests the data source or local data path isn't accessible at the moment. I can:

- Retry fetching the data now (or after a short interval), or
- Proceed with a qualitative framework and prepare the 8 indicators you asked for, so you have a ready plan as soon as the data import succeeds.

If you’re able to retry, I’ll run the data pull and then compute the indicators exactly as requested. In the meantime, here is a detailed setup tailored for AMD (ticker: AMD) in the current context, including a carefully chosen set of indicators and why they’re relevant. I’ve also included a Markdown table at the end to summarize key points.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) and rationale for AMD
- close_50_sma (50 SMA)
  - What it measures: Mid-term trend direction with dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it matters for AMD: AMD often experiences multi-quarter cycles tied to data-center demand, console/PC cycles, and AI-related demand. The 50-day SMA helps identify the intermediate trend and potential pullbacks to a known benchmark during earnings-driven moves.
  - How to use: Use as a trend filter; look for price above/below the 50 SMA to gauge bullish vs bearish bias. Confirm with a faster indicator for timing.

- close_200_sma (200 SMA)
  - What it measures: Long-term trend, broader market context.
  - Why it matters for AMD: Long-term trend helps distinguish secular uptrends (e.g., sustained data-center/server demand) from pullbacks. Golden/death cross with 50 SMA can be a macro signal.
  - How to use: Use for strategic alignment (trend confirmation). Treat crossovers as validation rather than solo signals; pair with momentum indicators for timing.

- close_10_ema (10 EMA)
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price.
  - Why it matters for AMD: Earnings weeks, guide revisions, or catalyst events can trigger rapid moves. The 10 EMA captures early momentum shifts that longer averages might lag on.
  - How to use: Watch for crossovers with the 50 SMA or price crossing above/below the 10 EMA for potential entries/filters. Use with wider trend context to avoid whipsaws.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences between EMAs (fast vs slow momentum change).
  - Why it matters for AMD: In a volatile AI/compute cycle, MACD can highlight momentum shifts around catalysts, helping time entries with trend strength.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossing the MACD signal, or divergences with price. Confirm with a secondary indicator in low-volatility or choppy markets.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: The EMA-smoothed MACD line.
  - Why it matters for AMD: Helps filter MACD cross signals and reduce false positives.
  - How to use: Trigger-like signals when MACD crosses above/below the MACD Signal line; avoid trading on MACD alone.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: Momentum strength via the gap between MACD line and its signal.
  - Why it matters for AMD: Early momentum signals and divergence clues can be valuable when the stock is reacting to AI/data center news.
  - How to use: Use as a momentum strength gauge and to confirm MACD cross signals with larger histogram expansions.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: Relative momentum, overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why it matters for AMD: In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; in choppy markets, RSI can help spot potential reversals or consolidation.
  - How to use: Common 70/30 thresholds, but cross-check with trend direction. Watch for RSI divergence with price as a potential warning sign.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it measures: Average true range (volatility).
  - Why it matters for AMD: AMD can experience outsized moves around earnings and AI-cycle news; ATR helps quantify volatility and informs risk management (stops, position sizing).
  - How to use: Use ATR for stop placement (e.g., 1.5–2 ATR from entry) and adjusting position size to current volatility.

Notes on AMD context (2025 landscape)
- AMD’s stock often experiences sharp moves around earnings, AI/compute demand shifts, and supply chain updates. A mix of trend, momentum, and volatility indicators helps balance timing with risk controls.
- Trend filters (50 SMA, 200 SMA) keep you aligned with the broader move, while momentum (MACD components, RSI) provides timely entry/exit cues around catalysts.
- Volatility awareness (ATR) is critical for setting stops and sizing, given the potential for rapid swings on news or guidance changes.

What I’ll deliver once data access is restored
- A full data pull for AMD from the requested date range.
- Computation of the 8 indicators listed above.
- A detailed, nuanced report describing:
  - The current trend regime (short/medium/long-term) and where AMD sits relative to the 50/200 SMAs.
  - Momentum signals from MACD components and RSI, including any divergences.
  - Volatility context from ATR and how it affects risk management.
  - Likely support/resistance zones informed by moving averages and recent price action.
  - Practical trading implications: potential entry/exit signals, risk controls, and suggested stop placements.

Markdown table: key indicators, purpose, and how to use (summary)
| Indicator | What it measures | Why it matters for AMD (2025 context) | How to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average (mid-term trend) | Helps identify the intermediate trend amid AI/data center cycle fluctuations | Use as trend filter; confirm with faster indicators for timing |
| close_200_sma | 200-day SMA (long-term trend) | Context for secular moves and major regime shifts | Use for strategic trend confirmation; consider golden/death cross with 50 SMA |
| close_10_ema | 10-day exponential moving average (short-term momentum) | Captures quick shifts around catalysts; useful for timely entries | Look for price or 10 EMA crossovers with 50 SMA |
| macd | MACD line (momentum) | Signals momentum changes; helpful around catalysts | Watch cross with MACD Signal; confirm with RSI or ATR in volatile periods |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD to reduce noise | Use with MACD for trigger signals; avoid relying on MACD alone |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and potential divergences | Use to gauge momentum tilt and confirm other signals |
| rsi | RSI (momentum/overbought-oversold) | Divergences can precede reversals; RSI behavior in trends matters | Use 70/30 thresholds with trend context; confirm with price action |
| atr | Average True Range (volatility) | Quantifies current volatility; informs stops and sizing | Set stops at a multiple of ATR; adjust position size according to volatility |

Next steps
- Please let me know if you want me to retry pulling the AMD data now. If you’re okay with it, I’ll re-run the data fetch for AMD and then compute these 8 indicators, followed by a detailed trend report and a trader-ready set of observations with actionable insights.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative interim analysis based on typical AMD patterns and our indicator framework while we troubleshoot the data retrieval. This would give you near-term guidance, albeit without fresh numeric readings.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with the qualitative framework in the meantime?
