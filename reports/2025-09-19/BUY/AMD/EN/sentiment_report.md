Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch the Reddit-based stock sentiment data for AMD for 2025-09-19, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the Reddit data endpoint is currently unavailable on my side. I can retry shortly or switch to a fallback approach, but I don’t want to leave you without progress.

Here are two paths I can take right away:
- Path A (Retry now): I’ll immediately retry the Reddit data fetch and, once it succeeds, generate the full, detailed AMD social-media sentiment report with a 7-day window and the latest news context.
- Path B (Fallback now): I’ll proceed with a robust qualitative/structural report using any available public signals I can access or infer (not fabricating data). I’ll clearly label any data gaps and provide strong frameworks, analyses, and trader-oriented implications that can be updated once Reddit data is available.

If you’d like me to proceed with Path A (retry now), say “Retry now.” If you’d prefer Path B (fallback), say “Fallback now,” and I’ll deliver a thorough report skeleton with placeholders for Reddit data and a detailed trader-focused interpretation.

In the meantime, here is a comprehensive framework and a starter table structure I will fill in once the Reddit data comes through. This will help you see the depth and usefulness of the final report.

Proposed report structure (AMD, as of 2025-09-19)
- Executive snapshot
  - Snapshot of overall sentiment, notable themes, and immediate trading implications.
  - Quick read on whether sentiment is mixed, bullish, or bearish, plus any signs of sentiment extremes.

- Social media sentiment analysis (past 7 days)
  - Daily sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative) with trend lines.
  - Top themes each day (e.g., AI/datacenter momentum, supply chain chatter, gaming GPU demand, pricing strategy, driver/software issues).
  - Key posts and influencers driving sentiment (with rough characterizations of impact).
  - Subreddit focus: which communities (e.g., r/AMD, r/hardware, r/stockmarket, tech-focused subreddits) are most active and which themes dominate.

- Reddit signals (once data is available)
  - Notable threads, upvote velocity, and sentiment shifts.
  - Any correlation between post activity spikes and intraday price moves.

- News and event context (past week)
  - Any AMD product announcements, partnership news, earnings guidance, supply-chain updates, competitive developments (NVIDIA, Intel), or macro factors affecting sentiment.
  - How those items align with or contradict Reddit/retail sentiment.

- Price/volume context (when applicable)
  - Short-term price action around key sentiment events.
  - Volume spikes and any suspected retail-position signals (without unverified speculation).

- Trader-oriented insights and implications
  - Catalysts to watch in the next 1–2 weeks.
  - Potential risks (sentiment crowding, meme dynamics, overreaction).
  - Scenarios for bullish or bearish trades based on sentiment shifts and news flow (e.g., breakouts, pullbacks, volatility changes).

- Risks and data caveats
  - Data limitations, biases in social-media data, and how I’ll handle them.

Makrdown table (key points). I’ll populate this fully once the Reddit data is retrieved, but here’s a ready-to-fill scaffold you can rely on.

- Table header example (to be filled after data collection):
  - Key Driver
  - Sentiment Trend (Past 7 days)
  - Notable Posts / Threads
  - Major News/Events
  - Trader Implications

Proposed ready-to-fill table (structure only)
- Key Driver | Sentiment Trend (Past 7 Days) | Notable Posts/Threads | Major News/Events | Trader Implications
- AI/Data Center momentum | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled]
- Gaming GPUs demand commentary | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled]
- Price/valuation chatter | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled]
- Supply chain / margins talk | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled]
- Competitive concerns (NVIDIA/Intel) | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled] | [to be filled]

Please tell me which path you want:
- “Retry now” to re-attempt the Reddit data fetch and generate the full, data-backed report.
- “Fallback now” to proceed with a thorough qualitative analysis and a detailed framework, clearly labeling data gaps to be filled once Reddit data becomes available.

I’m ready to proceed as soon as you confirm.
