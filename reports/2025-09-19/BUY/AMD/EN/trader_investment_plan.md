Recommendation: BUY AMD with a disciplined, hedged, staged deployment. The multi-vector AI/data-center growth thesis (MI accelerators, EPYC, ROCm software ecosystem, and embedded/edge) supports a durable upside, while diversified catalysts reduce reliance on any single event. Risk management is essential given near-term macro/policy headwinds and Nvidia’s dominance.

Rationale (condensed)
- Durable demand across multiple AMD platforms: accelerators (MI), CPUs (EPYC), ROCm software moat, and embedded/edge variants create a broader TAM than hardware alone.
- ROCm openness could reduce CUDA lock-in and expand enterprise/hyperscaler adoption, unlocking longer-term TAM expansion.
- Margin upside possible from mix shift, software monetization, and higher-value deployments; diversification across data-center, embedded/edge, and software mitigates cyclicality.
- Manageable risk profile with disciplined hedging and staged exposure; avoids overreliance on a single catalyst.

Actionable, trader-ready plan (sample framework you can customize)
1) Positioning and scale
- Starter exposure: begin with 3–5% of trading/book value allocated to AMD now.
- Target exposure: scale to 8–12% of book value as ROCm adoption milestones and MI/EPYC ramp become evident.

2) Entry points and timing
- Favor entries on pullbacks to the 50–100 day moving average or during consolidations.
- Consider adding on a clean breakout tied to ROCm milestones, enterprise deployments, or MI350/MI355X ramp signals.

3) Risk controls and hedging
- Use a hedged approach (collar-like) to limit downside:
  - Long AMD shares.
  - Buy puts 5–10% OTM with 6–12 months duration.
  - Sell calls at a higher strike to offset premium costs.
- Alternative simpler approach: long stock with ATR-based stop (e.g., 1–2x ATR below entry) plus a smaller protective put for longer-term protection.
- Position-sizing discipline: start small, escalate only on confirmed catalysts and durable ROCm/MI/EPYC traction.

4) Catalysts to monitor
- ROCm milestones: enterprise deployments, developer momentum, cross-architecture support, parity with CUDA on key workloads.
- MI350/MI355X ramp and data-center unit growth visibility.
- EPYC Embedded/edge traction and related revenue mix shifts.
- FSR software uptake and monetization signals.
- Policy/export developments or macro shifts impacting AI capex.

5) Data discipline and decision rules
- Treat data gaps as labeled assumptions; pause or reduce exposure if ROCm adoption stalls over consecutive quarters.
- Use scenario planning (base/bull/bear) with explicit probabilities and predefined exit thresholds if catalysts underperform.

6) Exit and rebalancing
- If ROCm adoption remains muted for two consecutive quarterly reports, reduce exposure or re-hedge.
- If macro risk intensifies or Nvidia-driven headwinds widen, tighten risk controls and consider trimming.

Suggested concrete numbers you can tailor
- Entry band: target purchases around current price level but be prepared to average into pullbacks to the 50–100 day moving average or on a confirmed breakout.
- Hedge quantities: construct a collar with puts 5–10% OTM and calls 10–15% OTM to offset cost; adjust strike levels as exposure grows.
- Stop guidance: implement ATR-based stops (e.g., 1–2x ATR) to cap downside per tranche.
