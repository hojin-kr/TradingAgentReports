# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD has multiple growth paths beyond chips—AI accelerators, data-center CPUs, ROCm software moat, and embedded/edge products. A disciplined, hedged, staged buy aims to capture upside while keeping risk manageable.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: BUY with a disciplined, hedged, staged plan.
Confidence level: Medium-High

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Diversified growth potential: AMD can grow beyond hardware through MI accelerators, EPYC CPUs, ROCm software moat, and embedded/edge opportunities, potentially expanding the total addressable market.
- ROCm as a long-term lever: An open software ecosystem could reduce reliance on a single platform (CUDA) and attract more workloads over time, supporting multi-year TAM expansion.
- Measured entry, optional upside: Start with a small position and increase exposure as ROCm/MI/EPYC milestones prove progress, balancing upside with risk controls.
- Risk controls through structure: The plan uses hedges and staged exposure to limit downside if catalysts lag or macro headwinds rise.

## Risks To Watch
- Competitive leadership: Nvidia’s strong position in AI compute could limit near-term upside for AMD.
- Execution risk: Delays or weaker monetization from ROCm, MI accelerators, or EPYC growth could slow progress.
- Policy and macro headwinds: Export controls, geopolitical frictions, and broader macro softness could affect AI capex timing.
- Hedge costs and complexity: Cost and management of hedges could dampen upside if catalysts arrive earlier than planned.
- Data gaps and milestones: Uncertainty around milestone timing requires disciplined exposure and clear exit rules.
