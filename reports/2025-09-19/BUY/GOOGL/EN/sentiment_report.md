I attempted to pull Reddit sentiment data for GOOGL across 2025-09-19 to 2025-09-13, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all requests (including the single latest date). I can’t access Reddit-derived sentiment data for this period right now due to a tool issue. I can proceed in a few ways:

What I can do now
- Provide a robust framework and plan for the analysis, so once the data tool is fixed I can deliver a detailed, trader-focused report quickly.
- If you approve, switch to alternative data sources you trust (e.g., other social platforms or news) to keep momentum going while we wait for Reddit data to be retrievable.
- Wait for the Reddit data tool to be fixed and then run the full, day-by-day sentiment analysis for 2025-09-13 through 2025-09-19, plus corresponding news events.

Proposed next steps (once data retrieval is working)
- Collect daily sentiment for GOOGL from Reddit for 2025-09-13 to 2025-09-19 (and any subreddits relevant to equities, tech, and Alphabet-specific communities).
- Normalize sentiment into a daily net sentiment score (positive minus negative, scaled) and derive a 7-day trend.
- Map sentiment shifts to the week’s major Alphabet-related news and AI/Cloud/AdTech dynamics.
- Analyze correlations and lead-lag relationships between sentiment moves and intraday/close price moves, volatility (e.g., ATR, IV), and notable option activity if available.
- Break down drivers by category (AI/news catalysts, regulatory risk, earnings expectations, product announcements, ad market signals, cloud performance).
- Provide actionable implications for traders:
  - Short-term trading ideas around sentiment spikes or reversals.
  - Medium-term positioning depending on fundamental vs. sentiment narrative.
  - Risk flags (regulatory risk, competitive pressure, antitrust scrutiny, ad-market anomalies).

What I need from you
- Would you like me to retry pulling Reddit data now, or would you prefer I switch to an alternative data source (e.g., non-Reddit social media and mainstream financial news) for the interim?
- If you want me to proceed with alternatives, please specify which sources you want prioritized (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, public news headlines, earnings coverage).

In the meantime, here is a structured report outline and a placeholder table you can fill once the data is available. This ensures a smooth handoff when the data tool is back.

Report outline (to be filled with actual data once available)
- Executive snapshot: Summary of sentiment trend, notable news, and immediate implications for GOOGL.
- Daily sentiment review (Sep 13–19, 2025): Day-by-day sentiment scores, notable peaks/troughs, and corresponding news events.
- News & catalysts: Key headlines, regulatory developments, AI announcements, cloud/advertising market signals, and competitive dynamics.
- Sentiment-to-price analysis: Correlation metrics, lead/lag insights, and observed reaction patterns.
- Risk assessment: What could derail sentiment-driven moves (regulatory actions, macro shifts, AI competition, platform changes).
- Trader implications: Practical takeaways, potential entry/exit zones, and risk controls.
- Appendices: Data sources, methodology, limitations, and future data requests.

If you’d like, I can also proceed with a best-effort interim analysis using non-Reddit sources (summarized sentiment signals and headlines) for the same dates, clearly labeled as provisional until Reddit data is available. Just tell me which path you prefer.
