Thanks for the prompt. I tried to pull Reddit-based sentiment data for PLTR across the requested dates, but the data-fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError for both the batch run and the single-date call. I can’t fetch the Reddit data right now. Here’s how I propose we proceed and what I can deliver in the meantime.

What I can do now
- Provide a thorough, structure-focused analysis framework for the week’s social sentiment and news, tailored for PLTR, with clear trader implications.
- Prepare a ready-to-fill report template and a placeholder table that we can populate as soon as the data source is available again (or if you authorize alternate data sources).
- Outline concrete risks, catalysts, and potential trade considerations based on plausible themes around Palantir’s business (government/commercial mix, AI/data analytics shift, earnings cadence, etc.) without over-relying on data I can’t fetch at the moment.

Immediate plan (when the data tool is back or with an alternate source)
- Retrieve daily sentiment signals from Reddit and other major social channels for PLTR over 2025-09-24 to 2025-09-30.
- Compile notable news and company updates affecting Palantir in that week (contracts, product launches, leadership commentary, regulatory/competitive shifts).
- Synthesize: sentiment trajectory, dominant topics, alignment/misalignment with price action, and any divergence signals.
- Produce a detailed, trader-focused long report with granular insights, actionable implications, and risk flags.
- Append a Makrdown table at the end to organize key points.

Proposed report structure (PLTR, weekly social sentiment and news)
1) Executive snapshot
   - Summary of sentiment for the week, key themes, and immediate implications for trading PLTR.
2) Daily sentiment and themes (2025-09-24 to 2025-09-30)
   - For each date: overall sentiment polarity, top topics (e.g., government contracts, AI capabilities, data privacy concerns), notable posts or threads, and any price/volume context.
3) News and events
   - List of company/news events in the week and their potential market impact (earnings hints, contract wins/losses, product updates, management commentary).
4) Sentiment vs. price action analysis
   - Correlation/leading indicators: did sentiment precede moves, lag, or diverge? Any recurring catalysts.
5) Thematic risk and opportunity assessment
   - Key risk factors (regulatory shifts, competitive pressure, contract churn), and opportunities (AI/PLTR platform adoption, scale in commercial verticals).
6) Trader-focused implications
   - Short-term ideas (scalp, swing), risk controls, and watchpoints (earnings cadence, guidance updates, material news).
7) Data sources and methodology
   - What sources were used, data windows, and any caveats (sampling bias, platform policy changes).
8) Appendix: Key takeaways by date
   - A concise, date-stamped summary for quick reference.
9) Makrdown table
   - A compact table capturing section, key points, data status, and next steps.

Preliminary, placeholder Makrdown table (fill with actual data when available)
| Date (or section) | Key sentiment signal | Dominant themes | Notable news/events | Price/volume context | Trader takeaway | Data status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-09-24 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| 2025-09-25 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| 2025-09-26 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| 2025-09-27 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| 2025-09-28 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| 2025-09-29 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| 2025-09-30 | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| Overall | Cumulative sentiment | Top themes | Weekly news impact | Price/volume synthesis | Holistic takeaway | Data status: pending/verified |

What I need from you
- If you want, I can retry the data fetch as soon as the Reddit data tool is available again. Alternatively, I can proceed with an analysis using other sources (e.g., major news outlets, social platforms beyond Reddit, or a manual sentiment sampling approach) if you authorize it.
- Let me know if you’d prefer I proceed with a qualitative weekly narrative now (without the Reddit-specific data) or wait for the Reddit feed to come back.

Would you like me to:
- Retry fetching Reddit sentiment data for PLTR now, or
- Proceed with an alternative data-sources-based weekly sentiment and news report for PLTR, then plug in Reddit data when it’s available?

Once I have a go-ahead (and/or data access), I’ll deliver the full, trader-focused long report with the detailed narrative, insights, and the finalized Makrmarkdown table.
