I attempted to fetch PLTR data and the requested indicators, but the data layer returned errors (FileNotFoundError) for all the tool calls. Specifically, both the price data fetch and the indicator reports failed to retrieve content. I can retry the data fetch now, run the indicators again, or proceed with a data-backed update as soon as the data source is available. If you’d like, I can try again with a shorter date window or in a sequential manner to isolate the issue.

In the meantime, here is a forward-looking, in-depth framework using 8 complementary indicators (one from each relevant category) that would give a well-rounded view of PLTR’s trend, momentum, volatility, and volume dynamics once data is retrievable. I’ve chosen these because they provide diverse perspectives without excessive redundancy.

Selected indicators (up to 8) and why they’re suitable for PLTR
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm whether PLTR is in a broader uptrend or downtrend. Useful for strategic alignment and filtering entries in a stock that can see multi-quarter cycles.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Balances the long-term view with medium-term momentum. Useful for identifying intermediate trend direction and potential pullbacks to a moving average.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum, responsive to quick shifts. Helps identify early entries or exits in a choppy or fast-moving environment when used with longer-term averages for filtering.
- macd: Momentum gauge via differences between EMAs; crossovers around the zero line indicate trend changes. Good for confirming trend shifts in conjunction with price action.
- macds: MACD signal line smoothing; crossovers with MACD offer signals that are less noisy than pure MACD crossovers, acting as a reliability filter.
- macdh: MACD histogram; shows momentum strength and can reveal divergences earlier than price moves. Useful to anticipate potential reversals or continuation with other signals.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Helps spot momentum fatigue, especially when combined with trend direction from the moving averages.
- vwma: Volume-weighted moving average; confirms price action when volume is meaningful. Helps distinguish genuine breaks from price moves driven by low-volume noise and can validate breakout or breakdown signals when price interacts with volume-confirmed levels.

How to interpret these indicators in PLTR’s context (scenario-based guidance)
- Bullish alignment (example pattern to look for once data is available):
  - Price above or crossing above the close_200_sma, with close_50_sma above or rising toward close_200_sma.
  - close_10_ema above the longer-term averages, and MACD line above the MACD signal with positive histogram.
  - RSI trending upwards but not overbought (e.g., in the 40–70 range), with RSI not showing strong divergence against price.
  - VWMA confirms price action with volume-supported moves (price moves on heavier volume).
  - Potential entry points: short pullbacks toward the 50-SMA or VWMA confluence after a bullish MACD/MACDS/histogram setup; use tight ATR-based stops.
- Bearish alignment (what to watch for as a warning or entry for shorts/defensive stance):
  - Price trading below the 200-SMA with 50-SMA crossing below or failing to reclaim above the 200-SMA.
  - MACD crossing down, MACD histogram turning negative, RSI failing to make new highs or showing bearish divergence.
  - VWMA showing weaker volume on rallies, suggesting lack of participation.
  - RSI dipping toward oversold territory (near 30) with negative momentum confirmed by price below VWMA and potential close_10_ema cross below longer-term averages.
- Range/trading-chop considerations:
  - If price meanders around the 50-SMA with MACD histogram flattening and RSI oscillating, rely on VWMA for volume-confirmed breakouts; avoid premature entries in low-volatility regimes.
  - When volatility (e.g., ATR) expands, expect wider price swings around the 50/200 SMAs; use ATR-informed stops in conjunction with the indicators above.

What to do next (practical steps)
- I will re-run data fetch and indicator calculations as soon as the data source is accessible. Once I have the actual values, I’ll deliver:
  - A precise, data-backed trend/momentum/volume assessment for PLTR.
  - Clear trading signals or risk management guidance based on the combined indicator readings.
  - A concise, trader-friendly narrative highlighting key confirmations or warnings.
- If you’d like, I can retry with a smaller date window (e.g., last 90–180 days) to quickly generate the first set of data-backed insights and then expand to the full range.

Appendix: Key points at a glance (structure you can reuse)
- Trend confirmation: 200_SMA and 50_SMA
- Momentum signals: MACD, MACD_Signal, MACD_Histogram, RSI
- Volume confirmation: VWMA
- Short-term momentum: 10_EMA
- Signals to watch for crossovers, divergences, and price interaction with SMAs and VWMA

Markdown table: overview of indicators and their interpretive role
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | Primary interpretation when aligned with price | Trade implication (use case) |
|-----------|----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price above: bullish long-term trend; price below: bearish | Use as macro-trend filter; favor longs above the 200_SMA, shorts below |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend; intermediate support/resistance | Price above/beyond rising 50_SMA supports uptrend; crossing below indicates potential pullback | Use for entries near pullbacks to 50_SMA in uptrends; risk-managed entries |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; crosses with longer averages hint at momentum changes | Entry/exit timing in conjunction with longer-term trend |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMA differences | Positive slope and rising MACD line signals bullish momentum; negative indicates bearish momentum | Confirm with price action and other signals before trading |
| macds | MACD Signal | EMA smoothing of MACD line | MACD crossing above/below its signal line adds confirmation | Use crossovers as trigger signals in trend context |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength; divergence cues | Expanding histogram supports momentum; contracting or negative histogram hints at fading momentum | Divergences can warn of reversals; use with price patterns |
| rsi | Momentum | Relative strength; overbought/oversold | RSI >70 overbought; <30 oversold; watch for divergences | In uptrends, avoid premature shorts; in downtrends, look for rallies as fade opportunities |
| vwma | Volume | Price action adjusted for volume | Price movement with supporting volume (or lack thereof) strengthens conviction of the move | Use with price breakouts/breakdowns to filter false signals |

Next steps
- I’ll re-run the data fetch and indicator calculations as soon as the data source issue is resolved. If you want, I can also try a narrower date range (e.g., last 6–12 months) first to get a quick, data-backed snapshot and then expand to 12–24 months.

Please let me know if you’d like me to retry immediately, or if you prefer I proceed with a different date window or alternative data source.
