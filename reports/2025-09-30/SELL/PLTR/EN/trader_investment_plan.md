Based on the provided investment plan for PLTR and aligning with its bear thesis, my next trading decision is to SELL Palantir (PLTR), with a plan to trim and implement risk controls if you currently hold the position.

Why I’m choosing SELL
- Valuation risk: The stock carries a premium multiple without a proven, sustained path to gross-margin expansion and free cash flow, making upside more dependent on optimistic assumptions.
- Revenue quality risk: Government revenue is volatile and project-based; commercial upsell and international growth need to prove durability rather than assumption.
- Margin and cash flow risk: Heavier services mix in deployments keeps gross margins under pressure unless there is a durable, multi-quarter margin improvement and FCF generation.
- AI monetization & execution risk: Real, durable monetization of AI and Foundry-based workflows remains uncertain in terms of cash flow and margins.
- External risks: Regulatory/data regime dynamics and competition could constrain pricing and pace of expansion.

Action plan if you currently hold PLTR
- Trim exposure: Reduce position by 40-60% today to de-risk from a high-valuation, high-uncertainty name.
- Reallocate proceeds: Move into diversified, lower-volatility software/AI names with clearer margin/upside trajectories or into cash equivalents.
- Hedging: Implement a protective strategy (e.g., protective puts or vertical put spreads) and use a trailing stop on the remaining position to limit drawdown around catalysts.
- Core stance: If you want residual exposure, maintain a smaller, risk-managed core and avoid adding new substantial exposure until clearer profitability momentum is proven.

What to watch for re-entry or further action
- Data triggers: Signs of durable gross-margin improvement, consistent ARR acceleration, and positive free cash flow.
- Price/action triggers: Breaks above key moving averages with momentum (e.g., price above 200-day and 50-day with MACD turning positive) and credible contract wins/ARR progression.
- Catalyst clarity: Earnings updates showing sustained ARR growth by Gov and Commercial, better margin trajectory, and concrete AI monetization milestones.

If you don’t hold PLTR
- Do not initiate a large new position now. Consider a very small starter only if a credible catalyst emerges and price action confirms a trend reversal; otherwise, wait for clearer profitability momentum and margin expansion before allocating capital.

Learning from past mistakes
- Rely on data-driven signals and concrete profitability milestones rather than hype.
- Favor risk management and hedging around catalysts to avoid headline-driven drawdowns.
- Use tiered exposure and re-evaluate with specific triggers tied to margins and cash flow.

Bottom line
- The bear thesis and the lack of durable profitability momentum justify a defensive stance today. I recommend selling or, at minimum, trimming aggressively and hedging while awaiting clearer evidence of sustainable margin expansion and free cash flow.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
