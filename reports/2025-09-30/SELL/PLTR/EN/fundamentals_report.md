I attempted to fetch PLTR data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow) but the data retrieval tools returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like an environment/config issue with the data services rather than a PLTR data problem. I can try again, or we can proceed with an alternative approach.

Options to proceed:
- Option A: Retry data retrieval now (I’ll attempt the parallel calls again and then present the full report once data is returned).
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals overview of Palantir (PLTR) using publicly available information up to today, without the latest 15-day insider data or the newest quarterly numbers.
- Option C: Use an alternative data source you specify (if you have another data feed or API credentials).

If you’d like me to retry, say “Retry now.” If you’d prefer a qualitative overview for now, I’ll draft a detailed fundamentals report structure and insights (without the latest precise numbers) and include a placeholder Markdown table you can fill with numbers when the data becomes available.

What would you like? Also, if you have any preferred date window or specific aspects to emphasize (e.g., profitability trends, liquidity, debt levels, cash flow generation, or insider activity signals), tell me and I’ll tailor the approach.
