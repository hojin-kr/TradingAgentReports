Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch Reddit-based stock news for SPY on 2025-09-30, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal data source issue). It looks like there’s a temporary problem with the data fetch, not with your prompt.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again immediately.
- Proceed without Reddit data: I can deliver a comprehensive SPY sentiment/news analysis using other publicly available sources and clearly label any gaps due to Reddit data being unavailable.
- Wait for a bit and retry: I can pause and retry after a short interval.

If you’d like me to proceed right now without Reddit data, here’s a proposed structure for the long-form report I will deliver (with a detailed, trader-focused angle). I’ll populate it as soon as I can pull data (or mark gaps explicitly if Reddit data is still unavailable):

- Executive snapshot
  - Quick read on SPY positioning, notable macro risk factors, and current sentiment tilt (positive/negative/neutral) from available sources.

- Data sources and methodology
  - Social sentiment: Reddit (if available), plus other sources (e.g., macro news wires, ETF commentaries, market forums).
  - News: latest headlines from official sources, fund commentary, macro catalysts.
  - Sentiment treatment: day-by-day sentiment arrows, intensity scoring, and notable outliers.

- Past week social sentiment synthesis (high level)
  - Daily sentiment trend: dominant tone by day (positive/negative/neutral) with brief rationale.
  - Top topics driving sentiment (e.g., macro headlines, earnings-ish proxy news for broad markets, policy signals).

- Key news catalysts (last 7 days)
  - Summaries of policy moves, economic data, geopolitical events, and any SPY-relevant ETF flows or sector rotation signals.

- Market context and macro drivers
  - Interest rates, inflation trajectory, equity risk appetite, sector leadership (tech/AI, financials, energy), and liquidity/stability cues.

- Implications for SPY and trading opportunities
  - Short-term (1-7 days): tactical bias, levels to watch, and option/strike ideas if applicable.
  - Medium-term (2-8 weeks): trend balance, potential catalysts, and hedging considerations.
  - Flows and technicals: ETFs’ premium/discount, volume spikes, VWAP/ashift, and swing trade setups.

- Risk factors and caveats
  - Data gaps (notably Reddit sentiment if unavailable), model limitations, and external shocks.

- Actionable takeaways for traders
  - If sentiment is skewed positive: likely upside risk into key resistance, prefer calls/long exposure with defined risk.
  - If sentiment is skewed negative: consider hedges, puts, or lower-duration exposures; watch for reversal signals.
  - If mixed: wait for a breakout or clear trigger; define tight risk controls.

- Appendix
  - Data sources, date stamps, and any caveats about data quality.

- Markdown table (key points)
  - I’ll attach a clean, reader-friendly table at the end with: sentiment direction, main catalysts, implied momentum, and recommended actions.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now.
2) Proceed with the above approach using only non-Reddit sources (I’ll start right away).
3) Wait a bit and retry automatically in a short while.

Once you pick, I’ll generate the full report and include a Markdown table of key points at the end.
