I attempted to fetch TSLA data (2024-01-01 to 2025-09-30) but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError in this environment. It looks like the CSV/data source isn’t accessible right now. I can retry fetching data, or proceed with a plan using the indicators I’d select once data is available. How would you like to proceed?

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for TSLA given its typical high-volatility, tech-stock dynamics. The selection avoids redundancy (e.g., not all MACD components) and aims to cover trend, momentum, volume, and volatility.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma (Moving Average)
  Why: Medium-term trend direction; helps identify the prevailing trend and dynamic support/resistance. Use for trend confirmation alongside faster signals.
- close_200_sma (Moving Average)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm overall market regime (bullish/bearish) and potential golden/death cross contexts when combined with 50-SMA.
- close_10_ema (Moving Average)
  Why: Responsive short-term momentum; captures quick shifts and potential entry points. Use to time entries with a longer-term filter.
- macd (MACD)
  Why: Core momentum measure; crossovers signal potential trend changes. Works well when used with trend filters (MAs) in TSLA’s environment.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: Smoothing of MACD line; MACD/macd-signal crossovers help confirm momentum shifts and reduce false signals when used with other indicators.
- rsi (RSI)
  Why: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions; watch for divergences and extreme readings in the context of trend.
- vwma (VWMA)
  Why: Volume-confirmed price action; helps validate moves with volume, which is important for TSLA where price spikes can be volume-driven.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  Why: Dynamic volatility benchmark; aligns price action with a 20-period SMA and helps identify breakouts or reversals when used with bands (upper/lower bands) for confirmation.

Rationale for TSLA context
- TSLA often exhibits pronounced moves with periods of trending behavior punctuated by sharp pullbacks. The combination of 50/200 SMA and 10 EMA provides a robust framework to gauge regime shifts and catch earlier momentum shifts.
- MACD and MACD Signal help detect momentum changes that may precede larger price moves, especially when price breaks above/below key moving averages.
- RSI offers a view on momentum extremes and potential reversals, particularly useful when TSLA has extended moves in one direction.
- VWMA introduces a volume-confirmation layer, which can help filter out false breakouts or fade signals during low-volume periods.
- Bollinger Middle line gives a baseline to gauge price relative to a standard deviation-based envelope, aiding breakout/reversal assessment in a volatile stock like TSLA.

Next steps
- If you’d like me to proceed with generation of concrete indicator signals and a trend report, I can retry pulling TSLA data now (or with a narrower date window you prefer) and then generate a detailed indicators report.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with a qualitative, rules-based interpretation framework using the above indicators, clearly outlining how a trader might act in common TSLA scenarios (without live numbers).

Markdown table: key points

| Indicator | Category | How it helps TSLA analysis | Practical use in strategy |
|---------|----------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Confirm trend with other signals; use as baseline for entries/exits |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend context; regime confirmation | Watch for crossovers with 50-SMA; set strategic bias (bullish/bearish) |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Quick momentum shifts; responsive signal | Use for early entry/exit cues; filter with longer MA to reduce noise |
| macd | MACD | Momentum changes; trend change signals | Look for MACD line crosses over MACD signal; validate with price action |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smooths momentum; helps confirm MACD moves | Use MACD vs MACD Signal crossovers to trigger signals |
| rsi | RSI | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold cues | Watch for divergences and extreme readings in context of trend |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Volume-confirmed price movement | Validate breakouts/fades with volume support; avoid low-volume traps |
| boll | Bollinger Middle | Baseline volatility context; center line dynamics | Use with bands for breakout/reversal signals; assess price interaction with middle line |

Would you like me to retry fetching TSLA data now, or would you prefer I proceed with a qualitative, rules-based interpretation using these indicators without live data? If you want me to retry, please confirm the date range (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-30 or a shorter window) and I’ll run the data fetch again.
