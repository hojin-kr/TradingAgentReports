Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch TSLA Reddit stock news for 2025-09-30, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue with the data source). That means I can’t pull the Reddit-based sentiment dataset right now.

What I can do next (options):
- Option A: Retry fetching TSLA Reddit data now and report back with the latest results as soon as it succeeds.
- Option B: Proceed with the rest of the long-form analysis using the other signals I can access (news headlines, public sentiment on other social channels) once the Reddit feed is unavailable, or once the tool issue is resolved.
- Option C: Pause and wait for the tool to come back online, then run the full, week-long sentiment + news analysis and deliver the comprehensive report with the Markdown table at the end.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option A immediately and attempt another fetch right away. If it fails again, I can switch to Option B and start compiling a detailed TSLA sentiment and news report using whatever sources are currently accessible. How would you like to proceed?
