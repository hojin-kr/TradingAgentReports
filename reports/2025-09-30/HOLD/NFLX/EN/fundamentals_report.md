I attempted to fetch the latest fundamentals for NFLX (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, insider sentiment, and insider transactions) but all tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the numeric data to present a data-driven report yet.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval now (I’ll run the same set of tools again as soon as the backend supports it).
- If you prefer, I can provide a qualitative, non-numeric synthesis based on the typical drivers around NFLX (business model, competitive landscape, profitability trends, and macro risks) while we wait for the data to come through.
- Or, I can proceed once the data tools are available and deliver a full, fed-through report with a concluding Markdown table of key points.

Proposed structure of the full fundamental report (to be filled with actual figures once data is retrieved)
- Executive snapshot
  - Ticker, sector, business model, latest quarterly/annual cadence
  - One-paragraph view of current fundamental stance (growth vs. profitability vs. balance sheet health)
- Company profile
  - Core products (subscription tiers, ads), geographic mix, content strategy, competitive moat
- Balance sheet (latest quarterly report)
  - Key items: cash and equivalents, total assets, total liabilities, debt levels, working capital, liquidity ratios
  - Leverage and solvency indicators (debt/EBITDA, interest coverage)
- Income statement (latest quarterly report)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS, margins by period
  - Revenue mix drivers (subscriber growth, ARPU, pricing actions, ads revenue)
- Cash flow statement (latest quarterly report)
  - Operating cash flow, investing cash flow, financing cash flow
  - Free cash flow trajectory and capex/sourcing needs
- Fundamentals overview
  - Profitability metrics (gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROA/ROE)
  - Efficiency metrics (asset turnover, operating efficiency)
  - Liquidity and working capital management
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Sentiment snapshot and notable insider trades
  - Implications for near-term sentiment
- Trend analysis and risk factors
  - Growth trajectory vs. content costs and capital intensity
  - Competitive dynamics (streaming, ad-supported tier, bundling)
  - Macro and regulatory considerations
- Trader-oriented implications
  - What the latest numbers imply for revenue growth, profitability, and FCF
  - Key catalysts or risks in the next 1–3 quarters
- Appendix: Key metrics and a clean table of highlights

Markdown table (to be populated with actual numbers)
- This table will summarize the most relevant points for quick reference (columns: Metric, Latest Quarter, YoY Change, Key Insight, Risk/Notes)

Example skeleton (will be filled with real data)
- Metric | Latest Quarter | YoY Change | Key Insight | Risks
- Revenue |  |  |  | 
- Operating Margin |  |  |  | 
- Net Income |  |  |  | 
- FCF |  |  |  | 
- Cash & Equivalents |  |  |  | 
- Total Debt |  |  |  | 
- Subscriber Growth (net adds) |  |  |  | 
- Insider Sentiment (past 15d) |  |  |  | 
- Insider Transactions (past 15d) |  |  |  | 

Next steps
- Please confirm how you’d like to proceed:
  1) I retry data retrieval now and deliver the full data-backed report as soon as the tools succeed, with the Markdown table populated.
  2) You’d prefer a qualitative, non-numeric analysis in the meantime (no numbers, just insights and implications).
  3) You want a hybrid: a qualitative analysis now plus a data-backed update as soon as the data tools are available.

If you’d like me to proceed with option 1 or 2, just say the word. I’ll keep you updated and adapt the report once the data tools respond.
