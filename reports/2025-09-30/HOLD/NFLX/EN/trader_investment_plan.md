Recommendation: Hold

Rationale
- The provided plan presents a credible long-term growth path via ads monetization and international expansion, but it also flags meaningful near-term margin pressure and valuation sensitivity. A Hold is prudent to avoid overpaying for a premium multiple before durable monetization and margin improvements materialize.
- Near-term catalysts are mixed: potential ad ARPU uplift and international growth on the upside, but content spend intensity and ROI on new titles, plus regulatory/regulatory exposure, capex discipline, and potential margin compression keep upside conditional.
- Upgrade to Buy only after durable, multi-quarter evidence that ad-driven ARPU is lifting margins and FCF, with guidance reaffirmed or raised.

Triggers to upgrade from Hold toward Buy
- Ads-driven ARPU uplift: sustained sequential ARPU growth in the ads tier of at least 6–8% year-over-year for two consecutive quarters.
- International monetization momentum: accelerating international net subs and improving or stabilizing international contribution margins.
- Margin/FCF improvement: operating margin stabilizes or expands, and free cash flow turns positive or accelerates meaningfully; capex as a share of revenue declines with tangible ROI on new productions.
- Guide alignment: management reinforces or raises margin, FCF, and ad-revenue contribution guidance over next 4–6 quarters.

Key quarterly metrics to monitor
- Sub growth by region, particularly international
- ARPU by tier and overall ARPU trajectory
- Ad revenue growth and regional CPM resilience
- Content ROI metrics and production-cost trends
- Operating margin, EBITDA margin, and free cash flow
- Capex intensity and ROI on new facilities or productions

Entry/exit plan (price and signal-driven)
- If price action demonstrates a durable uptrend (e.g., price remains above major moving averages with constructive momentum and volume), gradually tilt toward Buy weight.
- If quarterly results miss on subs or ARPU or if EBITDA/margin deteriorates with higher capex drag, trim exposure or tighten stops.
- If adverse catalysts emerge (regulatory shocks, punitive tariffs, or sustained negative ROI signals), shift to a defensive stance promptly.

Risk controls and hedging
- Consider a conservative exposure cap (2–3% of risk budget) with staged increases only on confirmed catalysts.
- Hedge around catalysts (protective puts or collars) to mitigate sharp near-term downside around earnings or regulatory headlines.

Operational cadence and learning
- Quarterly review against a pre-defined checklist of the six signal areas above.
- Prepare scenario analyses (base/bull/bear) with probability-weighted expectations to guide capital allocation.
- Document learnings after each earnings cycle to refine triggers and avoid overreliance on any single metric.

Contingency note
- If durable signs of monetization and margin improvement never materialize, be prepared to reduce exposure or exit to protect capital.

Final decision
- Hold now, with a disciplined plan to upgrade to Buy only on clear, durable progress in ads ARPU, international monetization, and margin/FCF strength, supported by reaffirmed or improved guidance.
