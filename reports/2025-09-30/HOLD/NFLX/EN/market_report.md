Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch NFLX data to compute the indicators, but the environment returned a FileNotFoundError for NFLX Yahoo data. I can’t generate the data-driven indicator values right now. If you can re-enable data access or provide the latest price/history data, I’ll produce the full, data-backed analysis immediately. In the meantime, here’s a robust indicator framework tailored for NFLX and how to interpret it in typical market conditions. I’ve selected a diverse set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights without redundancy.

Selected indicators (8) and rationale
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average
  - Why: Medium-term trend; acts as dynamic support/resistance
  - How to use: Look for price staying above/below the 50 SMA; crossovers with price can signal momentum shifts, but confirm with other indicators due to lag.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming overall market regime
  - How to use: Golden cross (price crosses above 200 SMA or 50/200 SMA cross) suggests bullish longer-term trend; death cross suggests bearish longer-term trend. Use with momentum indicators for timing.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average
  - Why: Responsive short-term momentum indicator
  - How to use: Watch for quick shifts; a price/close above 10 EMA can indicate short-term bullish momentum, while a cross below can indicate a short-term pullback. Use in conjunction with longer-term averages to filter noise.
- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs
  - Why: Core momentum signal; helps identify trend changes
  - How to use: Cross of MACD line above/below zero and cross with MACD Signal; look for divergences with price as a potential early warning of trend changes.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD)
  - Why: Smoothing of MACD; cross with MACD line generates entry/exit signals
  - How to use: MACD crossing MACD Signal is a tradable signal when aligned with price trend and other filters
- rsi (Momentum)
  - What it measures: Relative strength index (momentum)
  - Why: Overbought/oversold conditions and momentum strength
  - How to use: Watch for overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) readings and potential reversals; beware during strong trends where RSI can stay extended. Look for divergences with price and confirmation from trend indicators.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - What it measures: 20-period SMA used as the middle line for Bollinger Bands
  - Why: Baseline for price volatility and dynamic near-term ranges
  - How to use: Price interacting with upper/lower bands signals potential breakouts or reversals; band width changes indicate volatility expansion/contraction. Use with RSI and MACD for confirmation.
- atr (ATR)
  - What it measures: Average True Range (volatility)
  - Why: Volatility-based risk management and position sizing
  - How to use: Use to set dynamic stops and to gauge current volatility regime; rising ATR suggests wider stops and potentially larger price moves; falling ATR suggests tighter risk controls.

How I would interpret these together (framework you can apply once data is available)
- Trend confirmation: If price remains above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, and MACD is positive with a rising histogram, the path of least resistance is bullish. A death cross (price below 50/200) or MACD turning negative would suggest a bearish regime.
- Momentum and timing: A bullish crossover in MACD/macd with RSI above 50 and price above the 10 EMA can signal a higher-probability entry, especially if price also rides the upper Bollinger Band or expands above the middle Bollinger Band with rising ATR.
- Reversal risk: RSI diverging from price (e.g., price making new highs while RSI fails to) can warn of a potential pullback; confirm with MACD/price action near key moving averages.
- Volatility context: ATR rising while price tests upper Bollinger Band could indicate a breakaway move with higher risk (consider wider stops); ATR contracting with price consolidating near the 20 SMA can indicate a pause before a breakout or a continuation is more probable.
- Risk management: Use ATR to set stop distances (e.g., 1.0–1.5 ATRs from entry) and adjust position sizes as volatility changes.

What to monitor if you run the analysis now or in the future
- Price vs. 50 SMA and 200 SMA for trend context
- MACD vs MACD Signal and MACD histogram for momentum shifts
- RSI level and any divergences with price
- Price interactions with Bollinger Bands and band width changes for breakout/reversal signals
- ATR-driven stop levels and position sizing adjustments

Appendix: quick reference table (indicators and usage)
| Indicator | Category | What it measures / purpose | How to interpret for NFLX (generic) | Trade cue when aligned with other signals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above suggests uptrend; price below suggests downtrend | Signal strength increases when combined with price above/below 200 SMA and MACD trend |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above indicates bullish longer-term regime; below indicates bearish | Look for golden/death cross with other trend signals for stronger conviction |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts in momentum; helpful for timing | When crossing above 50 SMA and MACD bullish, strengthens entry signal |
| macd | MACD | Momentum / trend changes | Positive MACD and rising histogram signals bullish momentum | Crossovers with MACD Signal plus price action near key MA levels strengthen entries |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD, trigger | MACD crossing MACD Signal can signal entries/exits | Use with MACD line direction and RSI for confirmation |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum strength, overbought/oversold | >70 overbought risk, <30 oversold risk; watch for divergences | Confluence with price action around MA levels increases signal reliability |
| boll | Volatility | Volatility baseline (middle Bollinger Band) | Price interactions with bands indicate breakouts/reversals | Breakouts above upper band with expanding ATR can signal stronger moves |
| atr | Volatility | Volatility magnitude and risk management | Higher ATR means wider stops; lower ATR means tighter risk | Use to size positions and set stop levels in line with volatility regime |

Next steps
- If you can provide the latest NFLX price/history data or re-enable data access for the tool, I’ll run the four categories of indicators (8 in total as listed) and deliver:
  - A detailed, data-backed trend report with exact readings
  - Specific buy/hold/sell recommendations (if you want a final transaction proposal, I can present it based on the data)
  - A concise, result-focused markdown table summarizing the key signals and actionable ideas

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or would you prefer that I proceed with this indicator framework once you supply the data? If you want a hypothetical scenario (no data), I can generate example signal interpretations for NFLX to illustrate how a trader might act in different regimes.
