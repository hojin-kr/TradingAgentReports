I attempted to fetch NFLX Reddit stock/news data for 2025-09-30, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool issue). It looks like a data retrieval problem on the Reddit feed side rather than a data gap for NFLX.

Here are two options I can proceed with right away:

Option A — Retry Reddit data now
- I can retry the Reddit data fetch for NFLX on 2025-09-30 and then compile the full report with Reddit sentiment, plus other sources if Reddit data comes back clean.

Option B — Proceed with multi-source sentiment and news (no Reddit)
- I can generate a comprehensive long report using:
  - Public social sentiment from non-Reddit sources (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits, other discussion boards)
  - Major news coverage (recent company news, earnings, content slate, partnerships, regulatory/licensing updates)
  - Any available sentiment trends by day over the past week
  - Key macro factors and potential catalysts for NFLX
- I will clearly note any data gaps (e.g., Reddit data unavailable) and provide implications for traders.

What would you like me to do? If you want the full analysis now, I’ll proceed with Option B and clearly flag Reddit data as unavailable. If you prefer, I can retry Option A first and integrate Reddit as soon as the tool responds. 

Additionally, here’s the structure I’ll follow for the full report (and I’ll append a Markdown table at the end as requested):

- Executive summary: overall sentiment tone and key near-term catalysts
- Daily sentiment breakdown (last 7 days): highs, lows, notable spikes, potential drivers
- Thematically organized sentiment analysis: content themes (content slate, pricing, competition, user engagement, ad-tier strategy, international expansion)
- News synthesis: recent company announcements, earnings context, regulatory or policy signals, competitor actions
- Implications for traders:
  - Short-term catalysts and risks
  - Potential price/volatility drivers
  - Areas to monitor (earnings cadence, subscriber metrics, ARPU, churn, content costs)
- Key takeaways and potential trades (hypothetical scenarios with risk considerations)
- Appendix: data sources and methodology
- Markdown table: concise key points and indicators for quick reference

Tell me which path you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
