Decision: Hold NVDA

Rationale aligned with the proposed plan:
- The bull thesis for NVDA remains intact over the multi-year AI infrastructure cycle, supported by durable growth in AI data-center deployments, software moat (CUDA ecosystem), and improving cash flow dynamics.
- Near-term headwinds are meaningful: regulatory/geopolitical risks, potential multiple compression, and valuation sensitivity amid rate/regulatory shifts. These factors justify patience rather than chasing new highs.

What this means for action now:
- If you already own NVDA:
  - Hold the core position but reduce incremental risk into strength. Consider trimming into rallies around 184–190 with the plan to rebuild on a confirmable pullback.
  - Implement protection to cap downside while preserving upside optionality:
    - Hedge: buy near-term puts around 170 (or employ a modest put spread such as long 170 put, short 150 put) to limit premium cost.
  - Maintain disciplined risk controls: ATR-based trailing stops, with tighter stops if price breaks below key supports or below major moving averages (e.g., a breach below 170 on high volume could trigger reassessment).
- If you do not own NVDA:
  - Do not chase at current levels. Wait for clearer triggers:
    - Bullish entry: break above 184–190 with convincing volume and momentum (MACD positive, RSI improving, price above 50SMA/200SMA).
    - Defensive entry on a pullback: around 170–172 with bullish signals (volume pickup, price stabilizing above 50SMA, MACD positive cross).
  - Use a defined-risk approach: a small starter position on a pullback with tight stop (e.g., 165–168) and a plan to add on confirmation; or consider limited-risk call spreads near a near-term breakout zone.

Data/research signals to monitor (before and after earnings):
- Bookings/capex cadence by region (especially Europe and other non-US data centers).
- Margin trajectory and cash flow stability (FCF growth).
- Regulatory headlines and policy shifts (export controls, antitrust activity, regional restrictions).
- Price-action filters: trend vs. 50SMA/200SMA, MACD, RSI momentum, ATR-derived volatility.

Operational notes:
- Keep total risk modest (e.g., 1–2% of portfolio per NVDA trade).
- Reassess after the next earnings cycle and any mid-cycle regional updates; adjust stance if bookings/margins deviate meaningfully from plan.

Next steps:
- I can generate a data-backed trend update and concrete entry/exit levels the moment signals land, or keep refining the Hold plan with numerical triggers as new data arrives.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
