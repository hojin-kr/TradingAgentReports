I tried to fetch the Reddit sentiment data for NVDA for 2025-09-24 to 2025-09-30, but the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError across all dates. I can’t pull the day-by-day social sentiment data right now due to that tool issue.

Here’s how I can proceed and what you’ll get once the data fetch works (or if you prefer, I can proceed with a framework now and fill in data later):

What I can do next (options)
- Retry fetching the Reddit sentiment data now to build the week-long sentiment profile.
- If the tool remains unavailable, switch to an alternate data source we can access (summary headlines, official company news, and general public sentiment signals) and still produce a robust report with clear caveats.
- Proceed with a comprehensive framework and methodology, and deliver the analyzed structure plus placeholders you can later replace with actual sentiment numbers once data retrieval succeeds.

What the full long report will include (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot
  - High-level sentiment trend for NVDA over the past week
  - Key drivers behind sentiment shifts (e.g., earnings signals, AI demand, supply chain chatter, geopolitical/regulatory news)
- Daily sentiment analysis
  - For each day (Sep 24–30, 2025): sentiment score, volume, top themes, and notable Reddit posts
  - Correlation with NVDA price action and volume on the same days
- Top themes by day
  - Recurring themes (AI demand, data-center capex, margins, competition, regulatory/export controls, chip supply, guidance)
  - Any red flags (e.g., sentiment fatigue, overhang from valuation stretched thinking, AI hype vs. fundamentals)
- Company news and catalyst review (past week)
  - Summarize official NVDA news releases, earnings-related commentary, product announcements, partnerships
  - Regulatory or macro news impacting sentiment (export controls, antitrust considerations, industry-wide AI demand trends)
- Sentiment vs. fundamentals
  - How sentiment aligns or diverges from key fundamentals (AI market opportunity, data-center growth, gross margins, capex cycles)
  - Implied volatility context and option-market implications if relevant
- Risk factors and scenario analysis
  - Bull/Tail risk scenarios (e.g., AI demand keeps accelerating, supply constraints ease, regulatory headwinds)
  - Bear/ downside scenarios (demand normalization, competition gains, macro slowdown)
- Trading implications
  - Short-term tactical signals (entries/exits around catalysts, risk management)
  - Longer-term considerations (positioning around AI battery-of-niched-systems demand, hyperscaler capex cycles)
- Key takeaways for traders
  - What to watch in the next 1–2 weeks
  - Which narrative themes are most likely to drive price action

Proposed end format
- A detailed narrative report plus a Markdown table at the end that organizes the key points for quick review.

Proposed Markdown table (template; fill with actual data once available)
- This table is designed to summarize the week succinctly and is ready to be populated with the actual daily sentiment data.

Markdown table template (to be filled with data)
- Date | Daily Sentiment % | Sentiment Trend (Up/Down/Flat) | Daily Volume (relative) | Top Themes | Notable Posts/Quotes | NVDA Price Move | Related News Headlines
- 2025-09-24 | | | | | | | 
- 2025-09-25 | | | | | | | 
- 2025-09-26 | | | | | | | 
- 2025-09-27 | | | | | | | 
- 2025-09-28 | | | | | | | 
- 2025-09-29 | | | | | | | 
- 2025-09-30 | | | | | | | 

Next steps
- Tell me which path you prefer:
  1) I retry the Reddit data pull now and return with a complete week’s sentiment report plus the markdown table, or
 2) I proceed with the framework and deliver the structured, data-ready methodology and placeholders, then fill in once the data tool is operational, or
 3) I switch to an alternative data source (e.g., summarize official NVDA news and any publicly available sentiment indicators) to provide a timely, actionable weekly view.

If you’d like, I can also start with a high-level NVDA weekly context (aside from Reddit)—covering earnings cadence, AI demand signals, potential catalysts, and current macro/regulatory considerations—to give you immediate context while we resolve the data-fetch issue.
