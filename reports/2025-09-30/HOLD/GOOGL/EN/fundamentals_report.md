I ran into an internal data-access error while trying to fetch the requested data for GOOGL (FileNotFoundError). Specifically, attempts to retrieve insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the latest quarterly balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement failed. I don’t have usable data from the tools at the moment to assemble the full fundamentals report you asked for.

How would you like to proceed?
- Option 1: I retry data retrieval now and, if successful, I’ll deliver the full comprehensive fundamentals report (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement, and a detailed analysis with trader-focused insights and a final summary table).
- Option 2: I proceed with a best-effort qualitative fundamentals overview for Alphabet (GOOGL) based on publicly reported information up to 2024/2025 and common fundamentals (revenue mix, margins, capex, cash flow, balance sheet health, and strategic risks), clearly noting that I’m not pulling the latest insider data.
- Option 3: You provide alternative data sources or a data window (e.g., you have a file or link you want me to use), and I’ll incorporate them into the full report.

If you want a quick interim path, I can prepare:
- A high-level framework of what the report would cover (sections, key metrics to watch, and how to interpret them for traders).
- A placeholder structure with instructions on what to fill in once the data is retrieved.

Please tell me which option you prefer, or share any alternative data access you’d like me to use.
