I attempted to fetch GOOGL price data and the eight indicators in parallel, but the data retrieval failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the data access layer. Specifically, all indicator requests returned the same error, which means I don’t currently have the actual readings to report trends. If you’d like, I can retry the fetch now, or run the calls sequentially to help isolate where the issue is. Please let me know which you prefer.

In the meantime, here is a carefully selected set of up to 8 indicators tailored for a well-rounded, complementary view of GOOGL (Alphabet) as of 2025-09-30. I’ve chosen indicators that provide trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management signals without redundancy.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Rationale and how to use them together
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages, medium-term trend)
  - What it tells you: Direction of the medium-term trend and a dynamic support/resistance level.
  - How to interpret: Price staying above suggests a bullish bias; price below suggests a bearish bias. Use with the 200 SMA to assess overall trend alignment.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages, long-term trend)
  - What it tells you: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death cross scenarios with shorter SMAs).
  - How to interpret: When price is above the 200 SMA and 50 SMA, the bullish regime is stronger; a cross below could indicate a trend change or pullback risk.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages, short-term momentum)
  - What it tells you: Quick shifts in momentum; more responsive than the SMAs.
  - How to interpret: Price crossing above the 10 EMA can signal short-term upside momentum; price crossing below can signal downside momentum. Use as a trigger alongside longer-term trend confirmation to filter false signals in choppy markets.

- macd (MACD line)
  - What it tells you: Overall momentum and trend direction from the difference of two EMAs.
  - How to interpret: MACD line crossing above the signal is a bullish cue; crossing below is bearish. Histogram (macdh) helps gauge strength of momentum and potential divergences.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it tells you: Smoothed momentum signal to confirm MACD cross signals.
  - How to interpret: Crossovers with the MACD line provide more robust entry/exit signals when aligned with price action and other indicators.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it tells you: Momentum strength and potential divergence visually.
  - How to interpret: Growing positive histogram suggests strengthening upside momentum; increasing negative histogram suggests strengthening downside momentum. Useful for divergence checks with price.

- rsi (Momentum, overbought/oversold)
  - What it tells you: Momentum level and potential reversals via overbought/oversold readings.
  - How to interpret: RSI above 70 can indicate overbought conditions in a strong uptrend; RSI below 30 can indicate oversold in a downtrend. In strong trends, RSI can stay extended for long periods, so corroborate with trend indicators.

- atr (Volatility)
  - What it tells you: Market volatility level, which informs risk management (stop placement and position sizing).
  - How to interpret: Rising ATR implies higher volatility and potentially larger stop ranges; falling ATR implies calmer markets. Use ATR to scale risk and to set distance for stops away from entry points.

How to combine these into a practical trading framework (without current readings)
- Trend confirmation layer:
  - Check price relative to 50 SMA and 200 SMA; look for alignment (price above both, or below both).
  - Confirm with MACD direction (MACD above signal for bullish bias, MACD below signal for bearish bias).

- Momentum refinement layer:
  - Use 10 EMA cross signals in conjunction with MACD cross signals to time entries. For example, bullish entry when price is above 50/200 SMAs, MACD is positive and rising, and price crosses above the 10 EMA.

- Momentum health and risk layer:
  - Check RSI to gauge momentum strength and potential reversals; avoid taking long signals when RSI is in overbought territory in an already stretched trend.
  - Use ATR to set dynamic stop-loss distances and adjust position sizing according to current volatility.

- Momentum strength and risk checks:
  - Cross-validate MACD histogram with price action around the 50/200 SMAs; look for divergences between MACD macdh and price as a warning signal.

What you’ll get once data is available
- A detailed trend report that pins down the current regime (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) using the moving averages and MACD.
- Momentum readings and potential reversal signals from RSI and MACD histogram.
- A volatility-based risk management plan using ATR to scale stops and position sizes.
- A concise set of actionable signals (entry/exit/exit-only or no-trade) based on a combination of these indicators, with an emphasis on avoiding false signals in choppy markets.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now or run the calls sequentially to help troubleshoot the failure. Please tell me which you prefer:
  - Retry all indicators now (I’ll report the full trends as soon as data is retrieved).
  - Run the calls sequentially to identify where the issue lies (start with get_YFin_data, then each indicator).
