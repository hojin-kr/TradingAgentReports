Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch META Reddit stock data for 2025-09-30, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data retrieval endpoint is temporarily failing or misconfigured on my side.

Here are options to move forward quickly. Tell me which you prefer, and I’ll proceed immediately:

- Option 1: Retry the Reddit data fetch now
  - I’ll attempt another call to get META Reddit stock info for 2025-09-30 and report back with a full, data-backed sentiment summary once it succeeds or reports a detailed error if it fails again.

- Option 2: Use a fallback approach (no Reddit data)
  - I’ll compile a comprehensive long-form report based on:
    - Public sentiment signals from other social channels (where available)
    - Recent META company news (product announcements, earnings, regulatory issues)
    - Market context for ad-tech and social networks
  - I’ll clearly label any sentiment or signal that is inferred from non-Reddit sources and note the data gaps.

- Option 3: Narrow the data window
  - If you’re flexible, I can pull data for a different date window (e.g., the last 7 days or the last 14 days) to still provide timely insights, in case the current date tool is intermittently failing.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option 2 right away to deliver a thorough, trader-oriented analysis (sentiment trends, news catalysts, and implications) and attach a Markdown table at the end to summarize key points. Just confirm which option you prefer. 

In the meantime, here’s a ready-to-fill structure I’ll use for the final report (and I’ll populate it with data once the fetch succeeds or using the fallback sources):

- Executive summary
  - High-level pulse on META’s sentiment and key near-term catalysts
- Social sentiment snapshot (past week)
  - Reddit (if available), plus other major platforms
  - Net sentiment, strongest positive themes, strongest negative themes
  - Notable shifts day-by-day
- Recent news and catalysts (past week)
  - Product/feature updates, earnings-related news, regulatory/regulatory-privacy developments, partnerships, governance
- Thematic drivers and sentiment analysis
  - AI/ML product momentum, Metaverse/Reality Labs updates, ad-revenue trajectory, competition, user growth metrics
- Risk and uncertainty flags
  - Regulatory risk, advertising market softness, platform policy changes, macro factors
- Implications for traders
  - Short-term trading bias (bullish/bearish), volatility drivers, entry/exit considerations, hedging ideas
- Conclusions and forward-looking view
  - What to watch next week, catalysts, and potential surprises
- Quick reference table (Markdown table)
  - Category | Key signals | Source | Confidence

If you want me to proceed with a specific option now, say the word and I’ll dive in.
