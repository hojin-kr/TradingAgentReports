Apologize for the hiccup: I tried to fetch META data for 2024-09-30 to 2025-09-30, but the data retrieval tool (get_YFin_data) returned a FileNotFoundError. The data service appears unavailable right now. I can retry fetching the data shortly, or, if you prefer, I can provide a rigorous indicator framework and a detailed qualitative analysis plan you can use immediately and fill in once the data is back. How would you like to proceed?

Given the current situation, here is a focused, complementary 8-indicator framework tailored for META (META) and a detailed, nuanced outline of how to interpret the signals once data is available. The indicators emphasize trend confirmation, momentum, and volatility to help navigate a stock like META, which often exhibits episodic volatility around AI/media catalysts and platform monetization updates.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Rationale for these choices
- Trend context: close_50_sma and close_200_sma give a clear view of medium- and long-term trend direction and potential dynamic support/resistance levels. close_10_ema provides a swifter read on near-term momentum that can help with timely entries or exits.
- Momentum signal ensemble: macd, macds, and macdh together capture momentum direction (MACD line), momentum strength (MACD histogram), and momentum timing through MACD signal crossovers. This trio helps filter false signals that can occur in choppy markets.
- Momentum-contrast/read on strength: rsi furnishes a standard momentum gauge, highlighting potential overbought/oversold conditions and possible divergences when price action diverges from RSI.
- Volatility/risk tuning: atr gives a practical read on current volatility for risk management (position sizing, stop placement, and volatility-based targets).

How to interpret these indicators for META (nuanced, scenario-based guidance)
- In a trending up environment:
  - Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA, with the 50SMA above the 200SMA (the classic bullish layout). The 10 EMA should be above or close to price action, indicating sustained near-term momentum.
  - MACD line above MACD signal, with a rising MACD histogram (macd and macdh positive and expanding). Look for pullbacks toward the 50SMA as potential entry areas if the macd/macd_hist show bullish resilience.
  - RSI typically staying in the 50–70 range or rising toward 70, but avoid overextension above 70 for new long entries unless price confirms with a breakout.
  - ATR trending higher confirms rising volatility—use this to adjust stop distances upward and avoid tight stops in a developing uptrend.
- In a range-bound or choppy market:
  - Price oscillates around the 50SMA and 200SMA, sometimes crossing, with the 10 EMA whipsawing.
  - MACD may show crossovers that don’t lead to follow-through, and the MACD histogram can oscillate without a clear directional bias.
  - RSI hover around 40–60; watch for bearish/bullish divergences with price making higher highs but RSI not confirming, or vice versa.
  - ATR likely contracts then expands with news-driven moves; use ATR to adjust risk dynamically and avoid overleverage on low-volatility days.
- Signals to act on (entry/exit ideas, context-driven):
  - Bullish setup:
    - Price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD line crosses above MACD signal, MACD histogram rising, RSI rising away from oversold, and ATR showing a moderate-to-increasing level.
    - Pullback toward the 50SMA or (less often) the 10 EMA with bullish MACD histogram re-acceleration can be a constructive entry point.
  - Caution/partial exit setup:
    - MACD divergence (price makes new highs while MACD histogram fails to, or MACD line loses momentum) in the presence of still-elevated RSI can warn of a pullback.
    - If price fails to sustain above 50SMA/200SMA, or price moves below both SMAs with MACD weakening, consider trimming or awaiting clearer confirmation.
  - Bearish setup (for risk management, not a default short signal on META):
    - Price below both SMAs, MACD below MACD signal with declining histogram, RSI trending toward 30–40, ATR not expanding in a bullish way (i.e., volatility is not backing a potential reversal). This combination can imply risk of trend reversal or deeper pullback.

What to watch on META specifically (adaptable insights)
- META has historically shown sensitivity to AI-related monetization catalysts and ad-market dynamics. Monitor how price responds to macro factors and earnings-related volatility when these indicators align with price action (e.g., bullish crossovers coinciding with price testing above key moving averages).
- Use ATR to calibrate risk around events: Meta often experiences volatile moves around earnings or regulatory/news catalysts; having ATR-informed stops helps prevent premature exits on temporary spikes.
- Use the MACD ensemble to differentiate true momentum shifts from noise: a convincing breakout accompanied by a positive MACD signal and increasing histogram strengthens conviction; lack of corroboration suggests waiting or lighter exposure.

Notes on data and next steps
- I will retry fetching actual historical data for META as soon as the data service is available again and then generate the 8-indicator results for the specified window. Once I have the data, I will produce a detailed, data-backed trend report with signals, potential entry/exit points, and risk controls, tailored to your preferred time horizon.

Markdown table: Key indicators summary and usage for META
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for META | Signals to act on (entry/exit/risk) | Key caveats |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average, medium-term trend | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; use with longer-term trend context | Price above/below 50SMA; potential pullback entry near 50SMA in uptrend | Lags price; confirm with momentum/volatility signals |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average, long-term trend | Overall trend benchmark; confirm trend direction (golden/death cross potential) | Price above 200SMA with 50SMA alignment; or cross of 50SMA over 200SMA | Slower reacting; best for strategic view rather than frequent entries |
| close_10_ema | 10-day exponential moving average, near-term momentum | Captures quick momentum shifts; more sensitive than SMAs | Price above 10EMA with positive MACD momentum; pullbacks to 10EMA as entry in uptrends | Prone to noise in choppy markets; use with longer-term filters |
| macd | MACD line momentum indicator | Momentum direction and magnitude; signals crossovers | MACD above MACD signal with rising histogram for long entries; bearish cross for exits | Best with trend confirmation; avoid isolated signals in low-volatility regimes |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoothing of MACD; crossovers confirm timing | MACD crossing above MACD signal as bullish trigger | Should be part of broader strategy to reduce false positives |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength; divergence cues | Increasing MACD histogram with price action confirms strength; negative/waning histogram warns risk | Can be volatile; combine with price action filters |
| rsi | Relative Strength Index | Momentum magnitude and potential overbought/oversold | RSI overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) signals; watch for divergences | Strong trends can push RSI beyond typical thresholds; use trend filters |
| atr | Average True Range | Market volatility; informs risk management and position sizing | Rising ATR implies higher stop distances; adjust sizing accordingly | Reactive measure; use with price action and risk limits |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and, once it succeeds, generate a full, data-driven narrative with concrete META trend observations for the chosen date range. Please tell me whether to retry immediately or proceed with the qualitative framework above.
