Recommendation: Buy META with a disciplined, risk-managed entry and ongoing monitoring.

Key rationale (aligned with the plan you shared)
- Durable cash flow supports buybacks, selective capex, and AI-related investments, providing a cushion against near-term volatility.
- Multi-channel monetization: AI-enabled targeting, non-advertising rails (UK ad-free tier, creator/ecommerce tools, enterprise tools) diversify revenue and offer optionality.
- Balance sheet resilience reduces downside risk from regulatory or macro shocks, making a longer-horizon bull case more tenable.
- Bear risks are real (ad-market sensitivity, AI payoff timing, Reality Labs ROI, regulatory headwinds), so entry should be staged and hedged.

Concrete entry and risk-management plan
- Positioning: Start with a core 1–2% of portfolio exposure to META as a long-term holding, with the option to tier in additional exposure on favorable technicals and progress on AI monetization rails.
- Entry signals for add点:
  - Constructive pullbacks to test: 50-day moving average zone with price above both 50SMA and 200SMA, bullish MACD, and rising RSI.
  - Add in staggered tranches if the above conditions remain intact and fundamentals show progress (e.g., AI monetization milestones, UK ad-free uptake).
- Stop-loss and risk controls:
  - Use ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR below a recent swing low) rather than a fixed-dollar stop.
  - If using options as a hedge, implement collars or protective puts to cap downside while preserving upside exposure; e.g., pair a protective put with a long stock position, or a collar funded with a modest short-dated call.
- Hedging around catalysts:
  - Around earnings, AI product updates, or regulatory headlines, maintain hedges to weather volatility while staying exposed to potential upside.
  - If volatility spikes and fundamentals don’t deteriorate, consider near-term OTM calls for optionality with a protective put to limit downside.
- Time horizon and review cadence:
  - Reassess every 4–8 weeks. Look for concrete progress on AI monetization (ARPU uplift, UK uptake, creator/ecommerce monetization) and ad-market signals.
  - If bear risks intensify (ad-revenue slowdown, regulatory headwinds, or weak ROI on Reality Labs), consider trimming or tightening hedges.

Operational notes (to improve discipline)
- Use scenario-based planning (bear/base/bull) and adhere to a defined exit framework if catalysts disappoint or if risk signals deteriorate.
- Maintain a hard stop on individual exposure and overall risk limits to prevent “buy and forget” behavior.
- Track the key signals from the plan (AI monetization progress, ARPU trends, regulatory headlines, earnings cadence) and let them drive incremental buying or trimming.

Final thought
- The proposed path is to own META as a long-term position but not to chase. A staged, hedged entry with disciplined risk controls maximizes upside while curbing downside in the face of uncertain near-term catalysts.
