Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AMD Reddit sentiment data for 2025-09-30, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t access Reddit-based sentiment right now due to that tool issue. I can either retry, or proceed with a robust analysis using other available sources and a structured framework until the Reddit data tool is back online.

Here are options to move forward:

- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit fetch again immediately and then run a full cross-source analysis once it succeeds.
- Proceed with alternate sources: I can build a comprehensive AMD analysis focusing on:
  - Public news from the past week (press releases, earnings-related news, product announcements, partnerships, supply chain updates, regulatory filings if any)
  - Sentiment proxies from other social platforms (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, Threads) and general market chatter
  - Market data signals (price action, volume, options activity, volatility, analyst notes)
  - Macro and industry context (semiconductor cycle, AI demand signals, supply/demand shifts)
- Hybrid approach: Try the Reddit fetch for a bit, but supplement with the best-available data from other sources in parallel, so you still get a thorough report today.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, please choose:
1) Retry Reddit data now, or
2) Proceed with the alternate-sources-only approach, or
3) Do a hybrid (retry Reddit in a short window while I assemble the rest of the report now).

What would you prefer? In the meantime, I can share a detailed plan and a markdown table skeleton you can use for the final report.
