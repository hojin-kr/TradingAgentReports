Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AMD data (2023-09-30 to 2025-09-30) to generate the indicators, but the data pull hit a FileNotFoundError on the data source. I can retry the pull, try a shorter window, or proceed with a plan and indicators so we’re ready as soon as the data is available. Here’s a concrete, ready-to-run plan and a recommended 8-indicator setup tailored for AMD’s current market context.

Recommended 8 indicators for AMD (diverse, complementary signals)
1) close_50_sma
- What it tells you: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- How to use: If price is consistently above the 50SMA and the 50SMA is sloping up, consider a bullish tilt; a cross below or a flattening slope can signal a pause or potential pullback.

2) close_200_sma
- What it tells you: Long-term trend baseline; overall market context.
- How to use: Price above the 200SMA generally supports a long-term uptrend; a bearish cross or price dipping below suggests longer-term risk or a trend change.

3) close_10_ema
- What it tells you: Responsive short-term momentum.
- How to use: A cross of price above the 10EMA can flag near-term bullish momentum; a cross below can flag near-term weakness. Be mindful of noise in choppy markets; filter with longer-timeframe signals.

4) macd
- What it tells you: Momentum and trend strength via EMA differences.
- How to use: MACD crossing above zero or crossing above the MACD signal line can signal bullish momentum; crossing below zero or below the signal line can signal bearish momentum. Use with price/short-term signals to avoid false positives.

5) macds
- What it tells you: Smoothing of MACD; helps confirm crossovers.
- How to use: A bullish signal is MACD crossing above macds; a bearish signal is MACD crossing below macds. When macd and macds align with price action, signals are stronger.

6) rsi
- What it tells you: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions.
- How to use: RSI > 70 may indicate overbought conditions (watch for reversals or continued strength in uptrends); RSI < 30 may indicate oversold conditions (watch for reversals). In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; use trend context to interpret.

7) boll
- What it tells you: Centerline (20SMA) context and baseline for price movement.
- How to use: Price action around the Bollinger Middle (20SMA) can indicate pullbacks or continuations; tightening bands suggest volatility contraction ahead of a breakout, while widening bands imply rising volatility. Confirm breakouts with other signals.

8) atr
- What it tells you: Market volatility and risk envelope.
- How to use: Rising ATR signals higher volatility (adjust position sizing and stop placement accordingly). Use ATR in conjunction with stop-loss levels to adapt to current volatility.

Why this set is well-suited for AMD
- AMD tends to exhibit pronounced volatility around earnings, product cycles, and semiconductor demand dynamics. ATR and Bollinger-based signals help you gauge volatility and breakout potential.
- The mix covers both trend confirmation (50SMA, 200SMA) and momentum (10EMA, MACD family, RSI) so you can distinguish trend-following setups from mean-reversion or breakout setups.
- Including MACD and its signal/histogram helps you identify momentum shifts with a bit of redundancy but provides cross-checks for more robust entries/exits.
- RSI provides a complementary momentum filter to avoid chasing overextended moves, especially when the stock is in a strong uptrend.

What I’ll deliver once the data is loaded
- A full, data-backed report that applies the 8 indicators to AMD in the chosen window.
- For each indicator, I’ll summarize:
  - Current status (trend direction, momentum, volatility signals)
  - Recent crossovers or divergences (with dates)
  - Alignment across indicators (e.g., price above 50SMA and MACD bullish signal)
  - Key support/resistance inferred from SMA levels and Bollinger bands
  - Volatility/risk context from ATR
- A concise trading-context narrative (without a specific buy/sell recommendation unless you request one) that highlights likely scenarios and what signals would confirm or invalidate them.

Next steps (please pick one)
- Retry data pull now for the full window (2023-09-30 to 2025-09-30) and then generate the full indicators report.
- Or request a shorter window (e.g., last 1 year or last 6 months) to get a near-term view quickly.
- Or proceed with the 8-indicator plan and I’ll populate the analysis as soon as data is available, even if you’re okay with a forward-looking narrative in the meantime.

Proposed Markdown table: key ideas at-a-glance
| Indicator | What it measures | How to use for AMD | What to watch | Potential signals |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Bullish if price above and 50SMA rising; bearish if below/sloping down | Consistency of price above/below, crossovers with price | Price above 50SMA with upward slope; cross below 50SMA signals pullback risk |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend baseline | Bullish if price above 200SMA; bearish if below | Crosses with price; relative position to 50SMA | Golden/death-like context when 50SMA crosses 200SMA or price nears these levels |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Entry/exit timing in line with short-term momentum | Crosses with price; cross with 50SMA for trend filtering | Price crossing above/below 10EMA; momentum shifts |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Confirm momentum shifts; crossovers with macds add confidence | Alignment with price action and RSI | MACD cross above MACD signal; MACD above zero (bullish) or below zero (bearish) |
| macds | MACD signal line | Filter for MACD signals; reduces false signals | Cross with MACD; convergence/divergence with price | MACD above MACS with price strength = stronger signal |
| rsi | Momentum strength, overbought/oversold | Filter potential reversals; avoid overreaching in strong uptrends | Thresholds (70/30) and divergences | RSI rising toward/above 70 in uptrend; RSI near/under 30 in downtrend |
| boll | Centerline context, volatility framework | Breakout/mean-reversion context with middle band | Interaction with price and bands; band expansion/contraction | Price riding upper band in uptrends; bands widening signals higher volatility |
| atr | Volatility and risk | Guide position sizing and stop placement | Rising ATR = higher volatility; use with stops | ATR trending up indicates wider stops; low ATR indicates compression |

Notes
- I’ll fill in concrete numbers, dates, and signals once I can successfully pull AMD’s data. If you want, I can retry now, or you can specify a shorter window (e.g., last 1 year) to get a timely snapshot quickly.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or would you prefer I analyze a shorter window (e.g., last 12 months) first? If you have a preferred window or a specific trading timeframe (daily vs. intra-day), tell me and I’ll tailor the indicator setup accordingly.
