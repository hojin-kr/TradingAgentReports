Recommendation: BUY with a disciplined, staged entry and clear risk-controls, as outlined in the plan.

Why this fits now
- Bull thesis remains intact: AI/cloud growth is still a multi-year driver, with megacaps generating solid free cash flow and offering liquidity that supports controlled entry and exit.
- Risks acknowledged in the plan (concentration, rate sensitivity, regulatory risk) are mitigatable through a structured, staged approach, prespecified stops, hedges, and a defined exit protocol.

Implementation highlights (condensed)
- Position sizing: treat QQQ as a core growth sleeve, targeting a modest 2–6% of tradable equity, depending on risk budget and horizon.
- Staged entry (three tranches):
  - Tranche 1: Buy 1/3 of intended exposure at current price.
  - Tranche 2: Add 1/3 if price pulls back toward the 470–480 zone.
  - Tranche 3: Complete with the final 1/3 if price tests 460–470 or holds above a defined floor.
- Price anchors to monitor: dip add near 470–480; reassess above 500 and especially around 520–540.
- Risk controls:
  - Hard stop around 452–460 on a close below, or a trailing stop of 8–10% from blended entry (whichever triggers first).
  - Pause further add-ons if a tranche moves against you beyond a pre-set threshold (example: -5% on that tranche within 2–3 trading days).
  - Hedging: consider a modest put or put spread on QQQ to guard against macro/earnings shocks without capping upside.
- Exit strategy:
  - Take partial profits if price advances 15–20% from blended entry to lock gains and rebalance.
  - Consider a longer-term target in the 520–540 range if the AI/cloud narrative remains intact and the rate environment stays supportive.
- Monitoring: weekly review around key levels; stay alert to earnings, regulatory headlines, and macro shifts; adjust exposure or hedges as needed.

Contingencies and adaptability
- If macro rate expectations or regulatory tensions worsen materially, scale back exposure and lean more on hedges or a selective, data-driven entry rather than maintaining full exposure.

Firm conclusion
- Given the framework, a Buy decision with disciplined, staged entry and robust risk controls best aligns with participating in upside while preventing outsized downside from a concentrated, rate-sensitive macro regime.
