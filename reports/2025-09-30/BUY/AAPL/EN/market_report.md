I’m ready to dive into the AAPL analysis, but I’m currently running into a backend issue retrieving the price data (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory) from the data source. I’ve attempted multiple times, and until that CSV is accessible I can’t generate the exact, data-driven trend signals and the final report with live numbers. If you’re able to retry in a moment or provide an alternative data window, I can pull the data and produce a full, numbers-backed analysis right away.

In the meantime, here’s a detailed framework I would use for AAPL and why these indicators are well-suited to provide complementary, non-redundant insight in a typical market context around late 2024–2025. I’ve selected 8 indicators (maximum allowed) to balance trend, momentum, volatility, and volume-context without overlap.

Selected indicators and rationale (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it signals: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s suitable: Helps identify the prevailing trend (bullish/bearish) over weeks-to-months and smooths out some noise. Useful to confirm signal timing when combined with faster indicators.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it signals: Long-term trend orientation and major dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s suitable: Provides macro-trend context. A price above the 200SMA supports a bullish regime; a cross of price below the 200SMA or a 50/200 cross can indicate longer-term regime shifts.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it signals: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action.
  - Why it’s suitable: More responsive than the 50/200 SMAs, helping identify early momentum changes or pullbacks that longer averages might smear.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it signals: Momentum and potential trend changes via EMA differences; crossovers and divergence.
  - Why it’s suitable: Combines momentum and trend insight. When macd crosses its signal line or moves toward/away from zero, it offers a timely signal that complements the slower moving averages.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it signals: Smoother confirmation of MACD-driven signals; crossovers with the MACD line.
  - Why it’s suitable: Reduces noise from the MACD line itself and helps validate entries/exits when used with macd.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it signals: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions; divergence warnings.
  - Why it’s suitable: Adds a momentum perspective and helps spot potential reversals that aren’t yet obvious from price-only indicators. Use with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.

- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - What it signals: Price action relative to a dynamic baseline (20-period SMA) and context for breakouts/mean reversion.
  - Why it’s suitable: Serves as a dynamic benchmark for price movement. When price hugs or breaches the middle line, it clarifies whether price action is leaning toward baseline expansion or reversion, especially when paired with bands or other volatility measures.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it signals: Market volatility levels, useful for risk management (stop placement, position sizing).
  - Why it’s suitable: ATR provides a practical read on how much price tends to move daily/weekly, informing stop-loss distance and risk per trade, which is critical in a stock like AAPL that can exhibit episodic volatility around earnings, product cycles, or macro shifts.

Notes on interpretation approach (when data is available)
- Confirm trend direction with a multi-timeframe lens: use close_200_sma as the backbone trend, cross-check with close_50_sma for intermediate trend, and observe close_10_ema for entry timing.
- Use MACD signals for momentum confirmation: look for MACD line crossovers relative to zero and corroborate with macds crossovers to reduce false positives.
- Watch RSI for overbought/oversold conditions in the context of trend: RSI alone isn’t a signal in strong trends; combine with trend indicators (50/200 SMA, MACD) to identify reversals vs. pullbacks.
- Consider Boll middle as a baseline plus volatility context: price moving consistently above the boll middle with expansion in other indicators can indicate a stronger move; price receding toward/into the middle line can signal consolidation or pullback.
- Use ATR to tailor risk management: larger ATR values suggest wider stop loss tolerances; smaller ATR indicates tighter risk bands. This helps adjust position sizing in line with current volatility.

What I will deliver once the data CSV is accessible
- A fully data-backed, nuanced trend report for AAPL covering:
  - Price action interpretation in relation to the 50SMA, 200SMA, and 10-EMA.
  - MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram dynamics, including crossovers and divergences.
  - RSI levels and divergences in the context of the prevailing trend.
  - Bollinger baseline interpretation and recent price relation to the middle line.
  - ATR-driven volatility insights and risk-adjusted considerations.
- Cross-checks and a concise verdict (Buy/Hold/Sell) only if you request a trade proposal after I have the data. I will prefix any final decision with FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY/HOLD/SELL if you want a concrete trade recommendation.

Proposed next steps
- Retry data retrieval for AAPL today (or specify a shorter date window such as 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-30) to see if the CSV can be located.
- If the data source remains unavailable, I can proceed with an indicators-only framework using static assumptions or switch to a different data source if you approve.

Markdown table: key indicators and their roles (for quick reference)
- Indicator | Category | What it signals / Role | How to use
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above indicates bullish tone; cross with other signals for entries.
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend orientation | Price above supports uptrend; watch for golden/death cross signals.
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below can signal quick momentum shifts; use with longer averages for filtering.
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend-change signals | Look for crossovers with MACD line; corroborate with RSI and price action.
- macds | MACD Signal | Smoother MACD confirmations | Use crossovers with MACD line for tighter entry/exit timing.
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold levels and divergence | Watch 70/30 thresholds and divergences in the context of trend.
- boll | Volatility / Baseline | Baseline for price action and potential breakouts | Breakouts beyond middle line or bands require confirmation from other indicators.
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility and risk management | Use for stop placement and position sizing adjustments.

If you’d like me to proceed with an alternative data source or try again now, say the word and I’ll retry or adjust the window accordingly. Once I have the data, I’ll deliver a full, granular report with live trend insights and the requested Markdown table.
