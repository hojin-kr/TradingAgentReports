I hit a backend error retrieving Reddit data for AAPL on 2025-09-30: FileNotFoundError. That looks like a temporary issue with the data source.

I can do one of the following:
- Retry fetching the Reddit stock info now and proceed with the full long report once it succeeds.
- Try again after a short delay and/or at a later time.
- Proceed with a plan to produce a high-level analysis using other available data sources (if you’re okay with that) and draft the report structure now, so you’re ready to drop in the Reddit data once it’s accessible.

What would you like me to do? If you want me to retry now, I’ll initiate another fetch and then generate the comprehensive sentiment-and-news report with a Markdown table at the end.
