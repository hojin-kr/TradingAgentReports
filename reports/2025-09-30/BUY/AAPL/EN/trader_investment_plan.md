Decision: Buy (with disciplined, staged entry and risk controls)

Why this aligns with the proposed plan
- Durable earnings power: Services growth and on-device AI monetization offer margin expansion and higher earnings visibility beyond hardware cycles.
- Balance sheet and returns: Strong cash generation and buyback capacity provide downside protection and per-share upside potential.
- Optionality in ecosystem: AI-enabled features, health/wearables, and AR groundwork add optional upside that can support multiple expansion over 12–24 months.
- Managed risk thesis: Near-term risks acknowledged (iPhone demand softness, AI monetization timing, macro/regulatory headwinds) are addressed via a structured entry, hedges, and clear risk controls.

Execution plan (practical and staged)
- Entry strategy: Initiate with 25–40% of the intended full position now. Plan two follow-on tranches at:
  - A pullback trigger of roughly 5–8% from the prior tranche price, or
  - On verifiable progress in Services growth and AI monetization milestones.
- Risk management: Use a protective collar or a long_put hedge financed by selling an OTM_call to cap downside while maintaining upside. Alternatively, implement a simple protective put for 6–12 months if you prefer a straightforward hedge.
- Hard stop: Set a stop loss around 15–20% below your average entry price, adjusted for position size and risk tolerance.
- Monitoring/triggers: 
  - Positive signals: sustained Services revenue/margin expansion; meaningful AI-enabled ARPU uplift; robust free cash flow and buyback cadence.
  - Technicals: 50-day vs 200-day moving average signal, RSI behavior with a structured plan to trim/add if momentum diverges.
- Time horizon: 12–24 months. Reassess if Services/AI monetization stalls or macro/regulatory risk intensifies; consider scaling back or tightening risk if warranted.
- Data gaps: Where price or sentiment signals are unavailable, rely on guidance, quarterly commentary, and cross-source validation for decision points.

Operational discipline and learning loop
- Avoid single-signal bets (no AI hype without monetization proof). Use multi-signal confirmation and explicit milestones.
- Maintain guardrails: defined entry/exit points, hedges, and contingency plans for data quality gaps.
- Distinguish near-term operational prints from durable value drivers (Services margin, AI monetization, ecosystem leverage) to avoid overreacting to noise.

Bottom line
- The plan’s core thesis is constructive: participate in the upside with a disciplined, risk-managed approach that positions for a re-rating driven by Services and AI-enabled monetization over 12–24 months, while limiting exposure to near-term volatility.
