I attempted to fetch TSLA fundamentals (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin financials) but I’m hitting a tool error:

- Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

This means I can’t currently pull the data from the provided tools to build the full, data-backed report you asked for.

What I can do right now
- Provide a thorough framework for TSLA’s fundamentals and what to look for, so you can see exactly what would fill the report once data access is restored.
- Offer a best-effort qualitative assessment of TSLA’s fundamental drivers and risk factors based on typical, well-known drivers (revenue growth, margins, capital expenditure, cash flow generation, balance sheet strength, competitive position, and regulatory environment). Note: this would not include the latest quarter figures or insider activity until the data tools are back online.
- Retry data pulls as soon as the tool issue is resolved to deliver a complete, numbers-backed report with the required Markdown table.

Proposed path forward
1) I retry data retrieval as soon as the tools become available again, then deliver:
   - Comprehensive income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow with the latest quarterly figures (and year-over-year trends).
   - Insider sentiment and insider transaction summaries for the past 15 days.
   - Key fundamental signals and their implications for traders (e.g., margin trajectory, capex intensity, FCF, debt maturity profile).
   - A detailed, granular analysis with fine-grained insights and trade-ready takeaways.
   - A Markdown table at the end that distills the core points (key metrics, trends, risks, catalysts, and trading considerations).

2) If you’d prefer to proceed immediately without the data pull, I can provide:
   - A rigorous qualitative TSLA fundamentals narrative (driver-by-driver) and a risk-adjusted view for this week, plus a ready-to-fill template you can drop numbers into later.
   - A hypothetical example table structure showing how the final Markdown table will look.

Please tell me which option you’d like:
- Option A: Wait for the data tools to return TSLA’s latest numbers and I’ll deliver the full report with the Markdown table.
- Option B: I provide a detailed qualitative fundamentals analysis for TSLA right now, plus the exact table format. Then I’ll populate with numbers once data access is restored.

If you want a quick preview of the table format I’ll include, here’s the structure I plan to use (to be completed with real data later):

- Company: TSLA
- Period: Latest quarter / TTM
- Key Income Statement Metrics: Revenue, Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Net Income, EPS
- Key Balance Sheet Metrics: Cash & Equivalents, Total Debt, Shareholders’ Equity, Net Debt
- Cash Flow: Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow
- Valuation/Returns (historic context): EBITDA, FCF Yield, ROIC
- Insider Activity: Net buys/sells (last 15 days), sentiment notes
- Growth & Efficiency Signals: Revenue growth CAGR, GM trajectory, capex intensity, D&A trends
- Risk/C catalysts: Key risks, upcoming catalysts, regulatory/compliance notes
- Trading Takeaways: Bull case, Bear case, Key scenarios, Suggested approach (HOLD/BUY/SELL)

Would you like me to proceed with Option A (wait for data) or Option B (provide a qualitative analysis now)?
