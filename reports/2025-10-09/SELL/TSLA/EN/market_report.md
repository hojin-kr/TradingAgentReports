I tried to fetch TSLA data to generate a current, data-driven report, but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry fetching the data now, or proceed with a thorough indicator framework and a detailed plan for how I’ll interpret the signals once data is available. Which would you prefer? If you’d like me to retry, I’ll run the data pull again immediately and then deliver a full, data-backed report.

In the meantime, here is a robust, complementary set of indicators I would use for TSLA and why, plus a detailed interpretation framework you can rely on once the data is retrieved.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why TSLA: TSLA often trades with meaningful mid-term trend shifts around the 50-day average, helping to filter noise from short-term moves.

- close_200_sma
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify broader regime (bullish vs bearish) and golden/death cross potential.
  - Why TSLA: As a high-volatility equity with secular drivers (EV demand, margins, production news), the 200-day line helps distinguish durable trend from shorter-term spikes.

- close_10_ema
  - Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum and potential entry/exit signals.
  - Why TSLA: TSLA can exhibit quick bursts of momentum around earnings, product announcements, or policy shifts; the 10-EMA captures shifts faster than the SMAs.

- macd
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals via MACD line crossing the signal.
  - Why TSLA: Demonstrates momentum shifts that can precede or confirm trend moves, useful in combination with trend baselines (50/200 SMA).

- macds
  - Purpose: MACD signal smoothing to trigger trades when MACD crosses the signal line.
  - Why TSLA: Provides a clearer confirmation filter for MACD-based entries/exits in a volatile name like TSLA.

- rsi
  - Purpose: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions (with potential divergences).
  - Why TSLA: In strong rallies or sharp pullbacks, RSI helps identify exhaustion or continuation risk, especially when used with trend context.

- atr
  - Purpose: Measure of volatility to inform risk management (position sizing and stop placements).
  - Why TSLA: TSLA’s volatility can spike around catalysts; ATR helps scale stops and size to reflect current risk.

- vwma
  - Purpose: Volume-confirmed trend using volume weighted by price.
  - Why TSLA: Volume can help validate price moves, especially on breakouts or pullbacks, where TSLA often experiences surges in participation.

How to interpret signals once data is available (detailed, scenario-focused)
- Trend context:
  - If price is above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma with a positive slope on all three (50, 200, and 10 EMA), expect a bullish regime. Use VWMA for volume confirmation: rising VWMA with strong price > VWMA supports continuation.
  - If price sits below both SMAs with the 50/200 SMA in a bearish configuration, treat rallies as potential relief moves unless MACD/MACD signals confirm a trend change.

- Momentum signals:
  - MACD crossing above the MACD signal (macd > macds) supports a bullish entry, especially when aligned with price above major moving averages.
  - MACD crossing below its signal supports a bearish signal, particularly if price is testing or under key support made by the 50/200 SMA.
  - RSI approaching or crossing 70 (overbought) could indicate a near-term pullback, whereas RSI near or crossing 30 (oversold) could precede a bounce, but always confirm with trend and volatility context.

- Volatility and risk:
  - ATR rising as price trends higher suggests a robust move with room to run; use ATR to adjust stops and position sizes.
  - If ATR expands during consolidation or near breakouts, it may indicate a breakout with high follow-through risk or opportunity; confirm with VWMA and MACD.

- Confirmation layering:
  - Use VWMA in tandem with price action: a rally above VWMA on strong volume adds conviction; price moving higher with weak VWMA volume warrants caution.
  - Divergence checks: MACD histogram (if you monitor it) showing shrinking momentum while price makes a new high could warn of a pullback; RSI divergence (price making higher highs while RSI fails to) similarly suggests potential reversals.

- Practical trading-ready interpretations (example scenarios):
  - Bullish setup: Price above 50SMA and 200SMA; MACD rising with MACD > MACD signal; RSI not yet overbought; ATR rising modestly; VWMA confirms with rising volume.
  - Cautious bull with risk: Price above mid-term but near 50SMA; MACD positive but waning; RSI around 60-70; ATR accelerating; volume surges on up days but not on down days (watch for distribution).
  - Bearish setup: Price below 50SMA and 200SMA; MACD crossing below signal; RSI dipping toward 30 with momentum continuing; ATR rising with large downside moves; VWMA weakening on down days.
  - Breakout/volatility-driven entry: Price consolidates near a level with ATR rising; VWMA confirms with increasing volume on a breakout above resistance or below support; MACD provides corroboration if it turns positive/negative in the breakout direction.

Notes, caveats, and practical tips
- Data quality and alignment: Ensure the data series are aligned (daily close prices) and that the indicators receive the same time frame. TSLA’s intraday news flow and events (earnings, guidance, supply chain) can cause gaps; interpret signals with this in mind.
- Catalyst awareness: Earnings, product announcements, regulatory changes, and macro shifts can create impulsive moves that short-term indicators may misread. Use ATR and VWMA to gauge whether moves have sustain or are quick spikes.
- Position sizing and risk controls: Let ATR guide stop distances to avoid being stopped out by normal volatility, and use a reasonable percentage of capital per idea (e.g., 1-3% risk per trade, adjusted by volatility).
- Avoid overfitting: Don’t rely on a single signal. The combination of trend (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum (MACD + MACD signal), momentum strength (RSI), and volatility/volume (ATR + VWMA) provides a robust, cross-validated framework.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the TSLA data now and then deliver a fully data-backed, granular report with live readings for each indicator, plus a detailed narrative of the current setup, strength/weakness of the prevailing moves, and explicit trade ideas (with entry, stop, and target considerations) based on the exact dates you care about.
- If you prefer not to wait, I can generate an actionable guidance based on the framework above and your preferred time horizon (e.g., next 1-2 weeks, or swing/position horizon) with example signal thresholds.

Markdown table: key indicators and interpretation framework
- Below is a compact, at-a-glance reference you can use until the data is fetched.

| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret in TSLA context | Bullish signals | Bearish signals | Practical usage notes |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price above with rising slope = healthier trend; below = risk of pullback | Price above 50SMA, rising; 50SMA rising | Price below 50SMA, 50SMA falling | Use as baseline trend filter; combine with momentum signals |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA indicates long-term uptrend; below indicates downtrend | Price above 200SMA; 200SMA rising | Price below 200SMA; 200SMA falling | Key regime indicator; watch for golden/death cross cues |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum responsiveness | Quick shifts in momentum; near-term entry/exit signals | 10EMA above price and rising; cross above price | 10EMA below price and falling; cross below | Use for timing with trend context and longer averages |
| macd | Momentum and trend-change signals (MACD line vs signal) | Crossings confirm momentum shifts | MACD crossing above MACD signal; positive histogram | MACD crossing below MACD signal; negative histogram | Best when aligned with trend (SMA direction) |
| macds | MACD signal smoothing | Additional confirmation of MACD signals | MACD > MACD signal consistently | MACD < MACD signal consistently | Helps reduce false positives from MACD alone |
| rsi | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold | RSI near extremes can signal reversals or continuation | RSI rising toward overbought but with trend strength; bullish divergence | RSI falling into oversold with breakdown; bearish divergence | Use with trend; strong trends can push RSI to extremes without immediate reversal |
| atr | Market volatility level; risk/stop guidance | Higher ATR = more room for moves; adjust stops/position sizes | ATR rising with price gains; breakout context supported | ATR rising on downside or spike without trend support | Critical for risk management and sizing |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend; price-volume alignment | Volume growth during price moves strengthens legitimacy | Price > VWMA with rising volume | Price < VWMA with declining volume | Validate price action with volume; avoid false breakouts without volume support |

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now and deliver a fully data-backed, narrative TSLA report (including exact current readings, signals, and explicit trade ideas), just say the word and I’ll run the data pull again immediately.
