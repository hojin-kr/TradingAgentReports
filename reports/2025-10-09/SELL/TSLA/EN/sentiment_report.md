I ran into a tooling error while trying to fetch TSLA Reddit stock news for 2025-10-09. The Reddit data fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t yet have the day-by-day social sentiment and Reddit-aggregated posts to base a full, data-driven report on.

What I can do next (your call):
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now to obtain the latest TSLA social sentiment and Reddit headlines for 2025-10-09.
- If you prefer, proceed with a best-effort, non-tool-based analysis using publicly available context (high-level sentiment themes, recent company news, and typical drivers for TSLA) and clearly label it as non-live data until the Reddit tool returns.
- Or I can fetch sentiment and news from alternative sources you approve (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, major news outlets) if you want broader social coverage beyond Reddit.

In the meantime, here is a structured draft of the long-form report you asked for. It is labeled as a working draft and will be replaced with live data as soon as the Reddit tool is back online. I’ve kept it detailed so you can see the exact kinds of insights I’ll populate once the data is available.

Draft TSLA Social Sentiment & News Report (as of 2025-10-09)
- Executive snapshot
  - What’s likely driving sentiment: Tesla’s ongoing product cadence, pricing strategy, progress on Full Self-Driving (FSD) ambitions, production efficiency, and commentary from investors about margins and capex.
  - Snapshot risk/uncertainty: Regulatory scrutiny around driver-assistance tech, competition in the EV space, and macro demand signals for premium EVs.

- Social media sentiment overview (pending Reddit data)
  - Daily sentiment approach: track net sentiment (positive minus negative) on TSLA-related posts, compute engagement-weighted sentiment, and identify spikes around product/news events.
  - What to expect once data returns: sentiment clusters around price actions, delivery numbers, FSD updates, and executive commentary. A few example signal themes to look for:
    - Positive sentiment spikes around new software updates, production milestones, or favorable regulatory/partnership news.
    - Negative sentiment around FSD safety concerns, profits/returns, or supply chain issues.
    - Mixed sentiment around pricing moves or new model announcements.

- Recent company news (contextual, not live data)
  - Key themes to monitor (to be aligned with the Reddit data once retrieved): 
    - Product cadence news (new models, software features, energy products).
    - FSD regulatory milestones and safety disclosures.
    - Production guidance, capacity ramp, and gross margin trajectory.
    - Partnerships, supply chain updates, and geographic expansion.
  - Trade-off considerations for traders: reactions to any sign of margin expansion/compression, unit economics of new models, and how the market values autonomous tech progress.

- Daily sentiment architecture (how I’ll present once data is available)
  - Day-by-day sentiment score for TSLA with the following visualizations:
    - Net sentiment (positive minus negative)
    - Volume of TSLA-specific posts
    - Engagement-adjusted sentiment
    - Top themes by day (e.g., FSD, production, price cuts, new model)
  - A short narrative for each day explaining drivers behind sentiment shifts.

- News flow and reaction
  - Headline-level scan of Reddit posts and other sources (once available) to identify:
    - Recurrent events causing sentiment shifts
    - Any divergence between sentiment and price action (e.g., sentiment positive while price weak)
    - Notable outliers (extreme bullish or bearish posts) and their potential impact

- Trader-focused implications
  - Short-term (1–5 days)
    - How sentiment trends could influence intraday volatility on TSLA
    - Potential setups around major sentiment spikes (e.g., momentum plays, mean-reversion narratives)
  - Medium-term (1–4 weeks)
    - The interplay between product/news momentum and sentiment as input to probabilistic outcomes for price direction
  - Risk factors to monitor
    - FSD regulatory risk and safety narrative shifts
    - Margins and unit economics sensitivity to production ramp
    - Competitive landscape changes in EV and energy storage

- Sentiment data caveats
  - Reddit data can be noisy and prone to sudden spikes around memetic posts or coordinated activity.
  - The interpretation of sentiment should be paired with price/volume dynamics and news flow to avoid false signals.

- Makrdown table (key points, consolidated)
 
Here’s a template table I will fill with live data once the Reddit tool returns:

- Date
- Net Sentiment (Reddit)
- Post Volume (Reddit TSLA)
- Top Daily Themes
- Key News Headlines (from Reddit/other sources)
- Price Action Snapshot (Close, Day Change, Volume)
- Implied Trade Implication (Bullish / Neutral / Bearish)
- Notes / Data Gaps

Next steps and your choice
- If you want me to proceed with live data now, I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch for 2025-10-09 and then produce a full, narrative long-report with a finalized Markdown table.
- If you prefer to move forward without the Reddit data right this moment, I can generate a robust, non-live analysis using public context and clearly label it as provisional. I can also incorporate alternative data sources you approve.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or should I proceed with an alternative data approach (and which sources would you prefer)?
