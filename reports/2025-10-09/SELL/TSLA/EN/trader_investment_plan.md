Decision: Sell TSLA (primary stance)

Rationale (high-level, data-driven summary)
- Near-term risk factors align with the bear thesis: margin pressure from aggressive price cuts, ongoing capex intensity, and uncertainty around near-term monetization of FSD and energy software.
- Competitive dynamics are intensifying, with multiple automakers closing gaps on price, features, and software; valuation remains sensitive to any miss on margins or profitability.
- The plan you shared already emphasizes a disciplined risk-control approach and hedging; given the current setup, locking in profits or reducing exposure mitigates downside while preserving optionality for future data-driven re-entry.

Actionable execution plan (concrete steps to implement now)
1) Reduce exposure
- If you hold a full TSLA position, trim by at least 50% today. If you’re smaller, adjust the reduction proportionally to target a 3–5% total portfolio weight or wherever you’re most comfortable reducing idiosyncratic risk.
- If you’re already lighter, consider a proportional partial exit to avoid over-hedging or excessive trading costs.

2) Establish risk controls on the remaining position
- Place a protective stop on the remaining stake (for example, 15–20% below your entry price) or implement a trailing stop that moves with price action, depending on your risk tolerance.
- Define a clear price-based re-entry or exit trigger if near-term data improves or deteriorates (e.g., margins stabilize/improve vs. worsen further).

3) Hedge the residual exposure
- Use options to cap downside while preserving some upside: consider a bear put tilt (bear put spread or collar) with a horizon around 2–4 months to align with the thesis.
- Ensure hedges are cost-efficient (liquidity, tight bid/ask, appropriate IV environment) and sized to the remaining position so you don’t erode returns if TSLA moves higher.

4) Monitor and re-evaluate triggers
- Key data to track: quarterly gross margin trajectory, cadence and payback of capex, progress on FSD monetization (subscriptions, per-vehicle monetization), energy segment performance, and regional demand signals (EU/China).
- Price action triggers: reassess if TSLA sustains a rally with meaningful margin improvement or if fundamentals deteriorate; accelerate exits or adjust hedges if new data worsens the thesis.

5) Portfolio context and diversification
- Reallocate proceeds into hedged or lower-volatility names with exposure to the same macro themes (electric mobility, AI software, energy tech) but with more favorable near-term risk-reward.
- Consider a mix of hedged or market-neutral exposures to maintain exposure to longer-term themes without concentrated risk on a single high-volatility name.

6) Documentation and learning
- Keep a decision log: document the data, triggers, hedge choices, and outcomes. Use this to refine the framework for future rounds.

Practical notes
- For hedges, start with modest size relative to the remaining exposure to avoid over-hedging if the stock rallies.
- Prioritize liquidity and cost efficiency when choosing options (opt for appropriate durations, watch spreads, and implied volatilities).
- Align any re-entry with a data-driven signal; do not let a temporary bounce lure you back in without a confirmed improvement in fundamentals.

If you want, I can tailor the exact trim size, stop levels, and hedge strikes to your current position, risk tolerance, and portfolio size. Finally, the plan emphasizes disciplined risk management and data-driven re-evaluation to avoid large, irreversible losses from near-term headwinds.
