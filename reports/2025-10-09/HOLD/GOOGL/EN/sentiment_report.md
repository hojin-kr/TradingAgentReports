Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based stock news for GOOGL on 2025-10-09, but I hit an internal error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) from the Reddit data tool. It looks like the data source is temporarily unavailable or misconfigured right now.

How would you like to proceed? Here are a few options:
- Retry now: I can try the Reddit data retrieval again immediately.
- Retry with an alternate date window: I can pull data for a nearby date (e.g., 2025-10-08 or a 7-day window) to still capture sentiment trends.
- Proceed with a framework now: I can deliver a detailed analysis framework and a placeholder report structure, then fill in the actual sentiment and news content as soon as the data tool is available again.
- Use an alternative data source: If you’re open to it, I could compile sentiment and news insights from other sources (e.g., general social media chatter, headlines from major outlets) once the data tool is working or if you grant access to another data feed.

If you’d like me to proceed with options, please tell me which one to pick. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the final long-form report once I have the sentiment and news data for GOOGL, so you know what to expect:
