I tried to fetch GOOGL data from Yahoo Finance using the data tool, but it’s currently failing with a FileNotFoundError on the data path. I can’t access the price history right now, so I can’t generate the actual indicator values or a live trend report at this moment. If you’d like, I can retry in a bit or proceed with a solid plan and the exact indicators we’ll use once data retrieval succeeds. In the meantime, here is a precise, non-redundant indicator setup I’ll apply and a detailed framework for the resulting report.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-period Simple Moving Average
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify bias (above = bullish bias, below = bearish bias).
- close_200_sma: 200-period Simple Moving Average
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark, helps confirm macro trend (golden/death cross risk over longer horizons).
- close_10_ema: 10-period Exponential Moving Average
  - Purpose: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action; useful for timely entry/exit signals when aligned with longer-term trend.
- macd: MACD line
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend strength; crossovers across zero and relative to price provide signals with confirmation from other indicators.
- macds: MACD Signal
  - Purpose: Smoother signal line; MACD line crossing above/below this line generates trade triggers with reduced noise.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index
  - Purpose: Momentum/overbought-oversold conditions; 70/30 thresholds and confirmations with trend help locate reversals or continuations.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA basis for bands)
  - Purpose: Dynamic baseline to assess breakout or retracement potential; serves as a reference for band interactions and mean-reversion context.
- atr: Average True Range
  - Purpose: Volatility gauge for risk management; helps set stop distances and adjust position sizing to current volatility regime.

Why this set is suitable
- It covers the core dimensions: trend (50/200 SMA+10 EMA), momentum (MACD family + RSI), volatility (ATR), and mean-reversion/band context (Bollinger middle).
- It avoids redundancy by not overloading with all three MACD components (MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram) in a single pass. I’ve included the MACD line and the MACD signal, which usually provide clean signals when used together with RSI and moving averages.
- It balances timeframes: medium- to long-term trend via SMAs, short-term momentum via EMA, mid-term momentum via MACD, and risk controls via ATR.

What the final, detailed report will cover (once data is available)
- Market context for GOOGL (as of 2025-10-09): overall trend bias (bullish/bearish/sideways) using 50/200 SMA crossovers as a structural guide, with short-term momentum confirmed by the 10 EMA and MACD.
- Trend analysis:
  - Where price sits relative to 50 SMA and 200 SMA (crossovers, support/resistance implications).
  - Any short-term momentum signals from MACD crossovers and RSI behavior.
- Momentum and overextension:
  - RSI readings and any divergences with price action.
  - MACD histogram dynamics to gauge strength of moves and potential reversals.
- Volatility and risk management:
  - ATR-derived stop-loss contexts and how current volatility affects position sizing.
  - Bollinger middle’s interaction with price to assess mean-reversion vs breakout potential.
- Trade signal framework:
  - Example entry criteria (e.g., price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA, MACD bullish crossover, RSI rising from oversold).
  - Exit criteria (reverse crossovers, RSI overbought region, price returning to/below SMA levels, ATR-based stop tightening).
- Contextual notes:
  - How to handle choppy/low-volatility regimes (adjust thresholds, rely more on trend filters).
  - How to combine signals to reduce false positives (e.g., require alignment of at least two indicators before acting).

Proposed interpretation framework (how I’ll translate signals into actionable insights)
- Trend alignment: A bullish setup when price is above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with MACD above signal and rising, and RSI not in overbought extreme unless supported by strong price action.
- Breakout/mean-reversion cues: Bollinger middle alignment with price breaking above/below the upper/lower band, confirmed by MACD and RSI behavior.
- Risk controls: Use ATR to set stop-loss distance; adjust position size as ATR expands or contracts; prefer trades with favorable risk-reward when multiple indicators align.

Appendix: Markdown table for key indicators, purposes, and signals (to be filled with actual data once available)

| Indicator | Category | What it Measures / Signals | How to Use for Entry/Exit |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above → bullish bias; cross above/below signal trend changes; use with longer-term trend for confirmation |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark, golden/death cross context | Price above/below indicates macro trend; look for crossovers with 50 SMA for strategic entries |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum and quick shifts | Price crossing above/below can flag entry/exit; confirm with longer-term indicators |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend strength | Bullish/bearish cross with MACD line; combine with price and RSI signals |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line for refined timing | MACD line crossing MACDs signal line as triggers; seek alignment with price action |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold, momentum strength | Readings near extreme levels plus trend context; look for divergences and crossovers |
| boll | Volatility/Mean-reversion | Bollinger middle baseline; mean-reversion context | Price interactions with middle band and bands indicate potential breakouts or reversals; confirm with other indicators |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility level; stop sizing | Use for risk management and stop placement; adapt position size to volatility regime |

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and proceed to generate the full, detailed report with the actual indicator values and a populated Markdown table.
- Alternatively, if you want to proceed immediately, I can provide a fully prepared analysis framework using these indicators and you can supply the data later to fill in the specifics.

Would you like me to retry the data retrieval now, or would you prefer I wait and proceed with the plan once data access is restored?
