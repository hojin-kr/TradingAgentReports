I ran the data retrieval attempts for PLTR, but all calls returned a backend file-not-found error. In short, the data sources (Finnhub/SimFin) aren’t returning results right now, so I can’t assemble the full fundamental report with live figures at the moment.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval now or at a later time (e.g., after a short window) to see if the backend issues resolve.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a detailed, best-effort qualitative analysis in the meantime (without fresh figures) and clearly label where data is missing until the numbers are available.
- Alternatively, you can provide the data (or copy/paste key figures) and I’ll integrate it into the report right away.

What the final report will include (once data is available)
- Company profile: business model, segments (Government vs Commercial), major customers, and positioning.
- Recent financial snapshot: latest quarterly metrics (revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income), and year-over-year/quarter-over-quarter context.
- Balance sheet highlights: assets, liabilities, liquidity metrics, working capital, cash equivalents.
- Cash flow summary: operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow, financing activities.
- Income statement detail: revenue by segment, cost structure, SGA, R&D, depreciation/amortization.
- Key financial ratios and trends: profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency, and cash flow metrics across the last several quarters.
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions: directional tone from the past 15 days, notable buys/sells, concentration of ownership changes.
- Historical view: 4–8 quarter history to identify structural changes, seasonality, or one-off items.
- Risks and catalysts: regulatory, competitive, product adoption, government exposure, and diversification of revenue.
- Summary for traders: actionable takeaways, potential catalysts, and risk flags based on the data.

Proposed Markdown table (placeholder until data is filled)
- I’ll convert this to a crisp, reader-friendly table once data is in.

| Section | Key data points (to fill) | Observations / trader takeaways |
|---|---|---|
| Company profile |  |  |
| Revenue (latest quarter) |  |  |
| Gross margin |  |  |
| Operating margin |  |  |
| Net income |  |  |
| Cash & equivalents |  |  |
| Debt (long/short) |  |  |
| Free cash flow |  |  |
| Insider sentiment (15 days) |  |  |
| Insider transactions (past 15 days) |  |  |
| Key risks |  |  |
| Catalysts |  |  |

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry data retrieval now and, if successful, generate the full, detailed report with the Markdown table appended?
- Or would you prefer that I proceed with a qualitative snapshot in the meantime and finalize the data-driven report as soon as the data sources return?
