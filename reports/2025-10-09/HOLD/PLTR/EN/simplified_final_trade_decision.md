# Investment Report: PLTR
## Executive Summary
Palantir provides data analysis tools for government and business. Near-term concerns include government exposure, high valuation, and uncertain growth from non-government clients. Hold until sustainable yearly recurring revenue growth from non-government clients and early margin lift are evident.

## Investment Decision
Hold PLTR. Confidence: Medium.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Diversified platform potential: Foundry commercialization and cross-sell opportunities could boost recurring revenue and eventually improve margins.
- Valuation vs. near-term profits: The stock prices in strong long-run profits; near-term profits are not guaranteed.
- Government exposure risk: Heavy reliance on government contracts can affect visibility and margins with political or budget changes.
- Need for tangible milestones: Durable non-government revenue growth and early margin lift are needed to re-rate the stock.

## Risks To Watch
- Government budget cycles: Shifts in public spending could reduce demand or renewals.
- Competitive pressure: Large data/AI platforms could erode Palantirâ€™s moat; cross-sell ramps may be slower than hoped.
- Sales cycle risk: Long pilots and sales cycles could delay meaningful ARR growth.
- Data/regulatory issues: News or governance problems could hurt credibility and timing.
- Valuation risk: If milestones are not met, the stock could face multiple compression.
