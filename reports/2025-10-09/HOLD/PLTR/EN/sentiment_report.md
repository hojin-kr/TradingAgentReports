I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based sentiment data for PLTR for 2025-10-03 through 2025-10-09, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool issue). Because of that, I don’t yet have the day-by-day Reddit sentiment feed to base a precise, week-long sentiment chart on. I can either retry now (and we can wait for the tool to come back), or proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using public/company news and known sentiment drivers, clearly labeled as provisional until the Reddit data comes back.

Here are two options:
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now and deliver a fully data-backed week-long sentiment report as soon as the tool succeeds.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, data-light report focused on themes, catalysts, and implications for traders, with a clear note where Reddit data would refine the view.

If you’d like, I can start with Option B immediately and then switch to Option A as soon as the tool is available. In the meantime, here is a draft qualitative analysis framework and initial take based on typical Palantir sentiment drivers, plus a planning table you can use to populate precise numbers once the Reddit data is in.

Draft qualitative analysis (no tool-dependent numbers yet)

1) Overall sentiment context for PLTR (past week)
- General tenor tends to oscillate between cautious enthusiasm and skepticism, driven by growth expectations in commercial platforms (Foundry for non-government customers) vs. concerns about profitability and long-term valuation.
- Key sentiment levers typically include: AI/automation capabilities, government contract news, customer wins in commercial sectors, product roadmap updates, and quarterly guidance.

2) Topics likely to appear in social chatter
- AI and data platform capabilities: Discussions often center on how Palantir Foundry and Apollo automate data workflows, potential AI model integrations, and performance in real-world deployments.
- Government vs. commercial mix: Palantir’s exposure to government contracts (which can be sizable) vs. commercial enterprise traction can drive divergent sentiment. Government wins are often bullish for longer-term reliability, while commercial metrics are scrutinized for margin and growth.
- Profitability and cash flow: Retail and retail-like investors frequently discuss path to profitability, operating margins, and efficiency gains. Any commentary on cost control, headcount, or capital efficiency tends to move sentiment.
- Valuation and risk: TR equity risk, multiples, and comparisons to peers (AI/infra/data-platform players) tend to surface, especially if recent price action has been volatile.
- News catalysts: Any earnings chatter, guidance revisions, new partnerships, or notable customer wins/losses typically spikes bullish or bearish discussion.

3) Potential week-long sentiment patterns to expect
- Positive sentiment spikes around:
  - Positive quarterly results or better-than-expected guidance, especially if commercial growth accelerates.
  - Announcements of new strategic partnerships or larger enterprise deals.
  - Demonstrations of platform AI capabilities improving time-to-value for customers.
- Negative sentiment spikes around:
  - Missed targets, slower-than-expected commercial adoption, or concerns about profitability/FCF.
  - Regulatory concerns or increased scrutiny over data/privacy implications.
  - Competitive pressure from analogous platforms or cost-cutting measures impacting growth.

4) Implications for traders
- If Reddit/X sentiment leans bullish around AI capability wins and enterprise deals, it could short-term push PLTR higher on momentum, especially if coupled with improving guidance.
- If sentiment highlights profitability concerns, expect potential pullbacks or increased volatility, even if top-line growth remains solid.
- Rotation risk: Palantir often trades on narrative around AI and government exposure; shifting narratives (e.g., broader AI platform adoption vs. government-only revenue) can cause rapid sentiment reversals.
- Risk management: In a week with mixed sentiment, trading strategies might favor option structures (e.g., straddles or calendars) to capture volatility if key catalysts (earnings, product milestones, or government announcements) are anticipated.

5) Company news lens (what to watch for in the near term)
- New customer wins or expansions in Foundry for commercial sectors.
- Updates on Foundry/Apollo product roadmap, new modules, or performance improvements.
- Government contract news (awards, renewals, or policy shifts affecting procurement).
- Earnings/Guidance: any changes to revenue mix, gross margins, or cash flow targets.
- Regulatory or geopolitical developments affecting data security and compliance.

Next steps and data needs
- Once the Reddit data tool is back, collect the last 7 days of posts mentioning PLTR from Reddit (and related subs) and compute:
  - Daily sentiment scores (overall and by subtopic: AI, government, commercial, earnings, etc.)
  - Volume and velocity of posts
  - Top threads and their positions (bullish vs bearish)
  - Any notable divergences between sentiment and price action
- Combine with any available news headlines from credible outlets to form a holistic picture of sentiment vs. news narrative.
- Produce a week-long sentiment table and a consolidated narrative with trader-oriented implications.

Proposed Markdown table (structure to fill with actual data once Reddit data is available)

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (Option A), or
- Proceed immediately with the qualitative analysis (Option B) and we’ll attach the Reddit-driven specifics as soon as the tool is functioning again?

If you prefer, I can start with Option B right away and summarize the key themes and implications now, then switch to a data-backed version once Reddit data becomes available.
