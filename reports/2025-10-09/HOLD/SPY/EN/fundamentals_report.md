I attempted to fetch the SPY data across the five tools, but all calls returned a FileNotFoundError. That suggests these data connectors don’t currently have SPY data available in this environment (or SPY isn’t supported by these specific data feeds for the requested date).

What this means for SPY
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions: ETFs like SPY typically don’t have meaningful “insider” activity data in the same way a corporate issuer does. The data sources may not provide actionable insider signals for SPY.
- SimFin balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement: SPY is a fund that holds a basket of securities rather than issuing a single consolidated corporate financial statement. The fund’s financials are asset/liability-based and tracked differently than a company’s income statement or cash flow. The SimFin tools you provided are designed for company-level financials and may not return meaningful SPY data.

What I can do next (options)
1) Switch to a company ticker you’re interested in (e.g., AAPL, MSFT) and complete a full fundamental report with insider sentiment/transactions and SimFin financial statements.
2) Proceed with a high-level ETF fundamentals analysis of SPY using standard fund metrics (AUM, expense ratio, dividend yield, liquidity, tracking error, distribution history) if you’re okay with me pulling from alternative sources or relying on typical ETF metrics (while avoiding speculative numbers).
3) Attempt the SPY analysis again later if you’d like me to retry the exact data calls, or we can try a closely related ETF/holding (e.g., VOO, IVV) that may be better supported by these tools.

If you’d like me to proceed with option 1 (a specific company), tell me which ticker. If you prefer option 2 (ETF fundamentals), I’ll provide a detailed SPY ETF fundamentals-oriented report structure and insights based on the standard metrics, clearly noting any data gaps due to the tool limitations.

Markdown table (data retrieval status and next steps)
| Data Source / Type | Ticker | Current Date | Status | Notes / Next Steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Finnhub Insider Sentiment | SPY | 2025-10-09 | Unavailable (FileNotFoundError) | ETFs often have no traditional insider sentiment data; consider switching to a company ticker for this data. |

| SimFin Cashflow | SPY | 2025-10-09 (quarterly) | Unavailable (FileNotFoundError) | Same limitation as balance sheet; fund-level cash flows differ from company statements. |
| SimFin Income Statement | SPY | 2025-10-09 (quarterly) | Unavailable (FileNotFoundError) | ETF financials not presented as company P&L in this dataset. |
| Overall ETF fundamentals (if pursued) | SPY | 2025-10-09 | To be determined | Would cover AUM, expense ratio, yield, liquidity, tracking error; data would come from fund sponsor/market data sources. |

Would you like me to:

- Try again with a different ticker (e.g., a large-cap company like AAPL) to complete the full fundamental report, or
- Move forward with a high-level SPY ETF fundamentals overview using standard metrics (acknowledging potential data source gaps), or
- Compare SPY with another similar ETF (VOO/IVV) for a quick relative assessment?
