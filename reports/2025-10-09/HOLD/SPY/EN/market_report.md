I tried to fetch SPY data with get_YFin_data, but I’m currently hitting a backend FileNotFoundError. Attempts with several date ranges (including 2010-01-01 through 2025-10-09 and 2018-01-01 through 2025-10-09) all failed. This looks like a temporary data source issue on the backend, not your request. I can retry fetching now, or proceed with the indicator plan and generate the full report as soon as data becomes available. How would you like to proceed?

In the meantime, I’ve prepared a concise, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators that provides diverse, complementary insights for SPY (the S&P 500 ETF). I’ve chosen indicators that cover trend, momentum, volatility, and volume to give a well-rounded view without overlap.

Selected indicators (8) and why they fit SPY now
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages): Medium-term trend direction; helps identify the prevailing trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming broad market direction (bullish/bearish bias) and filtering faster signals.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages): Long-term trend benchmark; confirms macro trend, helps spot golden/death cross tendencies, and provides strategic context for trades with longer horizons.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages): Responsive short-term momentum signal; helps catch quicker shifts in SPY’s momentum that may precede larger moves when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd (MACD): Momentum indicator showing differences between two EMAs; useful for spotting trend changes via crossovers and divergence, especially in clear trending regimes.
- macds (MACD Signal): The MACD’s EMA smoothing; crossovers with the MACD line give trade triggers and help filter signals from the MACD histogram.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum oscillator highlighting overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; useful for timing entries when used with trend context to avoid buying into overbought conditions in strong uptrends.
- boll (Bollinger Middle): The 20-period SMA that serves as a baseline for Bollinger Bands; provides a volatility-adjusted benchmark and helps identify breakouts or pullbacks when prices interact with bands.
- atr (ATR): Measures volatility; informs risk management, stop placement, and position sizing in SPY’s current volatility regime, which has varied meaningfully across the 2020s.

What I’ll do once data is available
- Retrieve SPY price data for a defined window (as you prefer, e.g., last 2–5 years or a specific range).
- Compute the 8 indicators above and generate a detailed, nuanced report with:
  - Trend analysis (how price relates to 50/200 SMA and 10 EMA)
  - Momentum signals (MACD, MACD Signal, RSI interactions with trend)
  - Volatility context (ATR behavior and Bollinger Middle interactions)
  - Volume/validation context if you want to add VWMA later (I can substitute or add it as a ninth indicator if desired)
  - Practical trade implications (quality of signal, likely scenarios, and risk considerations)
- Append a Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points and how you would trade SPY given the current setup.

Proposed next steps
- Option A: I retry data fetch now and, if successful, produce the full, detailed report with the 8 indicators and a markdown summary table.
- Option B: If you want me to proceed immediately with a plan without live data, I’ll run through a hypothetical interpretation framework using these indicators and provide a best-practice set of entry/exit ideas while clearly labeling that this would be based on assumed data until the fetch succeeds.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like me to retry now, I’ll do so right away and return the full report as soon as data retrieval succeeds.
