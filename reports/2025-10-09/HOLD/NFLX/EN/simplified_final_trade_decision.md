# Investment Report: NFLX
## Executive Summary
Netflix has potential from an ad-supported tier and international growth, but subscription growth slows and rights costs remain a hurdle. Recommendation: HOLD.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: HOLD. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Ad-supported tier could raise revenue, but the durability of gains in average revenue per user is unproven.
- International growth offers upside, but return on investment is uncertain and costs are high.
- Live-rights and licensing costs pose margin pressure; monetization depends on rights progress.
- Catalysts exist (ad metrics, rights progress, content slate milestones) but require real, verifiable progress to meaningfully shift risk/reward.

## Risks To Watch
- Ad-market softness and budget cuts could slow ad revenue growth.
- Sub growth may slow toward saturation; international ROI remains uncertain and costly.
- Live sports rights are expensive and uncertain; monetization may not meet expectations.
- Competition and macro ad-market weakness could compress the stock multiple if growth slows or rights costs surprise.
- Licensing and content costs could surprise to the downside, pressuring margins.
