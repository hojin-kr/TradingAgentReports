I tried to fetch NFLX price data, but the data tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError) for both date ranges I tested. It looks like the data source environment isn’t loading right now. I can retry with different date ranges, or proceed with a robust indicator setup and plan so we’re ready to produce a detailed, data-backed analysis as soon as the data fetch succeeds. Let me know which you prefer.

In the meantime, here are 8 carefully chosen indicators that give diverse, complementary insights for NFLX (Netflix) without redundancy. These will help you gauge trend, momentum, volatility, and potential entry/exit signals once we have fresh data.

Selected indicators (8 total) and rationale for NFLX:
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  - Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm current trend context when used with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful to identify overarching regime (bullish/bearish) and to spot golden/death cross tendencies over a broader horizon.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  - Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts in price action and potential entry timing when aligned with longer-term trends.
- macd: MACD
  - Purpose: Momentum and potential trend-change signals via crossovers, histogram shifts, and divergence clues.
- rsi: RSI
  - Purpose: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions; useful for spotting reversals in context with trend.
- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band
  - Purpose: Overbought zones and breakout potential. Signals where price may encounter resistance and potentially accelerate movements in strong trends.
- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band
  - Purpose: Oversold zones and reversal risk. Helps identify take-profit or reversal opportunities when used with price action and other signals.
- atr: ATR
  - Purpose: Volatility gauge for risk management. Helps set stop-loss levels and scale position sizing according to current volatility.

Notes on approach and how I’ll present the analysis once data is available:
- I’ll compute a detailed, nuanced trend report for NFLX, including:
  - How price interacts with the 50/200 SMA (is price respecting, crossing, or diverging from these levels?).
  - Short-term momentum signals from the 10 EMA and MACD (crossovers, momentum shifts, and divergences).
  - Momentum strength from RSI in relation to the trend (e.g., RSI in overbought/oversold zones vs. trend direction).
  - Volatility and breakout context from Bollinger bands (price touching/clarifying squeezes, band squeezes, and interactions with upper/lower bands).
  - Volatility-based risk framing from ATR to adjust stop levels and position sizing.
- I’ll include a granular, time-aligned narrative (e.g., how signals align around earnings events, subscriber-driven moves, or macro context) and provide concrete, scenario-based takeaways (e.g., when a bullish cross and price above major SMAs align with a rising ATR, etc.).
- I will append a Markdown table at the end that succinctly maps each indicator to its interpretation for NFLX and how to act on it.

Proposed next steps:
- Option A: I retry data retrieval with a broader or different date window (e.g., earlier in 2025, or a rolling 6–12 week window) to get a fresh dataset.
- Option B: If you already have a preferred date range or a CSV of NFLX price data, you can share it and I’ll run the indicators immediately.
- Option C: If you want me to proceed with the framework now and fill in the actual readings later, I can provide the full trend narrative and a filled-out table once data is available.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch with a different date range, or proceed with Option A/B/C as described? Also, please confirm if you want me to include any other indicators (e.g., VWMA or a volatility-specific measure) in place of any from the current list. 

Markdown table: Key indicators overview (NFLX)
| Indicator | Category | Role / What it tells you | How to interpret for NFLX |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above suggests uptrend; cross below may indicate weakening; use with other signals for timing. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above/below defines major regime; crossovers with shorter averages add confluence for entries/exits. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum, quick shifts | Quick signals; use to time entries when aligned with longer-term trend. |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend-change signals | Crossover and histogram shifts indicate momentum changes; confirm with RSI and price position relative to SMAs. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold momentum | RSI > 70 overbought, < 30 oversold; look for divergences and cross-check with trend context. |
| boll_ub | Volatility / Breakouts | Upper-band breakout potential, overbought zones | Price near/above upper band may signal exhaustion or strong trend; confirm with MACD/RSI. |
| boll_lb | Volatility / Breakouts | Lower-band reversal zones, oversold context | Price near/below lower band may signal reversal or persistent down-move with volatility. |
| atr | Volatility | Current volatility level, risk sizing | Higher ATR means wider stops and larger position sizing; use for risk management. |

If you’d like, I can attempt another data fetch now and begin weaving the full, data-backed NFLX trend narrative as soon as the data comes in.
