Recommendation
- Buy AMD with a risk-managed starter, then scale in on confirming catalysts and stability in data-center demand and margins.

Rationale (aligned with the plan you provided)
- Structural tailwinds: AMD stands to benefit from multi-year AI compute demand and a diversified platform (EPYC CPUs, CDNA GPUs, ROCm software) that can capture a broad set of workloads beyond Nvidia-dominated markets.
- Margin resilience potential: Data-center mix shifts and software-enabled offerings can help support margins even if consumer GPU prices or hardware ASPs face pressures.
- Backlog and ecosystem momentum: Large hyperscaler deployments and ROCm ecosystem traction could translate into durable revenue visibility and incremental services revenue.
- Bear risks are credible and should be monitored: Nvidia leadership, ROCm adoption pace, data-center pricing/ASP pressure, node/ramp execution risks, and macro volatility could weigh on near-term performance.

Concrete implementation plan
- Starter position: Open a modest starter position now to test conviction. Size it so it fits within your overall risk budget (e.g., a small percentage of portfolio value; aim for about 1–3% of equity risk allocation, scaled to your preferences).
- Add-on triggers (scale-in conditions):
  - Sustained data-center backlog growth or improving ASP/margin trajectory.
  - Tangible ROCm ecosystem momentum (developer adoption, broader software traction).
  - Positive cadence in CDNA/EPYC product launches with favorable market reception.
- Risk controls:
  - Stop-loss framework: place a downside stop at a level that aligns with your loss tolerance (consider 8–12% below entry as an initial guardrail, adjusted for chart support levels).
  - Trailing exposure: implement a trailing stop (e.g., 15–20%) to protect gains as the trend confirms.
  - Hedging: consider protective puts or a collar around key catalysts (earnings, major product launches) to cap downside while preserving upside potential.
- Catalysts and monitoring:
  - Track data-center demand signals, hyperscaler capex trends, backlog/lead times, and ASP/margin trajectory.
  - Monitor execution around CDNA/EPYC launches and ROCm ecosystem milestones (developer adoption, interoperability milestones).
  - Have clear re-evaluation points if data-center growth slows or margins deteriorate meaningfully.
- Contingency planning:
  - If data-center demand decelerates or margins deteriorate beyond predefined thresholds, be prepared to pause adds, trim selectively, or reduce exposure while preserving downside protection.

Lessons applied
- Use a multi-signal approach and explicit risk controls to avoid overcommitting on a single narrative.
- Build in explicit triggers for scaling in or stepping back to manage execution risk and macro-driven volatility.
- Treat data gaps as uncertainty; rely on a structured plan that can be updated quickly as new data arrives.

Final note
- Given the provided bull/bear balance and the outlined risk-managed path, the position should be initiated with a cautious starter and clear rules to add on favorable catalysts while protecting against near-term shocks.
