# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD aims to win with a broader AI compute platform beyond GPUs, combining CPUs, accelerators, and software. A cautious, risk-managed buy targets multi-year growth while limiting near-term execution risk.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Buy with a risk-managed plan. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Diversified AI compute platform: AMD’s strategy spans CPUs (EPYC), accelerators (CDNA), and software (ROCm), aiming to capture a wider range of AI workloads beyond a single GPU race.
- Margin potential from mix and software: ROCm and related services can boost margins as data-center demand shifts toward higher-profit workloads, improving profitability over time.
- Durable backlog and ecosystem momentum: Large customers and a growing ROCm ecosystem provide ongoing revenue visibility and recurring services revenue.
- Manageable execution risk with a plan: A structured plan with clear milestones helps mitigate execution risk and increase the odds of upside if key catalysts materialize.

## Risks To Watch
- ROCm adoption at scale is not yet proven: The software moat may take time to translate into meaningful revenue.
- Backlog ≠ revenue certainty: Lead times, cancellations, and potential margin pressures can affect actual results.
- Software monetization is not guaranteed: Building meaningful services revenue can take longer than expected.
- Ramp and supply dynamics: Product ramps and supply conditions can surprise, underscoring the need for disciplined risk controls.
