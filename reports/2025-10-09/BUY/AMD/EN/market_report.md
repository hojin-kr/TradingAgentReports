I attempted to pull AMD data and run the indicator checks, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError. Both the price data fetch and the stockstats indicators calls failed. I can retry the data pull now, or proceed with the planned indicator framework and fill in the actual readings as soon as the data import succeeds. Please tell me which you prefer. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators (8 total) that provide complementary insights for AMD in a tech/semiconductor context and why they’re suitable.

Selected indicators (8, non-redundant)
- close_10_ema: Quick, responsive short-term momentum. Helps identify rapid shifts in price action and potential entry/exit points in a volatile stock like AMD.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Balances the fast EMA with a clearer trend view.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend confirmation. Useful for assessing macro-trend direction and for golden/death-cross context when planning strategic entries/exits.
- macd: Core momentum signal via the difference of two EMAs. Helps spot potential momentum shifts and trend changes, especially in a stock with episodic drawdowns and rallies.
- macdh: MACD histogram, showing momentum strength and divergence magnitude. Adds color to MACD cross signals, useful to gauge conviction.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Helps confirm signals from price action and trend indicators, with divergence signals as an extra filter.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-period SMA). Provides a dynamic baseline to interpret price movements relative to recent volatility; useful for identifying mean reversion and breakout tendencies in AMD.
- atr: Volatility measure. Guides risk management, stop placement, and position sizing in a stock with variable volatility like AMD, especially around product cycle news or earnings.

Rationale for the combination
- Trend + Momentum: The 10 EMA, 50 SMA, and 200 SMA give a layered view of short, medium, and long-term trend. MACD and MACD Histogram add momentum context to those trends, helping distinguish true trend moves from mere noise.
- Price vs. Volatility: ATR and Bollinger Middle together provide context on how aggressive price moves are relative to recent volatility, aiding risk management and breakout interpretation.
- Reversal Filters: RSI adds a momentum-based overbought/oversold lens with divergence considerations to catch potential mean reversions that align with trend signals.
- Complementarity and redundancy avoidance: The chosen set avoids duplicating information from closely related indicators (e.g., it excludes boll_ub/boll_lb to prevent redundancy with boll; MACD’s signal/histogram are included with MACD itself to capture both crossovers and momentum strength without duplicating the same signal types excessively).

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed trend report for AMD, including:
  - Current positioning relative to 10 EMA, 50 SMA, and 200 SMA (direction, cross signals, support/resistance contexts).
  - MACD and MACD Histogram signals (crossovers, momentum strength, potential divergences with price).
  - RSI positioning with interpretations of momentum strength and potential reversals.
  - Bollinger Middle context with price interaction (mean reversion vs. breakout cues).
  - ATR-based volatility guidance for risk management, stop placement, and position sizing.
- A concise, trader-friendly summary with actionable signals and caveats, tailored to AMD’s typical volatility and event-driven moves (earnings, product cycles, supply chain news, etc.).
- A final Markdown table at the end summarizing key points (indicators, purpose, what to watch for).

Proposed next step
- I can immediately retry fetching the data and then run the 8 indicators to generate the full, data-backed trend report. Would you like me to retry the data pull now?

Markdown table (plan overview)
| Indicator | Purpose for AMD context | What to watch for |
|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Quick momentum shifts; entry/exit timing | Price crosses above/below 10 EMA; follow-up with MACD for confirmation |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and support/resistance | Price stays above/below 50 SMA; cross with price action indicates trend strength |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend confirmation | Golden cross or death cross signals; guides strategic bias |
| macd | Momentum and potential trend changes | MACD line vs signal line cross; strength via histogram |
| macdh | Momentum magnitude and divergence cues | Histogram expansion/contraction; potential price divergence |
| rsi | Overbought/oversold context; reversals | RSI nearing extremes with or without price confirmation; look for divergences |
| boll | Baseline for price vs. volatility; mean reversion cues | Price interacting with the middle line; breakouts or mean reversion indicators |
| atr | Volatility and risk management | Rising ATR suggests larger stops; shrinking ATR may allow tighter risk controls |

If you’d like me to proceed with the retry, just say “Retry data fetch for AMD,” and I’ll run the requests again and then provide a full, data-backed analysis.
