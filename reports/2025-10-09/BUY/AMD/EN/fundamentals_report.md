Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest fundamental data for AMD (AMD) using the available tools, but the calls failed due to a system error (FileNotFoundError) when trying to run the parallel requests and also when requesting individual statements. It looks like the data environment isn’t accessible right now, so I don’t have the latest insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the latest balance sheet/cash flow/income statement to include in the report.

What would you like me to do next?

Option A: Retry now (sequentially)
- I will run the data requests one by one (not in parallel) to isolate any failures and attempt to recover the data:
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment (AMD, 2025-10-09)
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions (AMD, 2025-10-09)
  - get_simfin_balance_sheet (AMD, quarterly, 2025-10-09)
  - get_simfin_cashflow (AMD, quarterly, 2025-10-09)
  - get_simfin_income_stmt (AMD, quarterly, 2025-10-09)

Option B: Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals overview (no new data)
- I’ll provide a detailed, trader-focused narrative of AMD’s fundamentals based on publicly known context up to now, plus a structured plan for the exact data I would pull (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the latest quarterly statements). You’ll get:
  - Company profile recap
  - Revenue and earnings drivers (product mix, data center, gaming, embedded/AI initiatives)
  - Margin and cost structure commentary
  - Balance sheet positioning (liquidity, leverage, capex intensity)
  - Cash flow health (operating cash flow, free cash flow)
  - Insider sentiment and insider-trading context (high-level interpretation)
  - Key risks and catalysts
  - A Markdown table summarizing key takeaways (as requested)

Option C: Hybrid (I retry now and summarize what I can, then follow up with the data when/if it returns)
- I’ll attempt the data fetches again, and if any return data, I’ll weave that into a comprehensive report; if some calls still fail, I’ll clearly note which data is missing and provide best-effort estimates or context where appropriate.

Please tell me which option you’d prefer. If you choose A or C, I’ll start the retry immediately and deliver a full, trader-focused AMD fundamentals report (with a detailed Markdown summary table at the end) as soon as I have data. If you choose B, I’ll proceed with a thorough qualitative analysis right away.
