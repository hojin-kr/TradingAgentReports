I’m sorry — I couldn’t fetch the META data due to a data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError from get_YFin_data). It looks like there’s an environment issue accessing the Yahoo Finance CSV in this session. I can retry immediately, or try a different date range or data source if you’d like. If you prefer, you can also provide a CSV file or allow me to proceed with a best-effort, non-data-driven analysis, though that would be less precise.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) to use once data is available
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  Why: Core mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the broader trend when used with longer-term averages.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark and a common signal for major trend direction (golden/death cross context). Provides strategic trend confirmation.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  Why: Responsive short-term momentum signal to capture quick shifts and possible entry points. Works well when filtered with longer-term averages.
- macd (MACD line)
  Why: Momentum and trend-change signal via crossovers with its signal line; useful for spotting developing trends.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: Smoother signal line for crossovers with MACD; adds reliability to MACD-derived entries/exits.
- rsi (RSI)
  Why: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold cues; helps flag divergences and reversals when used with trend context.
- atr (ATR)
  Why: Volatility measure to help position sizing and risk management; sets realistic stop distances and adaptiveness to market swings.
- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  Why: Dynamic volatility benchmark based on a 20-period SMA; useful for spotting breakouts or reversions when combined with other signals.

Rationale for this combination
- This set provides a balanced view: trend direction (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum (MACD components, RSI), and volatility/risk control (ATR and Bollinger middle). By including both trend and momentum tools, you can filter false signals in META’s often volatile trading environment and align entries with the prevailing trend.
- Avoids redundancy by keeping a clear split between:
  - 3 trend/medium-to-long-term aids (50SMA, 200SMA, 10EMA)
  - 2 MACD momentum signals (MACD and MACD Signal)
  - 1 momentum oscillator (RSI)
  - 2 volatility/risk tools (ATR, Bollinger middle)

What I’ll deliver when data is available
- A detailed, nuanced trend report for META as of the current date, including:
  - Trend direction and strength across timeframes
  - MACD momentum signals and potential crossovers/divergences
  - RSI readings and any overbought/oversold nuances with trend confirmation
  - Volatility regime using ATR and Bollinger middle for context on risk management
  - Practical trading implications: potential entry/exit points, stop placement guidance, and risk considerations tailored to META
  - A concise summary table (Markdown) listing key findings and the 8 indicators with their current reading/context

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry fetching the META data now? If yes, I’ll fetch the data and then generate the full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators listed above and a final Markdown table.
- If you prefer, you can provide a CSV or allow a fallback to a cached dataset, and I’ll proceed with the detailed analysis immediately.
