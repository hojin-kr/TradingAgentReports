Thanks for the prompt. I hit a tool error fetching Reddit stock news for META on 2025-10-09. The error is an internal FileNotFoundError from the data source we use for Reddit feeds, and I can’t fix it from here. I can retry later or proceed with alternative data sources to still produce a thorough analysis.

Options to proceed:
- Option A (retry): I can retry the Reddit data fetch now or at a specific later time to gather day-by-day sentiment from Reddit threads mentioning META.
- Option B (alternative sources): I can synthesize a comprehensive long-form report using other sources I can access right now (e.g., mainstream news, press releases, market sentiment from other social platforms, and public filings) and clearly label the data as coming from non-Reddit sources.
- Option C (hybrid): I proceed with a structured report focusing on social sentiment and news from non-Reddit sources now, and I’ll append Reddit sentiment updates as soon as the Reddit tool comes back online.

If you’d like, I can go with Option B or C immediately and produce a detailed report with:
- Daily sentiment overview (derived from non-Reddit sources if you approve),
- Recent META news (past week),
- Key drivers and narratives (AI/ads, privacy/regulatory environment, monetization strategies for Reels/Threads, hardware/software initiatives),
- Potential implications for traders (short-term catalysts, risk factors, and sentiment-driven volatility),
- A final actionable section with a recommended stance (BUY/HOLD/SELL) only after we have a fuller data view you’re comfortable with.

To tailor the report, please confirm:
1) Do you want me to proceed with non-Reddit sources only for now, or retry the Reddit data as soon as possible?
2) What date range should I cover (past 7 days, past 14 days, or a custom window around 2025-10-09)?
3) Any particular angles you care about (AI features and monetization, Meta's ad revenue trends, Threads adoption, Regulation/legal risks, Metaverse/capital allocation, or something else)?

If you’re okay with it, I’ll start with a structured, in-depth analysis using public sources other than Reddit and will clearly mark any data gaps due to the current tool issue. I can also draft the Markdown table layout for the end of the report right away so we’re ready to drop in Reddit data once the tool is back.
