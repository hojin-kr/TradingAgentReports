Assessment verdict
- Based on the provided framework and current signals, META warrants a Buy stance. Commit to a staged entry with disciplined risk controls to balance conviction with potential near-term volatility.

Recommendation
- Buy META. Implement in three tranches, with clear price and catalyst-driven triggers to adjust exposure.

Rationale (condensed)
- AI-driven monetization and scalable infra should lift ARPU and lower incremental costs as volume grows.
- Multi-app data moat (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) provides a durable, defensible growth engine.
- Regulatory progress reduces tail risk and supports a constructive long-term earnings path.
- Near-term risks exist (macro ad softness, ROIC realization timing, valuation risk) but are manageable with staged entry and risk controls.

Strategic entry plan (staged)
- Tranche 1 (now): Initiate approximately 1/3 of your planned META exposure.
- Tranche 2 (2–6 weeks): Add a second tranche if near-term catalysts materialize (ARPU acceleration signals, sustained regulatory progress, or improving Reels/shopping monetization metrics). Consider deploying the second tranche upon a pullback into the roughly 730–800 range or on a clear positive data read, whichever occurs first.
- Tranche 3 (1–3 quarters): Complete the position if earnings/updates show clear ARPU uplift and sustained ad-revenue momentum; otherwise reassess at that time.

Entry level guidance (stated as ranges)
- Target add-on zones: look for pullbacks toward the mid-to-upper 700s (roughly 730–800) for the next tranche, or a decisive break above 800 with volume to confirm momentum for the final tranche.

Risk management
- Stop strategy: use a trailing stop of roughly 7–12% from your average entry price, tuned to volatility (ATR-based stops are suitable).
- Position sizing: cap single-name risk at about 2–4% of total portfolio per tranche, adjusted for your risk tolerance.
- Hedging: consider optional protection (e.g., OTM puts or a small option spread) around key catalyst windows if you have a larger overall META exposure.

Catalysts and monitoring (timing to act)
- Near-term catalysts: EU DMA settlement terms, Nigeria privacy/monetization developments, uptake of CoreWeave-like AI compute deployments, and early Reels/shopping monetization momentum.
- Quarterly cadence: reassess ARPU growth, ad revenue momentum, and margin trajectory after earnings. Decide whether to deploy the next tranche or pause.

Performance framework and exit considerations
- Bull case: sustained ARPU uplift, meaningful margin improvement from AI compute, and evidence of durable earnings power justify overweight exposure or holding for multi-quarter appreciation.
- Bear case: stalled ARPU acceleration, delayed AI ROI realization, or unfavorable regulatory terms—reassess exposure, consider trimming, hedging, or moving toward Hold/Sell if data deteriorates meaningfully over successive quarters.

Notes
- Maintain data-driven discipline: require confirmatory signals across ARPU, ad demand resilience, monetization milestones, and margin progression before expanding exposure.
- Track ROIC/FCF alongside topline growth to ensure infra investments translate into cash-flow gains.

Final assessment
- Given the synergy of AI monetization, scalable compute, and regulatory progress, a Buy with a disciplined, staged entry and risk controls is the most prudent stance right now.
