Recommendation: Buy QQQ with a disciplined, risk-managed approach.

Rationale aligned to the plan
- Bull case alignment: The mega-caps within QQQ remain advantaged by AI, cloud infrastructure, and software platforms, supported by strong balance sheets and ongoing capital discipline (buybacks, dividends). This underpins durable cash flow and potential for multiple expansion over time.
- Bear case realism: Valuation and concentration risk are real headwinds. These can be mitigated with hedging, careful position sizing, and explicit downside triggers rather than ignoring the risk.
- Structurally sensible stance: The proposed framework—modest initial exposure, staged accumulation on favorable signals, and protective hedges—offers a balanced path to participate in upside while limiting downside.

Concrete action plan (execution-oriented)
- Initial position sizing
  - Start with 25% of your planned QQQ sleeve now.
  - Build toward 40–60% of the planned exposure over the next several weeks if price action and trend signals remain constructive.
  - Increment adds on confirmations (e.g., price trading above 50-day and 200-day moving averages with positive momentum and healthy breadth, plus solid earnings cues from top holdings).

- Hedging and risk controls
  - Protective hedge: Use a hedge on the core QQQ exposure, such as buying 6–12 month out-of-the-money puts (OTM) targeting roughly 5–10% downside protection, or implement a collar (long QQQ, short a slightly OTM call, long a put at a lower strike) to reduce premium costs.
  - Hedge sizing: Keep hedged exposure at roughly 15–25% of total QQQ exposure to preserve upside while providing meaningful downside protection.
  - Stops/triggers: Establish explicit loss triggers to re-evaluate or trim if the position breaks technical support or substantial adverse macro signals emerge.

- Monitoring and triggers
  - Technicals: Favorings include price above 50-day and 200-day moving averages, constructive MACD, and improving breadth. Watch for leadership shifts among top holdings (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, etc.).
  - Fundamentals: Track free cash flow growth, buyback cadence, and balance-sheet health of megacaps; monitor AI monetization progress and enterprise AI adoption signals.
  - Macro/regulatory: Stay alert for rate trajectory changes, policy/regulatory developments, and breadth deterioration that could alter risk/reward.

- Contingency plan
  - If macro or earnings signals deteriorate meaningfully, reduce exposure, tighten hedges, or exit if downside triggers are hit.
  - If leadership broadens and breadth improves, consider adding to deltas beyond 40% exposure while maintaining hedges.

- Post-decision discipline and learning
  - Document triggers and outcomes for each addition or trim to avoid decision drift.
  - Prioritize data that matters: fundamentals (FCF growth, buybacks, balance sheets) alongside price action, not one signal in isolation.
  - Recognize ETF concentration risk: QQQ’s strength is also its risk; ensure sizing and hedges reflect the exposed mega-cap overweight.

Bottom line
- Take a constructive, risk-aware long position in QQQ. The core thesis remains intact—AI-driven growth, cloud/software leadership, and capital discipline support upside—while the explicit hedging and disciplined sizing framework guards against the main bear-case risks.
