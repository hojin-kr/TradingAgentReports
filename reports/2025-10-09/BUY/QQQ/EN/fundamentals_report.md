I’m running into a backend error right now. The parallel tool calls and a direct call to get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment both fail with: FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory. I can’t fetch insider sentiment/transactions or SimFin financial statements for QQQ at the moment.

A couple important context points about QQQ:
- QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust), not a single company. Insider sentiment and insider transactions are typically applicable to individual corporate issuers, not to an ETF in the same way. The SimFin income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow data are usually for corporations, so applying them to an ETF’s ticker can be inappropriate or unavailable.
- If we did pull data for the ETF’s sponsor or the fund itself, it would still be different from the fund’s underlying holdings’ fundamentals.

What I can do next
- Retry the data fetch in a few minutes to see if the backend issue is temporary.
- If you’d like a meaningful, trader-focused fundamental view of QQQ, pivot to ETF-focused fundamentals instead of company-level data. I can produce:
  - Fund profile: issuer (Invesco), assets under management (AUM), expense ratio, inception date.
  - Holdings view: top holdings by weight, sector allocations, geographic exposure (based on the latest disclosures).
  - Performance and risk: YTD/1Y/3Y returns (price and NAV if available), volatility measures, tracking error vs. the Nasdaq-100 index.
  - Income and distributions: dividend yield, history of distributions, payout schedule.
  - Fees and liquidity: bid-ask spread context, average daily volume, liquidity notes.
- If you specifically want corporate-level fundamentals, I can switch to analyzing Invesco or any other single issuer you specify (and I’ll fetch balance sheets, income statements, cash flows, and insider data for that issuer).

Would you like me to:
A) retry the data fetch now and continue with a company-level (issuer) analysis if available, or
B) proceed with an ETF-focused fundamental report on QQQ (fund profile, holdings, performance, and distributions) using the available ETF-oriented data and disclosures?
