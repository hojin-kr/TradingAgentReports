I tried to fetch the Reddit data for QQQ, but the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I retried with the same result. It looks like the data-fetching tool is currently not functioning on my end.

Here are your options so we can keep moving:

- Option 1: Retry now and attempt to pull Reddit data again, then build the full long-form report (social sentiment by day + recent news + implications for traders). I’ll deliver a comprehensive write-up with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option 2: Proceed with a partial report that excludes Reddit data and focuses on other available sources (public news headlines and general market sentiment around tech/QQQ) with clear labeling that Reddit data is missing.
- Option 3: Wait a bit and try again later, then deliver the full report once the tool comes back online.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, please choose Option 1 or 2. I’ll tailor the output accordingly.

In the meantime, here’s the structure I plan to deliver for the full report (once data is available). I’ll fill in each item with day-by-day sentiment and news insights, then summarize implications for traders with a clear risk/decision framework. I’ll also append a Markdown table at the end.

Proposed report structure (to be filled with data):
- Executive snapshot
  - What the last week says about public sentiment on QQQ (and by extension the tech/Nasdaq-100 ecosystem)
  - Key sentiment drivers (e.g., AI hype, mega-cap tech earnings, rate expectations)
- Data sources and methodology
  - Reddit (community sentiment by day)
  - Other social channels (if available)
  - Public news headlines and sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
  - Market context (volume, option activity, fund flows)
- Daily sentiment analysis (last 7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment score (net positive vs. negative)
  - Top themes by day (e.g., AI hype, tech earnings outlook, macro concerns)
  - Notable posts/headlines that moved sentiment
  - Any abnormal spikes (volume, engagement)
- News headlines and market impact (last 7 days)
  - Summary of major pieces (earnings comments, macro events, regulatory/tech policy chatter)
  - How headlines may influence QQQ flows and day-to-day volatility
- Thematic insights and implications for traders
  - Potential short-term catalysts (earnings cadence, Fed commentary, macro data)
  - Structural considerations (tech sector tilt, Nasdaq rebalancing, ETF flows)
  - Risk flags (sentiment exhaustion, distribution risk, implied volatility cues)
- Quantified signals and scenarios
  - If sentiment remains strongly positive, potential upside risk and price targets
  - If sentiment turns negative, downside risk and hedging ideas
  - Neutral scenario with range-bound trading and rotating leaders
- Practical trading takeaways
  - What to watch in the next 1–2 weeks
  - Suggested positions/hedges (illustrative, not financial advice)
- Appendix
  - Data limitations
  - Key headlines and posts (sample)

Markdown table (example layout to include at the end)
- Date | Net Sentiment (Pro/Con) | Top Themes | Notable Headlines/Posts | Implied Vol/Volume Signal | Trading Implication

If you want me to proceed now, tell me which option you prefer (1 or 2), and I’ll generate the full report as soon as I have the Reddit data or as soon as you authorize using the alternative approach.
