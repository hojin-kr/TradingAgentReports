Recommendation: Buy Apple (AAPL) with a disciplined, staged entry and robust risk management for a 12–24 month horizon.

Rationale (key takeaways from the plan):
- Durable growth engine: Services expansion and ecosystem moat provide recurring revenue and higher margins, helping to offset hardware-cycle volatility.
- Cash flow and capital return: Strong FCF supports buybacks and dividends, reinforcing EPS resilience during tougher periods.
- AI-enabled upside: Integrated AI features can boost engagement, subscriptions, and ARPU over time.
- Quality in risk-off regimes: A megacap with strong balance sheet and predictable cash flows tends to perform well when liquidity returns and sentiment improves.

Entry and risk discretions (how to implement):
- Entry setup: Look for price to be above the 50-day moving average with the 50-day trend upward, MACD positive, and RSI not in extreme overbought territory. If a pullback tests the breakout with constructive momentum, consider a staged buy.
- Position sizing: Core exposure 2–4% of the portfolio for AAPL, with risk-per-trade capped at 0.75–1.0% of the portfolio for the initial tranche. Add in 2–3 steps on favorable signals (volume-led breakouts, robust MACD, pullbacks to support).
- Risk controls: Use ATR-based stops (1.0x–1.5x ATR below entry). Consider hedging around key catalysts (earnings, regulatory milestones) with collars or protective puts for a portion of the position.
- Monitoring cadence: Weekly reviews around catalysts (earnings, product launches, regulatory updates), then biweekly after a few cycles. Maintain a decision log to document the thesis and data that would trigger revisions.
- Contingency playbooks:
  - If iPhone demand weakens, emphasize Services/AI monetization and potentially trim or hedge exposure.
  - If regulatory risk intensifies, rely on governance strength and consider hedges to limit downside while preserving upside if fundamentals stay intact.
  - If AI monetization misses expectations, reset expectations and avoid over-leveraging into a single variable; scale exposure to demonstrated fundamentals.
- Exit framework: Bear-case trigger could be a sustained break below key risk levels (e.g., breach of a long-term moving average with deteriorating macro signals). Bull-case accelerants include stronger Services growth, free cash flow expansion, and clear AI monetization progress prompting size increases.

What could prompt a revision:
- Macro regime shifts (higher rates, risk-off), material regulatory hurdles, or a meaningful shortfall in AI monetization could justify trimming or hedging despite the long-term thesis.

Bottom line
- Buy AAPL with a disciplined, data-driven entry and strong risk controls to participate in potential upside while protecting against downside in volatile periods.
