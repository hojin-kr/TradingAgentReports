I attempted to fetch AAPL price data for analysis, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I don’t have live data to generate real-time signals right now. If you’d like, I can retry once the data source is accessible, or proceed with a solid, diverse indicator setup you can use once data is available. In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators for AAPL that provide complementary insights and work well for a large-cap tech stock in a mixed-to-uptrending environment.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages (short-term)
  - Rationale: Captures quick momentum shifts; helps identify potential entry/exit points when price clips the 10 EMA.
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (medium-term)
  - Rationale: Defines the intermediate trend; acts as dynamic support/resistance and helps filter signals from the 10 EMA.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages (long-term)
  - Rationale: Benchmarks the overall trend; useful for confirming macro-direction (golden cross/death cross in combination with 50 SMA).
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: Core momentum signal; crossovers of MACD line vs. signal line help identify trend changes and momentum shifts.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: MACD signal line; its cross with the MACD line provides a cleaner trigger than the MACD line alone.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: MACD histogram; visualizes momentum strength and divergence; useful to confirm or question MACD cross signals.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Rationale: Overbought/oversold context; helps spot potential reversals when paired with price trends and MACD.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Rationale: Measures market volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing, especially around breakouts or rapid moves.

Why this mix is suitable (nuanced view)
- Trend context with multiple horizons: The 10 EMA, 50 SMA, and 200 SMA provide a layered view of short-, medium-, and long-term trends. For AAPL, this helps distinguish genuine trend momentum from pullbacks or range-bound moves typical in large-cap tech.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD trio (macd, macds, macdh) gives a more robust sense of momentum changes than a single MACD line. Crossovers + histogram trends can help reduce false signals in choppy markets.
- Divergence and strength: RSI informs potential reversal points and helps avoid entering long when the stock is in overbought territory despite strong price scans. If RSI divergences occur (e.g., price making higher highs while RSI stalls), it’s a cautionary signal that can be confirmed with MACD/price trend.
- Risk management: ATR adds a practical layer for setting stops and sizing positions under evolving volatility. This is especially useful around earnings announcements or macro news that can spike volatility.

What to watch and how to use them together (practical guidelines)
- Trend confirmation: Look for price trading above 200 SMA, with 50 SMA trending upward and price above 50 SMA. A pullback toward the 50 or 200 SMA should be evaluated with MACD and RSI for a potential bounce or break.
- Momentum entry/exit: When macd crosses above the signal line and the histogram turns positive, consider long entries if price is also above 50 SMA and RSI is not overbought. For exits, watch for MACD turning down, histogram shrinking, or RSI failing to rise above previous highs.
- Breakouts and volatility: If price breaks above recent highs with RSI not yet overbought and ATR rising, a breakout setup may be stronger and safer with a stop based on ATR-derived distance.
- Risk management framework: Use ATR to set stop losses at a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR below entry for longs) and adjust position size to target risk per trade.

Next steps
- I can re-run data retrieval as soon as the data source is accessible on your end or I can proceed with the indicator framework above once I have fresh price data for AAPL.
- If you want a different emphasis (e.g., more emphasis on volatility or more on trend), I can swap in other indicators from the provided list (e.g., include boll_ub and boll_lb or VWMA) while keeping the total to 8 indicators.

Key points table
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Category: Moving Averages (short-term) | Purpose: Capture quick momentum shifts; use for early entries/filters | Signals: Price crosses above/below 10 EMA; cross with 50 SMA adds confirmation
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Category: Moving Averages (medium-term) | Purpose: Define intermediate trend; acts as dynamic support/resistance | Signals: Price above/below 50 SMA; 10 EMA crossing 50 SMA for momentum cues
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Category: Moving Averages (long-term) | Purpose: Confirm macro trend; trend-filter for entries | Signals: Price above 200 SMA indicates bullish backdrop; golden/death cross with 50SMA as a longer-term signal
- Indicator: macd | Category: MACD Related | Purpose: Core momentum signal | Signals: MACD line crossing signal line; positive/negative momentum shifts
- Indicator: macds | Category: MACD Related | Purpose: MACD signal line cross filter | Signals: Crossover of MACD with MACDS for entry/exit triggers
- Indicator: macdh | Category: MACD Related | Purpose: Momentum strength and divergence | Signals: Increasing histogram supports up-moves; divergence warns of potential reversals
- Indicator: rsi | Category: Momentum Indicators | Purpose: Overbought/oversold context | Signals: RSI > 70 overbought, RSI < 30 oversold; check for divergences with price
- Indicator: atr | Category: Volatility Indicators | Purpose: Risk management and stop placement | Signals: Rising ATR indicates higher volatility; adjust stops/position size accordingly

Notes
- Data retrieval is currently blocked on my end due to a FileNotFoundError. If you’d like, I can retry immediately, or you can provide a fresh data feed or a specific date range to target.
- Once data is available, I can generate a live indicator table with current values and send a detailed trend synthesis for AAPL, including potential entry/exit scenarios based on the 8-indicator framework above.

Would you like me to retry data retrieval now, or would you prefer I proceed with any adjustments to the indicator set or the time horizon (e.g., intraday vs. daily)?
