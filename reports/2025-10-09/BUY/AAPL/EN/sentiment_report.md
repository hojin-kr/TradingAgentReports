Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch Reddit stock data for AAPL on 2025-10-09, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry once more later, but in the meantime I don’t want to stall your analysis. Here’s how I propose to proceed and what I can deliver right now, plus what I’ll deliver once the data fetch works.

What happened
- Attempted tool call: get_reddit_stock_info with ticker=AAPL and curr_date=2025-10-09
- Result: FileNotFoundError (tool-side issue)
- Next step: I can retry the fetch now or switch to other data sources if you’d like. If you’re OK with it, I’ll proceed as soon as the Reddit tool returns data.

Proposed approach (what I will deliver once data is available)
- Comprehensive long-form analysis focused on AAPL, covering the past week of social media chatter, sentiment trends, and recent company news.
- Key components:
  - Executive snapshot: summary of sentiment signals, notable events, and potential implications for traders.
  - Daily sentiment heatmap: a day-by-day view of sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with intensity notes.
  - Top themes and posts: recurring topics (e.g., product news, services growth, supply chain, earnings expectations), and how influential posts shape sentiment.
  - News roundup: brief synthesis of major news (earnings, product launches, regulatory updates, M&A chatter) and how it’s being received on social channels.
  - Risk and catalyst analysis: what could flip sentiment (e.g., a surprise product event, guidance change), and potential downside/upside catalysts.
  - Implications for traders: short-term moves around sentiment shifts, longer-term trends, options activity signals, and positioning cues.
  - Data caveats: limitations of sentiment signals, potential manipulation, sample biases, and time-lag considerations.
  - Methodology note: how sentiment is computed, sources used, and any filters applied.

Preliminary report structure you can expect
- Situational overview of AAPL’s market context (as of the latest data)
- Sentiment trends by day (with visuals if needed)
- Thematic analysis (What people are talking about and why it matters)
- News & events impact assessment
- Trader-oriented takeaways and risk management notes
- Shortcomings and data quality notes
- Markdown summary table (see below)

What I need from you to proceed smoothly
- If you’d like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, I’ll run the tool again immediately and then generate the full report with actual figures and themes.
- Alternatively, if you prefer, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative write-up based on known patterns for AAPL and publicly available news sentiment (without the Reddit-specific data) and clearly label it as qualitative until the Reddit data comes back. This would be less precise but still useful for framing trades or risk.

Proposed next steps
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now and deliver the complete report with daily sentiment, key posts, and updated news signals once the tool succeeds.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, data-agnostic analysis for now, with the caveat that it won’t include the Reddit post-level breakdown until the tool is functioning.

Makrdown table (to be appended at the end of the final report)
- The table below is a structural placeholder. It will be populated with actual values once data is retrieved.

| Section | What to look for | Key indicators / metrics (to fill in) | Actionable trader takeaways (tentative) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Executive snapshot | Overall sentiment tone over the past week | Net sentiment score, daily highs/lows, notable sentiment spikes | Quick read on whether sentiment is turning risk-off or risk-on |
| Daily sentiment heatmap | Day-by-day sentiment distribution | Positive/neutral/negative counts per day, intensity | Identify turning points and potential entry/exit windows |
| Top themes & posts | Recurring topics driving sentiment | Most mentioned topics, sentiment per theme, influential accounts | Gauge primary catalysts; prepare for watchlist adjustments |
| News & events | Major news impact on sentiment | News counts, sentiment shift after headlines | Assess whether news supports or contradicts market moves |
| Risk & catalysts | Potential shocks | Probability estimates for catalysts, sentiment reaction ranges | Prepare hedges or adjust size around catalysts |
| Trader implications | Short-term vs. long-term implications | Implied volatility hints, sentiment vs. price moves | Entry timing, risk management, position sizing cues |
| Data caveats | Limitations of the dataset | Source biases, sampling windows, lag effects | Treat signals as directional hints, not guarantees |
| Methodology | How data was gathered & processed | Sources, filters, scoring method | Ensure transparency and reproducibility |

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now and produce the full report once the tool returns data.
- Or proceed with a qualitative framework now and fill in Reddit data once the tool is operational.

I’m ready to run with whichever option you prefer.
