Sorry about that — I hit an internal error retrieving the Reddit data for NVDA on 2025-10-09 (FileNotFoundError). I can retry now, or switch to an alternative data source if you prefer. Here are your options and what I’ll do next:

What I can do now
- Retry fetching NVDA Reddit stock data for 2025-10-09 as soon as the tool is back online.
- If you’d rather, proceed with a qualitative analysis using other public sources (non-Reddit) once available, and I’ll incorporate those signals into a comprehensive sentiment and news synthesis.

What I’ll deliver once data fetch works
- A detailed, trader-focused long report analyzing:
  - Social sentiment: daily sentiment trend for the past week from Reddit posts mentioning NVDA, including headline drivers, notable spikes, and confidence levels.
  - Key Reddit threads and themes: risk/optimism around AI demand, supply chain, product roadmap, earnings expectations, and competitive dynamics.
  - Company/news context: recent Nvidia announcements, earnings cadence, product launches, AI market developments, regulatory or geopolitical factors that could impact demand or supply.
  - Sentiment vs. price action: correlation between Reddit sentiment swings and intraday/closing price moves, with potential entry/exit cues.
  - Risk factors and implications for traders: what sentiment signals could imply (e.g., bullish euphoria vs. fading enthusiasm), and how to position around catalysts.
- A clear, easy-to-scan summary with actionable takeaways for traders, plus a Markdown table at the end to organize key points.

Next steps
- Please tell me:
  - Should I retry fetching the Reddit data immediately, or would you prefer I switch to a backup data approach first?
  - If you want, I can also compile a parallel report using available public news headlines and Nvidia press releases once I can access a broader data feed.

I’m ready to proceed with the retry as soon as you confirm.
