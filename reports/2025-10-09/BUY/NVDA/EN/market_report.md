Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch NVDA data and generate indicator reports, but the data retrieval tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I’ll outline the plan and the indicator framework I’ll use once data is accessible, and I’ll provide a detailed rationale you can use in the meantime. If you’d like, I can retry automatically or you can confirm to retry now.

What happened
- Data retrieval issue: get_YFin_data returned FileNotFoundError. This looks like an internal data source/config issue rather than a user input error. I can retry or switch to proceeding with the indicator framework and fill in the results once data is available.

Recommended indicator suite for NVDA (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming medium-term trend and for filtering signals from faster indicators.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark and check for golden/death cross contexts. Helps with strategic trend confirmation.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Responsive short-term momentum signal. Captures quick shifts and helps with timely entries when used with longer-term averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum and potential trend-change signals via crossovers/divergence. Best used with other filters in low-volatility scenarios.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoothing, paired with MACD line crossovers to trigger signals; reduces false positives when used with trend context.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength and divergence visualization; good for spotting early momentum shifts, particularly in fast markets when combined with other indicators.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold levels and potential divergences; provides a different momentum lens than MACD and helps spot reversals in trending markets.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility to inform risk management (stop placement, position sizing). Reactive but essential for adapting risk to current market conditions, especially for NVDA’s characteristic volatility.

Rationale for NVDA context (as of 2025-10-09)
- NVDA is typically a high-volatility tech/AI-centric name with pronounced trend moves around earnings, AI demand news, and policy/semiconductor cycles.
- A blend of trend (50/200 SMA), momentum (MACD family and RSI), and volatility/risk (ATR) provides both directional conviction and prudent risk controls.
- The proposed set avoids redundancy (e.g., does not include stochastic RSI or multiple Bollinger components) while still delivering robust, multi-faceted insights: trend health, momentum strength, potential reversals, and risk management.

What I’ll deliver once data is accessible
- A detailed trend report for NVDA over the latest available window, including:
  - Trend direction and strength (short-, medium-, and long-term) using SMA/EMA crossovers and alignment.
  - Momentum shifts and potential entry/exit signals from MACD family and RSI, with interpretation in context of the prevailing trend.
  - Volatility and risk considerations from ATR to guide position sizing and stop placement.
  - A concise set of actionable observations (e.g., confirm trend with SMA alignment, watch for MACD crossovers near key SMA levels, RSI divergence signals, etc.).
- A summary table (Markdown) at the end, organizing key points for quick reference.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch (get_YFin_data) immediately and then generate the indicator reports for NVDA. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry now and, once successful, provide the full trend/momentum/volatility analysis with the 8 indicators.
  - Or proceed with the framework now and fill in the actual values as soon as data retrieval succeeds.

Proposed final output structure (once data is in)
- Overview: NVDA market context and current price action summary.
- Indicator-derived insights (bulletized by each indicator, with observed signals and recommended actions).
- Integrated view: how the indicators align (e.g., price above 50 SMA but below 200 SMA with MACD showing bullish momentum, etc.).
- Risk notes: ATR-based stop guidance and potential exposure given current volatility.
- Actionable takeaways and caveats.

Markdown table: key points overview
- Indicator | What it measures | Why for NVDA | How to use signals
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Helps confirm mid-term trend and filter signals | Use with crossovers/price crossing to gauge entry/exit
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms overarching trend context (golden/death cross potential) | Align entries with long-term trend direction
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Captures quick shifts in momentum | Watch for price/EMA crossovers in choppy markets
- macd | Momentum, trend-change potential | Quick signal of momentum shifts | Look for MACD line cross with signal line; confirm with price action
- macds | MACD signal line | Smoothing of MACD, reduces noise | Crossovers with MACD line trigger signals; confirm with trend
- macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength and divergence visual | Expanding histogram supports strength; contracting suggests weakness
- rsi | Relative momentum | Overbought/oversold level and divergences | >70/<30 thresholds; watch for bullish/bearish divergences within trend
- atr | Volatility magnitude | Risk management and position sizing | Use to set stops; increase/decrease risk based on recent volatility

Apology and next step
- I’m ready to retry the data fetch now and deliver the full, data-backed NVDA analysis with the eight indicators above. Please tell me if you’d like me to attempt the fetch again automatically, and I’ll report back with the computed indicators and a detailed trend narrative as soon as the data is available.
