I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for PLTR on 2025-09-22, but the Reddit data tool returned a backend FileNotFoundError. It looks like a temporary service issue on the tool side, not something you did.

What would you like to do next?
- Retry now: I can immediately retry the Reddit data fetch and then proceed with the full sentiment/news report if it succeeds.
- Switch sources: I can proceed with a comprehensive report using non-Reddit sources (e.g., general news headlines, press releases, company filings, and visible social sentiment if you have access to another feed).
- Wait and proceed after a retry: I can summarize the approach, data expectations, and what traders should watch, so we’re ready to incorporate the Reddit findings as soon as the tool is back.

If you prefer, I can start drafting the long-form analysis framework now (without the Reddit data) so you’ll have a ready-to-fill report once the data comes in. Here’s the structure I’ll follow (and will fill in with actual data when available):

- Executive snapshot: current sentiment trend, notable catalysts from the past week.
- Social sentiment overview: daily sentiment breakdown (positive/neutral/negative), key themes (e.g., AI product wins, government contracts, valuation concerns, execution risk).
- News and headlines: summary of the week’s major PLTR news, with potential impact on sentiment and price action.
- Market reaction signals: implied volatility hints, options activity if available, any notable volume spikes.
- Catalysts and risks: near-term events (earnings cadence, major partnerships, regulatory updates) and downside/upside risks.
- Trader takeaways: actionable insights for traders (short-term swing angles, risk management notes, scenarios).
- Quick-hit data table: a Markdown table organizing the above points for easy reference.

If you want me to proceed with a retry right away, say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt the Reddit feed again and continue with the full report as soon as it returns.
