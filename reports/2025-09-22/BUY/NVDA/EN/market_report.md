Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch NVDA data for 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-22 but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can proceed with a plan and the most relevant indicator set once the data service is back online. In the meantime, here is a concise, trader-focused setup tailored for NVDA, plus why these indicators fit a volatile, high-velocity stock in the AI/semiconductor space.

Recommended 8 indicators (diverse, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance in the medium term.
  - How to use: Look for price staying above/below the 50 SMA for trend bias. Use as a baseline with faster signals to time entries.

- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and major regime context (golden/death cross signals).
  - How to use: Price above the 200 SMA suggests a longer-term uptrend; crossovers with the 50 SMA (golden/death crosses) can inform strategic bias.

- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum and potential near-term entry points.
  - How to use: Use as a leading indicator for quick shifts; confirm signals with longer-term averages to filter noise.

- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals via EMA differences.
  - How to use: Watch for MACD line crossovers (MACD vs. price action) and cross with zero line for potential entry/exit cues; use with other filters in high-volatility periods.

- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: MACD signal line cross, smoothing of momentum signals.
  - How to use: Crossovers of MACD with MACDS provide additional confirmation; avoid relying on MACD alone.

- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: MACD histogram shows momentum strength and divergence hints.
  - How to use: Expanding histogram supports momentum; shrinking/negative histogram can precede reversals; use with price action and RSI.

- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Purpose: Momentum magnitude and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: Watch for extreme readings (e.g., overbought near 70+ or oversold near 30–) and divergences with price; in strong uptrends RSI can stay high—balance with trend context.

- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Purpose: Measure of current volatility to inform risk management and stop placement.
  - How to use: Use ATR to set dynamic stops and position sizing; higher ATR means wider stops, which helps avoid premature exits in volatile moves.

Rationale for NVDA context
- NVDA often experiences strong momentum bursts tied to AI/machine-learning demand and tech sector cycles. A combination of trend (50/200 SMA), momentum (MACD, MACD signal, MACD histogram, RSI), and volatility (ATR) provides a balanced view: trend direction, timing signals, and risk controls.
- The chosen set avoids redundancy (e.g., no StochRSI here) while delivering complementary perspectives: medium-to-long-term trend, near-term momentum, and volatility-informed risk management.

What I need to proceed
- The data fetch service needs to be available again to generate the actual indicator values, perform a live trend scan, and deliver a nuanced trend report with recent-date signals.
- If you’d like, I can retry fetching NVDA data now, or you can specify a narrower date window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to reduce data load and improve chances of success.

Proposed next steps
- Option A: Retry data fetch now (NVDA, 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-22) and then generate the indicator readings and a detailed trend report.
- Option B: Narrow the date range (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-03-01) to get a quick snapshot and then expand.
- Option C: Use a different ticker with a similar risk profile if you want a quick cross-check while NVDA data is being resolved.

Key points at a glance (table)
| Indicator | Category | Purpose | How to use (quick take) |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Trend bias when price stays above/below; confirm with faster signals |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Look for price above 200 SMA for uptrend; golden/death cross signals for longer-term bets |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Use for entry timing; confirm with longer averages to filter noise |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum; trend-change signals | Crossover and zero-line signals; confirm with price/action |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal smoothing | Cross with MACD for clearer entries; avoid false positives with other filters |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength; divergence hints | Expanding histogram supports momentum; watch divergences with price |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold; momentum magnitude | Divergence checks; in strong trends RSI can stay elevated—use with trend context |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility; risk management | Dynamic stops and sizing; higher ATR implies wider stops in NVDA’s moves |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now and then produce a full, data-backed trend report with the 8 indicators, plus an actionable set of entry/exit ideas based on NVDA’s latest data. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.
