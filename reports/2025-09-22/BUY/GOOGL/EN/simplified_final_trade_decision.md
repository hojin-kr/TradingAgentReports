## Investment Decision
BUY. Confidence level: Medium-High.
Adopt a hedged, staged entry to participate in AI monetization gains while guarding against near-term headwinds.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- AI monetization across ads, YouTube, and Google Cloud offers multiple paths to higher revenue.
