Sorry — I hit an internal error with the Reddit stock info tool (FileNotFoundError). I can’t fetch the Reddit-based sentiment data for GOOGL right now. Here are my options to move forward:

What would you like me to do?
- Retry fetching Reddit data now (may succeed on a subsequent attempt).
- Retry after a short wait (e.g., a few minutes) and then continue with the full analysis.
- Proceed with a comprehensive analysis using only non-Reddit sources (e.g., recent Alphabet news and general public sentiment from other channels) and add a note that Reddit data will be integrated as soon as the tool is available.
- If you have alternative sources you want included (e.g., specific Twitter/X feeds, stock community forums), tell me and I’ll incorporate them as possible.

If you prefer, I can prepare a detailed framework for the report now and populate it fully once Reddit data is accessible. The framework would include:
- Executive snapshot of social sentiment for the past week
- Daily sentiment breakdown for GOOGL
- Top themes driving sentiment (AI, ads, regulatory, cloud, earnings commentary, product updates)
- Notable news items this week
- Potential trading implications and risk factors
- A concluding table summarizing key points (ready to convert to a Markdown table)

Please tell me which option you’d like, and I’ll proceed accordingly. If you want, I can also try the Reddit fetch again immediately.
