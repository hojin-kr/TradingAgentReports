Decision: Buy GOOGL.

Rationale (concise, aligned with the plan you provided)
- AI-driven monetization thesis is durable: Ads (Search, YouTube), YouTube engagement, Android ecosystem, and Google Cloud collectively support multi-year revenue and margin expansion as AI-enabled products scale.
- Moat and defensibility remain broad and widening: Data network effects from Chrome/Android/Search and an embedded AI stack create a durable competitive edge.
- Near-term catalysts exist, with manageable risk: Cloud backlog expansion, improving ad monetization signals, and regulatory developments that are moving toward clearer remediation paths rather than terminal risk.
- Balance sheet and capital allocation: Strong cash generation supports ongoing AI investment and optional buybacks, reducing equity risk relative to growth expectations.

Execution plan (practical, hedged, staged)
- Stage-entry (risk-managed): Initiate with 40-50% of intended long exposure now. Add a second tranche (25-40%) if AI monetization signals stay constructive (cloud backlog growth, ad ARPU signals) and regulatory clarity remains positive.
- Hedging strategy (to protect against near-term headwinds):
  - Collar approach: Buy GOOGL shares, buy a protective put near a 230-240 floor, and finance with a sold call near 290-300. This caps upside somewhat but reduces downside risk while preserving potential upside.
  - Alternative for more straightforward risk control: Use long-dated puts (LEAPs) near 200-230 to cap downside regardless of near-term price swings.
- Price targets and monitoring:
  - Base-case target: 270-290 over the next 6-12 months as monetization progress shows up in cloud profitability and ad efficiency.
  - Upside scenario: 320-340 if AI monetization accelerates and regulatory outcomes are constructive.
  - Downside risk: Sub-230 if regulatory headwinds crystallize or monetization slows meaningfully.
  - Key indicators to watch: cloud backlog profitability, ad revenue growth/ARPU, AI product monetization signals, regulatory developments, insider signals, and quarterly readings.
- Exit and risk-management rules:
  - If price trends sustainably above 290 with robust monetization data and clear regulatory progress, consider profit-taking or trimming into strength.
  - If weekly closes fall below 230-235 and thesis deteriorates (persistent monetization headwinds or worsening regulatory impact), reduce exposure or exit.
  - Reassess quarterly; scale up on stronger-than-expected monetization, scale down on continued headwinds.
- Operational readiness:
  - Maintain the eight-indicator readout (SMA50/SMA200, EMA10, MACD, MACD signal, RSI, ATR, VWMA) to guide decisions. If data access falters, rely on price action and fundamentals within the hedged framework.
- Lessons applied:
  - Avoid chasing hype; require concrete monetization progress.
  - Use hedges and staged entries to manage risk while preserving upside.
  - Predefine exits and risk limits to prevent emotionally driven decisions.
  - Be prepared for data issues and adjust the decision framework accordingly.

Bottom line
The strongest, most credible view is to take a measured, hedged long exposure to GOOGL now, with a staged entry and a collar or LEAP protection to manage downside while retaining upside potential from AI-enabled monetization. This aligns with a multi-quarter, multi-product AI growth thesis and a robust financial position, while addressing near-term regulatory and monetization timing risks.
