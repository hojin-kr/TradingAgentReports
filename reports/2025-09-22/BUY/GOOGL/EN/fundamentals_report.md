I attempted to fetch the required fundamental data for GOOGL (Alphabet) but the data retrieval tools are returning internal errors (FileNotFoundError). Both the parallel batch request and the individual calls failed. I can retry your data pulls now, or you can let me know to retry later. In the meantime, here is how I would proceed and a structured template for the full report so you can see exactly what will be included once the data is available.

What happened
- Tools used: Insider sentiment (Finnhub), insider transactions (Finnhub), and SimFin balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow (quarterly).
- Result: All attempts returned FileNotFoundError, indicating an internal data access/file path issue on the backend.
- Ticker: GOOGL (Alphabet Inc.)
- Date context: 2025-09-22

Next steps (options)
- Option A: Retry now. I will re-run the same data pulls (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly SimFin statements) and then synthesize a comprehensive report.
- Option B: If retries fail again, I can:
  - Switch to alternative data sources you approve (e.g., other public filings or your own data extracts), or
  - Provide a structured framework with placeholders and fill in once data is accessible.

Would you like me to retry the data pulls now (Option A)? If yes, I’ll run the same set of calls again and then deliver the full, detailed report with the appended Markdown table as described. If you’d prefer to proceed with a placeholder/template now (Option B), I can generate the full report structure and fill in once data becomes available.
