I attempted to pull the data for GOOGL and compute the requested indicators, but I ran into a tool execution error (FileNotFoundError) when calling the data fetch and indicators in parallel. I can retry immediately, or you can allow me to proceed with the analysis based on a retryed data pull. In the meantime, here’s a robust, complementary set of indicators I’d use for GOOGL and why they fit well together for a typical large-cap tech stock context around late Sep 2025.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Why these indicators are suitable for GOOGL (diverse, complementary insights)
- close_50_sma (medium-term trend)
  - Helps identify the ongoing trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming mid-term sentiment and filtering entries when combined with faster momentum signals.
- close_200_sma (long-term trend)
  - Establishes the broader regime (bullish/bearish). A cross of price above/below the 200 SMA or a cross with the 50 SMA offers a sense of longer-term trend health and potential major swing points.
- close_10_ema (short-term momentum)
  - Captures quick shifts in price action, providing timely signals that can prompt faster entries or exits when the market moves briskly.
- macd (momentum/trend crossovers)
  - Core momentum indicator that highlights trend changes via MACD line vs. signal line crossovers and divergence. Works well in conjunction with trend assessments from the SMAs.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Smoothing of MACD; the cross of MACD with MACDS can help reduce false signals and confirm momentum shifts when used with other filters.
- rsi (momentum strength / overbought-oversold)
  - Signals potential reversals or continuations when prices extend into overbought/oversold zones. Important to pair with trend context (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA) to avoid counter-trend trades in strong trends.
- atr (volatility / risk management)
  - Assesses current volatility, guiding position sizing and stop placement. High ATR can indicate larger price swings (higher risk), while low ATR suggests tighter ranges and tighter stops.
- vwma (volume-weighted trend confirmation)
  - Adds a volume dimension to price-driven signals, helping confirm moves that have solid participation rather than price moves on light volume.

How to interpret signals once the data is available (practical workflow)
- Trend confirmation
  - Price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with 50 SMA above 200 SMA, supports a bullish context.
  - If price is below both SMAs or if 50 SMA is below 200 SMA, be cautious about long entries; look for a potential reversal or consolidation breakout signals.
- Momentum confirmation
  - MACD line crossing above its signal line in a bullish context strengthens a long-side bias; a cross below in a bearish context reinforces downside.
  - RSI drifting toward the 50-70 range generally supports a move with room; approaching overbought (>70) in uptrends warrants monitoring for a pullback; approaching oversold (<30) in downtrends warrants caution for quick bounces that may be failed rallies.
- Volatility and risk controls
  - Rising ATR suggests increasing risk; adjust stops and position sizes accordingly.
  - Use ATR-based stop placement to keep risk consistent as volatility shifts.
- Volume validation
  - VWMA alignment with price moves (price above VWMA on rising volume) adds confidence that the move is backed by participation.
  - Divergence between price action and VWMA/volume trends can warn of weakening momentum even if price prints new highs.

Next steps
- I can retry pulling the data and computing these 8 indicators now and then deliver a detailed, data-backed report including:
  - Current price relative to the 50/200 SMAs and the implied trend
  - MACD/MACD Signal cross status and histogram
  - RSI level and potential divergence checks
  - ATR level for current volatility and appropriate risk metrics
  - VWMA confirmation versus plain MA signals
  - Any notable price action clues (breakouts, pullbacks, or pullback retracements) aligned with the indicators
- Alternatively, if you have a CSV or a snapshot of the latest data for GOOGL, you can share it and I’ll generate the indicator readings and interpretation immediately.

Status note
- Data retrieval tool calls to fetch GOOGL data and compute the 8 indicators encountered a FileNotFoundError. I’m ready to retry immediately or proceed once you approve. If you’d like, I can attempt the data fetch again now and return with a fully populated, numeric report and an updated trend assessment.
