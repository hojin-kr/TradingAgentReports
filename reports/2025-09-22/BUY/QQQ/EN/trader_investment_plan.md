Recommendation: Buy QQQ with a disciplined, risk-managed approach based on the plan provided.

Rationale (why this aligns with the plan)
- Durable growth thesis remains intact: Megacaps exposed to AI-driven software, cloud infrastructure, and data platforms offer durable cash flows, buyback potential, and balance-sheet strength.
- Quality-first risk controls: Strong balance sheets and diversified revenue streams within the megacaps reduce idiosyncratic risk vs. narrow tech bets. Macro backdrop a potential tailwind if disinflation and policy clarity persist.
- Manageable risk given planned hedges: The plan’s hedging framework (puts or collars), defined drawdown thresholds, and a staged entry help mitigate downside while preserving upside if breadth expands.

Actionable implementation (as per the plan)
- Core position: Initiate with 8% of the equity sleeve allocated to QQQ.
- Laddered entry: Deploy over 6–8 weeks (e.g., 50% today, remaining 50% in equal installments on 2–4% price declines or on a set schedule if volatility persists).
- Triggers to monitor: 
  - Price trend: keep price above a rising 50-day and 200-day moving average; use MACD/RSI context to gauge momentum.
  - Drawdown: be prepared to trim/hedge if QQQ declines more than 5% from the current level without a broad-market rationale; consider adds on strength if new highs hold.
- Hedging overlay: Implement a modest hedge (protective puts 6–12 months out, 5–10% OTM or a collar) to protect against sharp downside while allowing participation in upside.
- Risk limits: Enforce a quarterly drawdown check (e.g., 12–15% from entry) triggering review and potential hedging or resizing.
- Review cadence: Quarterly rebalancing with proactive adjustments for macro shifts, earnings trajectories of top holdings, and breadth signals.
- Operational discipline: Dollar-cost averaging for entry, minimize turnover, and consider tax-efficient placements.

Contingencies
- If breadth remains narrow or macro risk intensifies, be prepared to trim exposure or shift to hedged, more diversified tech exposure rather than pure QQQ long.
- If AI/cloud adoption accelerates and breadth broadens, modestly increase exposure in subsequent quarters within risk controls.

Final note
- The proposed rationale supports a Buy stance with a structured, risk-aware execution plan that emphasizes durability, quality, and prudent hedging. If you want, I can tailor the exact hedging instruments, strike selections, or the precise laddering schedule to your specific risk tolerance and portfolio constraints.
