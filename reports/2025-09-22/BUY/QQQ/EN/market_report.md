I attempted to fetch the data and compute the indicators for QQQ (2024-09-22 to 2025-09-22) and then run the requested indicators, but the environment returned file-not-found errors across all indicator calls. It looks like a tooling/config issue rather than a data issue. I can retry in a moment, or switch to a smaller window (e.g., last 90 days) or a single indicator to verify the setup. If you’d like, I can proceed with one of these options:
- Retry with a shorter date range (e.g., last 3–6 months)
- Retry with only a subset of indicators first (to confirm the pipeline)
- Proceed with a qualitative framework now while I re-run the data fetch in the background

In the meantime, I’ll propose a clean, non-redundant indicator suite for QQQ and why it’s suitable for a typical market context like the NASDAQ-100/QQQ environment. Once data retrieval succeeds, I’ll deliver a detailed, data-driven trends report plus a compact Markdown table of key takeaways.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average)
  - Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify the ongoing trend context for QQQ and filters noise when paired with faster signals.
- close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average)
  - Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming secular trend direction and spotting golden/death cross setups when combined with shorter-term signals.
- close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average)
  - Why: Responsive momentum proxy. Captures quick shifts in price dynamics and potential entries, useful for timing in a trending or mildly ranged market when used with longer-term filters.
- macd (MACD line)
  - Why: Core momentum signal. Crossovers with the signal line and histogram dynamics help identify trend changes and momentum shifts.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Why: Smoother confirmation of MACD-driven signals. Helps reduce false positives when used with the MACD line.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Why: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence tendencies. Adds nuance to MACD interpretation, especially in fast-moving phases.
- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - Why: Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals or divergences in context with the trend.
- atr (Average True Range)
  - Why: Volatility gauge for risk management. Helps set stop levels and gauge current market volatility, which informs position sizing and exits.

What I’ll deliver once data is retrieved
- A detailed, nuanced narrative of QQQ’s trend and momentum
  - Trend regime (bullish/bearish/sideways) as shown by price with the 50/200 SMAs
  - Momentum shifts (MACD/RSI) and any bullish/bearish divergences
  - Volatility context (ATR) to inform stop placement and risk controls
  - Price-location relative to the 10 EMA and SMA levels to assess timing and potential pullbacks or breakouts
  - Any meaningful crossovers (MACD, SMA crossovers) and RSI extremes that align with or contradict the trend
- A concise, actionable interpretation that includes potential entry/exit ideas conditioned on market context
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference

Proposed next steps
1) I retry data retrieval and indicator calculations (ideally with a smaller window to ensure the pipeline works).
2) If you prefer, I can run with a more recent window (e.g., last 90 days) or a shorter look-back for the indicators to speed up validation.
3) After successful data retrieval, I’ll present:
   - A full, granular trend/momentum report
   - The 8-indicator synthesis with non-redundant insights
   - A final Markdown table summarizing key takeaways

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry with a shorter date range (specify days, e.g., last 90 days)
- Retry with a smaller subset of indicators first (which ones would you like to start with?)
- Proceed with the qualitative framework now (no fresh data)

And once we’re back online, I’ll deliver the full, data-backed report for QQQ. Below is the proposed reference table structure I’ll finish with, once data is available.

Markdown table (structure to be filled with actual findings)
- Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret for QQQ
- close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance | [ Interpretation once data is in ]
- close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend confirmation | [ Interpretation once data is in ]
- close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum / quick shifts | [ Interpretation once data is in ]
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum crossovers and trend changes | [ Interpretation once data is in ]
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line crossovers as confirmation | [ Interpretation once data is in ]
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergence signal | [ Interpretation once data is in ]
- rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold and divergences | [ Interpretation once data is in ]
- atr | Volatility | Volatility regime and risk management cues | [ Interpretation once data is in ]

Would you like me to retry with a specific option (shorter window or subset of indicators), or should I proceed with the full retry now using a default short window?
