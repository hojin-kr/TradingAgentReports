I ran the Reddit data tool for QQQ (2025-09-22) but it returned a FileNotFoundError, so I couldn’t fetch the latest Reddit sentiment data right now. Here’s what happened and how we can proceed.

What happened
- Tool error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) when requesting get_reddit_stock_info with ticker=QQQ and curr_date=2025-09-22.
- Likely a backend/config issue with the tool rather than your query.

How you can proceed
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data pull now (may resolve if the backend is restored).
- Option B: I proceed with a structured framework and fill in the sentiment and news once the data tool returns data, or you provide alternate data sources.
- Option C: You provide any available sentiment data you’ve already collected, and I’ll analyze that immediately.

Proposed plan if we proceed now (framework you’ll get once data comes in)
- Objective: Deliver a comprehensive, trader-focused analysis of QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF) using social media sentiment (primarily Reddit), recent news, and macro context over the past week leading up to 2025-09-22.
- What will be in the final report:
  - Executive summary: Net sentiment, notable shifts, and the implied risk/reward for a 1–4 week horizon.
  - Sentiment analysis by day: Positive vs negative sentiment counts, notable spikes, and any correlation with price moves.
  - News and narrative drivers: Key headlines affecting QQQ (tech earnings, AI, policy, rate expectations, sector rotations).
  - Thematic breakdown: AI/large-cap tech, semis, cloud, consumer tech, geopolitical risk, macro data.
  - Market context: How QQQ’s performance aligns with broader indices, interest-rate expectations, and macro trends.
  - Trader implications: Short-term setup ideas (if any), risk factors, and potential hedges.
  - Risks and caveats: Data limitations, Reddit bias, and macro uncertainty.
  - Data appendix: Source notes, data windows, methodology.

What I will deliver (once data is available)
- A detailed narrative analysis with granular day-by-day sentiment, linked to notable headlines.
- A synthesis of how sentiment data aligns or diverges from price action.
- A concise, actionable conclusions section plus concrete trade considerations.

To move forward, please choose one:
- Please retry the Reddit data pull now (Option A).
- Or confirm you’d like me to proceed with the framework and wait for data (Option B).

If you’d like, I can also provide a ready-to-fill Markdown table template that I’ll populate as soon as the data arrives. Here’s a starter table structure you can expect in the final report:

Markdown table (template)
- Date | Positive Sentiment | Negative Sentiment | Net Sentiment (Pos - Neg) | Top News Headline | Dominant Theme | QQQ Price Change (1D) | Action Signal (if any)

Would you like me to retry the data pull now (Option A), or should I proceed with the framework (Option B)?
