I tried to fetch the Reddit sentiment data for AMD across the requested dates, but the get_reddit_stock_info tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError. Attempts across multiple dates (2025-09-22 through 2025-09-16) and in parallel all errored out. I also attempted a single-date call, and that failed as well.

What I can do right now
- Proceed with a comprehensive AMD sentiment and news analysis framework using the structure I’d normally populate with live data, and clearly mark data as pending until the tool comes back.
- Alternatively, wait a bit and retry the Reddit data fetch, or you can provide an alternative data source (if you have one) to fill in the sentiment numbers.

Proposed plan if you want me to continue now (with placeholders for sentiment data)
1) Executive snapshot
- High-level view of social sentiment trend (pending data) and how it aligns with recent AMD news.

2) Daily sentiment and engagement (structure; fill once data returns)
- For each day in the past week: avg sentiment, sentiment polarity, post volume, top themes, notable posts.
- Overall trend: improving, deteriorating, or mixed.

3) Thematic analysis (top drivers likely to appear)
- AI/ML demand and data center GPU demand
- Gaming/consumer GPU cycles and crypto tailwinds/headwinds
- Product launches or driver issues
- Competitive dynamics with Nvidia and other players
- Supply chain, wafer allocation, MSRP vs. street price
- AI accelerator announcements, partnerships, or enterprise adoption

4) News recap (most impactful items from AMD-related news in the past week)
- Product announcements, earnings guidance, partnerships, supply updates, regulatory or geopolitical factors

5) Market implications for traders
- Short-term catalysts to watch (product launches, earnings inflection points, AI market demand signals)
- Risk factors (chip supply constraints, pricing pressure, competitive threats)
- Positioning implications (when sentiment improves or deteriorates)

6) Risk and caveats
- Sentiment data limitations (reddit signals may be noisy, not representative of all investors)
- Time-lag between sentiment and actual price moves
- Potential overweighting of meme-like dynamics in certain periods

7) Quick-hits actionable takeaways
- If sentiment consolidates around strong AI/data center demand, potential near-term upside if validated by news.
- If concerns about supply constraints or pricing pressure dominate, may indicate downside risk or volatility.

8) MakrMarkdown table (to be populated once data returns)
- A compact table organizing key points, e.g.:

| Date | Avg Sentiment | Post Volume | Top Theme | Notable Post Snippet | AMD News Headline | Price Impact Indicator |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 2025-09-22 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 2025-09-21 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 2025-09-20 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 2025-09-19 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 2025-09-18 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 2025-09-17 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |
| 2025-09-16 | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending | Pending |

Request for your input
- Do you want me to:
  a) Retry the Reddit data fetch now and fill in the report with live data as soon as the tool responds, or
  b) Produce a fully fleshed-out report template (as above) with placeholders and note clearly where data is missing, so you can review the structure and-filled sections later, or
  c) Use any other data source you prefer (if you can provide access or examples)?

If you’d like, I can proceed with option (a) and keep you posted as soon as the tool is back. If you prefer (b), I’ll deliver a complete, well-structured long-form AMD sentiment report with the Markdown table and detailed insights, clearly labeled as data-pending where appropriate.
