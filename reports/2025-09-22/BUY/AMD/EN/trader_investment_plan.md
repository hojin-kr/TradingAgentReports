Recommendation: Buy (with a disciplined, staged-entry plan and strong risk controls)

Summary verdict
- The proposed AMD thesis remains supported by durable AI/data-center tailwinds, a diversified product stack (CPU/GPU/MI/ROCm), and a software moat in ROCm. While near-term noise and competition present headwinds, the upside case—driven by data-center mix shift, margin leverage, and ROCm ecosystem momentum—asks for a phased, risk-managed exposure rather than a full overweight upfront.

Structured plan to implement (aligned with the provided framework)
1) Core stance and position sizing
- Initiate with ~60% of your planned AMD long exposure as the core position.
- Use a laddered add-on approach: increase on confirmed catalysts (data-center/MI/ROCm milestones or Zen 5/Pro progress) or on meaningful price pullbacks into established support.

2) Catalysts and entry points (data-driven triggers)
- Add-on triggers:
  - Confirmed data-center wins or MI/ROCm momentum milestones (hyperscaler deployments, ROCm tooling accelerators, ecosystem announcements).
  - Zen 5/Pro milestones showing meaningful IPC/efficiency gains and server-density uplift.
  - Positive price action with rising volume on up days and improving sentiment around AI capex.
- Conservative entry approach: scale into position on dips to well-established support levels or after constructive catalysts are announced.

3) Risk controls and downside protection
- Stop-loss framework: set an initial stop a defined risk threshold below entry (e.g., 8–15% depending on volatility and your risk tolerance), or below a key moving average if trend confirms a downturn.
- Hedging: consider protective puts or a modest option strategy around earnings/catalysts; for a conservative stance, use a covered-call approach on a portion to monetize time value while preserving upside.
- Diversification: keep AMD exposure within your tech/semi sleeve limits to avoid over-concentration.

4) Operational cadence
- Entry cadence: progress into additional shares after catalysts or on validated pullbacks rather than on hype.
- Review cadence: quarterly reviews aligned with AMD earnings and milestone events; recalibrate thesis if management guidance diverges materially.
- Liquidity/timing: target catalyst-driven windows or pullbacks testing support; avoid forcing buys in overextended momentum rallies.

5) Exit plan and scenario planning
- If catalysts disappoint or margins/ROCm uptake stall: trim exposure or rotate into more defensively positioned tech names.
- If the thesis accelerates (strong data-center wins, MI uptake, ROCm ecosystem expansion): add to full target exposure and consider leveraging via options to capture upside with defined risk.

6) Data gaps and validation
- If indicators return, validate trend and timing for adds (price above 50/200-day averages, MACD cross, RSI, rising ATR with volume).
- If indicators deteriorate, respect the risk signals and slow or reverse exposure.

7) Learning and discipline
- Anchor to durable growth drivers (AI capex resilience, ROCm ecosystem, diversified product cadence) rather than a single quarter.
- Build explicit base/bull/bear scenarios with clear catalysts and action thresholds to re-rate quickly as data arrives.

8) Timeline and expectations
- Time horizon: 12–24 months to meaningful re-rating if AI/data-center demand remains robust and AMD hits multiple milestones.
- Key milestones to monitor: Zen 5/Pro rollout, MI accelerator adoption, ROCm ecosystem growth, and QA of data-center win cadence.

Bottom line
- The bear case remains valid as a reminder to stay disciplined, but the strongest structural drivers—multi-product AI/data-center stack, ROCm moat, and potential margin expansion—support a staged Buy with transparent catalysts and risk controls.

If you want, I can tailor this with your exact portfolio size, risk tolerance, and preferred entry targets (or plug in explicit price targets and stop levels once you share your metrics or when AMD indicators re-emerge).
