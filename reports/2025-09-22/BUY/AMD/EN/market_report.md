I attempted to fetch AMD data and generate the requested indicators, but the data tools returned a FileNotFoundError. I don’t have the latest CSV data or indicator values to present a concrete trend readout right now. If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data immediately, or you can provide the CSV/values you have and I’ll analyze from there. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan with the most relevant indicators you asked for, plus how to interpret them for AMD on a current-market footing once data becomes available.

Selected indicators (maximum 8) and rationale for AMD
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-period simple moving average, a mid-term trend guide.
  - Why AMD: Helps identify the prevailing trend (up, down, or sideways) and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful to confirm mid-term momentum around AI/data-center cycles AMD often reacts to.
- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-period simple moving average, a long-term trend benchmark.
  - Why AMD: Useful for assessing the broader trend context and for spotting golden/death cross setups when the short-term turns cross the 200-MA.
- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: 10-period exponential moving average, a responsive short-term trend/momentum signal.
  - Why AMD: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entry/exit points, particularly around product cycle news or earnings.
- macd
  - What it measures: Difference between two EMAs (momentum/trend strength), gives crossovers.
  - Why AMD: Helps identify shifts in momentum and potential trend changes; signals can be more reliable when combined with other filters.
- macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD), smoothing for crossovers.
  - Why AMD: Crossovers with MACD line can trigger signals with reduced false positives when used with trend context.
- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD histogram, momentum strength (distance between MACD and its signal).
  - Why AMD: Divergence and histogram thickness can indicate momentum turning points ahead of price.
- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative strength index, momentum and potential overbought/oversold levels.
  - Why AMD: Useful to flag extreme conditions (overbought/oversold) and possible reversals, especially when the stock is in a trending phase.
- atr
  - What it measures: Average True Range, volatility level.
  - Why AMD: Key for risk management (position sizing, stop placement) and understanding volatility shifts around earnings or AI-cycle news.

How to interpret these indicators for AMD once data is available
- Trend alignment
  - Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA suggests a bullish tilt; a cross where 50 SMA moves above 200 SMA (golden cross) is a notable long-term bullish signal.
  - Price below both SMAs suggests a bearish or fading trend; a cross below the SMAs strengthens the case for downside pressure.
- Short-term momentum versus trend
  - Price crossing above the 10 EMA in conjunction with MACD rising above zero and a positive MACD histogram (macdh increasing) supports a short-term entry setup in line with the longer trend.
  - If MACD crosses below its signal and macdh turns negative while price loses hold above 50 SMA, risk of a pullback increases.
- Momentum signals
  - RSI moving toward overbought (above ~70) in an uptrend may indicate looming consolidation or a potential pullback; in contrast, RSI near oversold (below ~30) in a downtrend could signal a rebound, especially if price is reverting toward the 50 or 200 SMA.
  - Look for MACD/macd histogram divergences with price as a heads-up for weaker momentum despite price movements.
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising suggests increasing volatility (e.g., around earnings or AI-cycle announcements), calling for wider stop-loss buffers or adjusted position sizing.
  - ATR cooling as volatility declines can accompany consolidation phases and potential breakouts.
- Confirmation filters
  - Use MACD, MACD signal, MACD histogram in concert with RSI to avoid false positives in choppy markets.
  - Validate breakouts above/below key levels (e.g., around 50/200 SMA or recent swing highs/lows) with ATR to gauge whether the move has room to run.

Caveats and guidance
- These indicators are lagging and should be used with price action and fundamental context (AMD’s earnings cycles, AI/compute demand, data-center trends, and supply/demand signals).
- Avoid relying on RSI alone in strong trends; always corroborate with trend indicators (SMAs and MACD) and volatility (ATR).
- If data is noisy (e.g., choppy market conditions), give more weight to MACD history and ATR-based risk controls rather than single cross signals.

Next steps (what I can do for you right away)
- Retry data retrieval for AMD to populate the eight indicators and generate a precise trend report.
- If you have a preferred date range or a specific market regime (earnings week, AI cycle milestones), I can tailor the analysis accordingly.
- Alternatively, you can provide the raw CSV or the values you’ve got for AMD, and I’ll produce the full, detailed trend report with a conclusive interpretation.

Markdown table: key indicators, interpretation targets, and what to watch for AMD

If you want me to proceed, I can retry fetching the data now and then provide a full, concrete trend report with the eight indicators populated for AMD as of 2025-09-22. Would you like me to retry the data pull?
