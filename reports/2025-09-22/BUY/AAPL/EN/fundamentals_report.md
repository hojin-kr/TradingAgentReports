Sorry — I attempted to fetch the required data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin balance sheet/cashflow/income statement for AAPL) but the tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError, indicating a backend issue or misconfigured data source. I can either retry now, or proceed with a structured report that clearly notes the data gaps and provides a thorough framework and qualitative insights you can use in the meantime.

What I can provide right now
- A comprehensive, trader-focused report template for Apple (AAPL) that you can fill in as soon as the data sources are available.
- Clear notes on where data is missing and how that affects the analysis.
- A ready-to-use Markdown table at the end to organize key points.

Recommended next steps
- I can immediately retry the data fetches (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin statements). If you want, I’ll run the requests again now.
- Alternatively, you can provide any alternative data you have (PDFs, screenshots, or CSV exports), and I’ll integrate them into the report.
