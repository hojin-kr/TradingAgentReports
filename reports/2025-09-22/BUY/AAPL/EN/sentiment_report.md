I tried to pull Reddit sentiment data for AAPL for 2025-09-22, 2025-09-21, 2025-09-20, 2025-09-19, 2025-09-18, 2025-09-17, and 2025-09-16, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend/file path issue). Here’s the error I’m seeing:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')
Please fix your mistakes.

What I can do next (your call):
- Retry now: I can attempt another round of calls to the Reddit data tool to see if the backend issue is resolved.
- Switch sources: If you’re open to it, I can proceed with a comprehensive analysis using other sources (e.g., major stock/news outlets, social platforms other than Reddit, and official Apple updates) to build a sentiment/news picture for the past week.
- Prepare the framework now: I can draft the full long-form report structure with clear sections, methodology, and a placeholder table. Then, once the Reddit tool is working, I’ll fill in the Reddit-specific sentiment data and update the table accordingly.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, tell me which option you prefer:
1) Retry Reddit data fetch now
2) Use alternate sources (I’ll gather headlines and public sentiment from other channels and outline the report)
3) Start with a detailed framework and placeholders, to be completed when Reddit data is available

Note: I’ll also prepare a Markdown table at the end of the final report to organize key points, trends, risks, and potential trading implications for traders and investors.
