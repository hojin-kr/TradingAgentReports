I attempted to fetch AAPL data to compute the indicators, but the data retrieval step returned a FileNotFoundError in this environment. It looks like the Yahoo Finance data source or local data access isn’t available right now. I can retry the data fetch, or you can provide a CSV of the data (or allow me to proceed with a qualitative setup). In the meantime, here is a robust set of indicators (up to 8) that provides complementary insights for AAPL and a concise framework you can use once the data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why this combination is suitable for AAPL
- Trend confirmation and context (close_50_sma, close_200_sma): The 50-period and 200-period moving averages help determine the primary trend and key support/resistance levels. The 200-SMA acts as a broad market anchor; price above suggests bullish long-term context, while a cross of 50-SMA with 200-SMA can signal a change in trend direction (golden/death cross) and is useful to filter trades.
- Early momentum signals (close_10_ema): The 10-EMA reacts quickly to price changes, offering timely momentum cues to complement slower moving averages. It’s especially useful for spotting short-term shifts when used with the longer-term trend backdrop.
- Core momentum and signals (macd, macds, macdh): MACD components provide a cohesive picture of momentum and potential trend changes. The MACD line crossing the MACD Signal, the histogram strength, and any divergences together help validate entries, exits, or adjustments in exposure.
- Momentum strength and reversal cues (rsi): RSI adds a momentum-tilt perspective with overbought/oversold context and divergence signals. It helps identify potential reversals or sustainability of moves when used with trend indicators.
- Volatility and risk management (atr): ATR measures volatility to inform risk controls, stop placement, and position sizing. Rising ATR often accompanies news-driven moves or breakout phases; use it to adapt risk grips rather than static stops.

How to interpret these indicators together (general guidelines)
- If price is above both 50-SMA and 200-SMA, and 50-SMA is above 200-SMA (bullish trend context), look for:
  - 10-EMA turning upward or crossing above price as short-term momentum in favor.
  - MACD line above MACD Signal with positive MACD Histogram increasing.
  - RSI rising but not in extreme overbought territory (watch for divisions with price).
  - ATR rising gradually in the absence of extreme news for adjusted stops.
- If price starts testing or crossing below the 50-SMA while price remains above 200-SMA, be cautious:
  - MACD signals (line crossing below Signal, histogram turning negative) could indicate a momentum shift.
  - RSI failing to make new highs on rallies may signal weakening momentum despite trend’s intactness.
  - ATR behavior around support levels can hint at whether moves are consolidations or breaks.
- In choppy or range-bound conditions:
  - Expect more frequent MACD crosses and RSI oscillations; rely on confluence with price action around the 50-SMA and 200-SMA rather than single indicators.
  - Use ATR to avoid underestimating risk in a higher-volatility environment; widen stops if ATR expands.

What to do next (data required)
- If you can re-run the data fetch or provide a CSV, I’ll generate the actual current readings for AAPL and deliver:
  - A precise trend assessment (current position relative to 50/200 SMA).
  - MACD/MACD-Signals/MACD-Histogram readings and their changes.
  - RSI level with any notable divergences.
  - ATR-based risk parameters (e.g., stop distances).
  - A concise, action-oriented interpretation and a signal table for quick reference.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation (8 indicators)

| Indicator | What it measures | How to use / Signals | Practical caveats |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50-SMA suggests uptrend; look for crossovers with price/10-EMA; use as a trend filter | Lagging indicator; may not capture fast moves in choppy markets |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200-SMA indicates bullish macro trend; monitor golden/death cross with 50-SMA | Very slow to respond; not ideal for timing entries on quick moves |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick momentum cue; look for price/EMA cross and bullish/bearish acceleration | Prone to noise; confirm with longer-dated indicators for reliability |
| macd | Momentum/trend-change signal | MACD line crossing MACD Signal, plus histogram strength, signals momentum shifts | Can produce false positives in low-volatility or sideways markets; use with filters |
| macds | MACD Signal smoothed line | Cross of MACD with MACD Signal reinforces timing; corroborate with MACD histogram | Lag inherent to signal line; rely on additional confirmation |
| macdh | MACD Histogram strength | Positive and growing histogram indicates strengthening momentum; negative/contracting suggests weakening | Can be volatile; watch for abrupt histogram spikes in fast moves |
| rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold | RSI > 70 (overbought) or < 30 (oversold); watch for divergences with price | In strong trends RSI can stay extended; use trend context for interpretation |
| atr | Market volatility and risk management | Higher ATR implies wider stop distances and larger position sizing allowances; adjust risk plan accordingly | Reactive measure; does not predict direction by itself |

If you’d like, I can re-attempt data retrieval right away or work with any data you provide. Let me know how you’d prefer to proceed, and I’ll tailor the analysis to the actual readings once available.
