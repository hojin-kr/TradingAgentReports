## Executive Snapshot
- iPhone 17 launch momentum and strong early demand in China/India bolster upside for AAPL.

- Tech leadership: Apple’s ecosystem moat and Services/Wearables mix provide ballast amid AI headlines.  
- Global demand signals: China/India iPhone 17 demand strength remains a critical driver; sustained demand could justify multiple expansion vs peers.
