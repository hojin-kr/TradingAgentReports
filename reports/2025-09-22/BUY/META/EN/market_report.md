I attempted to fetch META data from Yahoo Finance using the provided tool, but the data retrieval returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t generate the actual indicator values yet. I can still provide a robust indicator setup tailored to META and a detailed interpretation framework so we’re ready to act as soon as the data is available. If you’d like, I can retry the data pull now and then present live readings and signals.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, chosen for complementary insights on META)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the intermediate trend direction and acts as a dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming trend when used with faster momentum signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; useful to confirm overall market regime and to validate potential golden/death cross setups with the 50 SMA.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Provides a quick read on short-term momentum; can help detect momentum shifts ahead of longer averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum oscillator based on EMA differences; helps identify trend changes via crossovers and divergences.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoothed EMA of MACD; crossovers with MACD line provide trigger signals when confirming momentum shifts.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential; useful for spotting early momentum changes, especially in fast markets.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing; reactive but essential for adaptive risk controls.
- boll_ub: Bollinger Upper Band. Signals potential overbought conditions and potential breakout zones; works well with complementary momentum/volatility signals to gauge exhaustion or continuation.

Why these 8 are suitable for META (contextual notes)
- META tends to exhibit notable volatility driven by earnings, product cycles, and regulatory/news flows. ATR helps size risk appropriately during such moves.
- The 50/200 SMA pair anchors trend assessment; META’s longer-term trend cycles can be clarified by watching for golden/death crosses and price interactions with these bands.
- The 10 EMA provides timely momentum signals to complement the slower SMA regime, helping catch shifts before they fully manifest in the price.
- MACD and its components give a robust, multi-faceted view of momentum: MACD line (direction), signal line (crossover confirmation), and histogram (momentum strength). This trio reduces reliance on a single signal in choppy markets.
- Bollinger Upper Band offers a practical read on breakout/overbought conditions when used with other signals (e.g., MACD, price above moving averages). It helps identify potential mean reversion zones or continuation plays in META’s price action.

Nuanced interpretation framework (how to read signals once data is available)
- Trend confirmation
  - Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA suggests an uptrend; consider pullbacks to the 50 SMA as potential entries if momentum and volatility signals align.
  - Cross of 50 SMA above 200 SMA (golden cross) strengthens the bullish case; a cross below (death cross) strengthens bearish cues.
- Momentum checks
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal line while the histogram is increasing supports a bullish continuation; a cross below with a shrinking histogram warns of a potential reversal or slowdown.
  - If price is above the 50/200 SMAs but MACD is diverging (price rising, MACD falling), be cautious of a potential hidden weakness or a pullback.
- Volatility and risk
  - Rising ATR indicates increasing volatility; if momentum signals align with higher ATR, use wider stop distances and potentially smaller position sizes.
  - A sharp expansion in the MACD histogram concurrent with a spike in ATR can signal a strong move but also higher risk; consider monitoring for confirmation from price action and upper/lower Bollinger bands.
- Bollinger bands signals
  - Price testing or breaking above the Bollinger Upper Band with MACD bullish and ATR rising could indicate a strong breakout, but verify with volume and a pullback test to the 50 SMA before entering.
  - If price rides the upper band but MACD is flat or diverging, this may reflect sustained volatility without real momentum—be cautious of false breakouts.
- Trade setup considerations
  - Entry ideas: look for confluence where price is above both SMAs (trend), MACD bull cross with rising histogram (momentum), ATR rising (volatility), and price near or breaking the upper band (breakout potential).
  - Risk management: use ATR to set initial stop distance; consider trailing stops or a fixed risk percent per trade; adjust position size as volatility changes.
  - Exit ideas: take profits near resistance surrounding the 50 SMA or upper Bollinger band if momentum weakens or MACD histogram starts to contract; otherwise, let a strong trend ride with discipline on trailing stops.

Next steps
- I can retry the data pull (get_YFin_data) for META to obtain the CSV, and then run get_stockstats_indicators_report for the eight indicators above to generate live readings and a concrete, data-driven set of signals.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative interpretation framework now (as above) and switch to quantitative readings as soon as the data becomes available.

Key points at a glance (for quick reference)
- Trend anchors: 50 SMA and 200 SMA; watch for golden/death cross signals.
- Short-term momentum: 10 EMA in conjunction with MACD lines and histogram.
- Volatility and risk: ATR informs stop placement and sizing; monitor changes in ATR with price action.
- Breakout signals: Bollinger Upper Band as a cue for potential breakout zones, to be used with MACD and price-action confirmation.
