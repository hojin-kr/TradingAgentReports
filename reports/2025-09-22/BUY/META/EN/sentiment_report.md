Thanks for the prompt. The Reddit stock info tool is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError when I try to fetch META data for 2025-09-22. I can’t pull the Reddit signals right now. I can either retry the tool momentarily or proceed with a comprehensive qualitative analysis using other public signals and a prepared framework, then fill in Reddit details once the tool is available again.

Here are two options:
- Option A: Retry now to fetch Reddit data, then deliver the full long report with Reddit-specific sentiment and threads included.
- Option B: Proceed with a high-quality, all-source qualitative analysis (excluding Reddit for now) and provide a robust framework and insights that traders can use, plus a Markdown table skeleton to be populated with Reddit data when the tool becomes available.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option B right away, here is a detailed plan and a ready-to-fill structure you can expect:

What I will deliver (Option B)
- Executive snapshot
  - Core sentiment takeaway on META over the past week
  - Key catalysts driving sentiment (news, earnings expectations, product launches, regulatory updates)
  - Immediate implications for traders (short-term moves, IV, risk concerns)

- News & catalysts (last 7 days)
  - Summary of notable company announcements and regulatory/regulatory-adjacent items
  - Market/industry context (AI rollout, ad market dynamics, competition, regulatory environment)
  - Potential longer-term impacts on revenue mix and margins

- Social sentiment overview (excluding Reddit for now)
  - Aggregated sentiment signals from available sources (e.g., X/Twitter chatter, stock discussion forums other than Reddit, mainstream news sentiment)
  - Thematic breakdown: AI/LLM, privacy/regulatory concerns, monetization strategies, metaverse/VR progress, ad-targeting changes, leadership commentary
  - Day-by-day sentiment flavor (positive, neutral, negative) with caveats about data reliability and sample size

- Thematic insights and implications for traders
  - Short-term catalysts to watch (earnings cadence, product launches, user metrics, regulatory rulings)
  - Risks to the thesis (execution delays, competitive pressure, ad market weakness, regulatory headwinds)
  - Flow considerations (options activity signals, implied volatility levers, sector rotation dynamics)

- Quantifiable signals to watch (without Reddit data)
  - Key price/volatility clues (gap risks, intraday ranges, volume spikes)
  - Sentiment proxies from other sources (e.g., notable bullish/bearish sentiment swings on non-Reddit platforms)
  - headlines-to-price impact heuristics (how certain headline themes have moved META historically)

- Trader-oriented conclusions
  - Trading stance guidance (position sizing guardrails, entry/exit ideas, risk controls)
  - Scenarios and probability-weighted outcomes
  - What would invalidate the thesis (kill-switch scenarios)

- Markdown table (to organize key points)
  - I will fill this with a table like the following once data is available:
    - Date
    - Platform/Source
    - Headline / Theme
    - Sentiment (Pos/Neu/Neg)
    - Engagement/Reach
    - Catalyst / News Item
    - Implication for META stock
    - Suggested action (Buy/Hold/Sell or more nuanced)
    - Notes

If you want me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll reattempt the Reddit data fetch and then deliver the full long report with Reddit sentiment incorporated. If you prefer Option B, I’ll start with the qualitative, multi-source analysis immediately and provide the structured report plus the Markdown table skeleton, ready to be populated with Reddit data once available.

Please tell me which option you’d like, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
