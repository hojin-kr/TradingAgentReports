# Investment Report: NFLX
## Executive Summary
Netflix aims to lift profits from ads, international pricing, and stronger monetization. Near-term risks include licensing costs and leadership-change execution.

## Investment Decision
BUY. Confidence: Medium-High

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Multi-pillar monetization: Ads, higher international pricing, and better monetization of existing users could expand profits rather to rely on one single driver.
- Ad revenue upside: Growth from ads could improve margins and operating leverage, acting as a key profitability lever.
- International pricing and currency: Higher revenue per user in international markets and smarter currency management can lift margins.
- Clear execution path: A well-defined plan after leadership changes could unlock sustained growth.

## Risks To Watch
- Licensing costs: Content licensing could pressure profit margins if they rise faster than monetization gains.
- Leadership transition: Execution risk during leadership change could slow progress.
- Ad-cycle and regulation: Advertising cycles and regulatory hurdles could reduce upside.
- FX headwinds: Currency moves in international markets could dampen revenue growth.
- Sub growth and monetization durability: Slower subscriber growth or weaker monetization durability could erode the expected upside.
