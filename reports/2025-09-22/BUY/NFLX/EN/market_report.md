I’m sorry — I attempted to fetch NFLX data (Yahoo Finance) but hit an internal FileNotFoundError in my current environment. Because of that, I can’t generate a real-time trend report for NFLX right now. I can still proceed in two helpful ways:

- Option A: I outline a robust, complementary set of indicators to use once data fetch works, plus how I’d interpret them together for NFLX.
- Option B: If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch right away or adjust the date range and try again.

Please tell me which option you prefer. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan and a ready-to-use indicator set for NFLX, with explanations of why they’re suitable for a stock in a high-visibility, discretionary-growth/consumer tech space.

Recommended indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Captures the medium-term trend; acts as dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm whether NFLX is in a broader uptrend or downtrend relative to a 6–9 month horizon without being too reactive to daily noise.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming whether recent action aligns with the larger regime (e.g., bullish trend above the 200 SMA suggests structural strength; death cross vs. golden cross considerations can guide strategic views).
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  Why: Provides a more responsive view of momentum shifts than the longer SMAs. Useful for early entry/exit cues in a trending market, especially when price action starts to gain/lose steam.
- macd (MACD)
  Why: Classic momentum/trend indicator. Looks for MACD line crossovers and divergence with price to spot potential trend changes or acceleration in momentum.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  Why: The signal line crossover with MACD is a common trigger in a broader strategy. Helps filter MACD redraws and reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  Why: Visualizes the gap between MACD and its signal, giving a quick sense of momentum strength and potential narrowing/widening of the trend’s pace.
- rsi (RSI)
  Why: Momentum oscillator that flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Useful in confirming trend-driven moves when RSI is moving away from extreme levels or diverging from price.
- atr (ATR)
  Why: Measures volatility, aiding risk management (position sizing and stop placement). In a stock like NFLX where volatility can spike on earnings or subscriber news, ATR helps calibrate stops and risk per trade.

Rationale for these choices (contextual guidance)
- Coverage: The eight indicators provide a balanced view across trend direction (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA), momentum (MACD family, RSI), and risk management (ATR). This yields complementary signals without overlapping meaningfully.
- Redundancy avoidance: I avoided stacking multiple oscillators (e.g., StochRSI) that measure similar conditions. The chosen RSI covers momentum, while MACD lines capture crossovers and momentum shifts. The combination of SMAs with EMA adds both smoother and more reactive trend checks.
- Market-context fit: NFLX is a high-profile name with potential earnings-driven volatility. The mix of trend (SMA/EMA), momentum (MACD family, RSI), and volatility (ATR) helps identify potential breakouts, pullbacks, or volatility-managed entries in a stock with uneven daily moves.

What I can deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced trend report with:
  - Current position of price relative to 50 SMA, 200 SMA, and 10 EMA.
  - MACD/macd/macdh readings and any recent crossovers/divergences.
  - RSI status (overbought/oversold zones, trend discipline considerations).
  - ATR context for risk management and stop placement.
  - Short paragraph interpreting how these signals cohere (e.g., price above all major moving averages with bullish MACD cross and rising RSI suggests a higher-probability uptrend; if ATR is contracting, it may indicate a consolidating phase with breakout potential).
- A clear table summarizing the signals by indicator, with short notes on actionability (entry, exit, or guardrail warnings).
- A compact, trader-ready table (as requested) at the end.

Next steps
- Please choose one of the following:
  1) I retry the data fetch now (or with an adjusted date range) and then provide the full, data-backed report with the 8 indicators listed above.
  2) If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative framework now (without live data) showing how to read these indicators together and what potential signals to watch for NFLX in future sessions.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now (with the same dates or a new window), so I can generate the full, data-backed NFLX trend report using these eight indicators? If you have a preferred date range (e.g., last 180 days, last 365 days, or a specific period around earnings), tell me and I’ll use that.
