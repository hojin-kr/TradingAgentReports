Sorry about that—the Reddit sentiment tool for NFLX seems to be returning a file-not-found error right now. I attempted parallel fetches for 2025-09-22 through 2025-09-16, but the calls failed, including a direct retry for 2025-09-22.

What I can do now
- Retry the Reddit stock-info tool immediately to pull daily sentiment for NFLX for the dates you asked.
- If the tool remains unavailable, I can proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis based on available public signals (recent news, known catalysts, general social-media sentiment patterns) and clearly mark data gaps.

Please tell me which you prefer:
1) I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then deliver the full long-form report with day-by-day sentiment, themes, and a concluding trader-oriented view, plus the required Markdown table.
2) I proceed with a synthesized analysis using other publicly known signals (news headlines, major events, and typical Netflix sentiment drivers) and provide a detailed narrative with a placeholder table you can update once the data tool is back.

If you choose 1, I’ll run the fetch again and produce:
- Daily sentiment breakdown (positive/neutral/negative) for NFLX for 2025-09-16 to 2025-09-22
- Key themes by date (e.g., content slate, pricing/news, subscriber trends, competition)
- Relevant company news snippets from the same window
- Implications for traders (risk/reward, potential volatility drivers, and timing considerations)
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing: Date, Sentiment, Top Topic, News Impact, Trader Note

If you choose 2, I’ll draft a comprehensive narrative focusing on:
- What social chatter typically signals for NFLX around new content, pricing moves, or platform changes
- How recent Netflix news and industry context could influence sentiment and positioning
- A structured, date-aggregated interpretation with caveats
- The same end-table layout with placeholder data you can fill once I pull the exact sentiment numbers

Let me know which route you prefer, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
