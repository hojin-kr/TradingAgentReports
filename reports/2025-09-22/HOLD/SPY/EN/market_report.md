Thanks for the ticker. I hit a data-access issue on the current environment when trying to fetch SPY data, so I can’t produce the full, data-driven trend report right now. Specifically, the Yahoo Finance data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError, and parallel requests for the indicator calculations also failed due to the same underlying data access problem. I’m happy to retry automatically as soon as the data service is available again, or we can proceed with a plan and indicator framework in the meantime.

What I can do now
- Propose a robust, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators tailored for SPY (to cover trend, momentum, volatility, and risk management) and outline how they would be interpreted once data is accessible.
- Provide a clear rationale for each indicator, plus practical usage notes for SPY, so you’re ready to act once the data flow is restored.
- Include a compact table summarizing key points to keep handy.

Selected indicators for SPY (8 total)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Price above 50SMA suggests a bullish tilt; price near or pulling back toward 50SMA can be a bounce area; use as a trend filter when combining with faster signals.
  - Caveats: Lagging; signals are stronger when aligned with other indicators.

- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend benchmark.
  - How to use: Price above 200SMA supports a longer-term bullish regime; crosses or proximity to 200SMA can indicate major trend using as a backdrop for entries/exits.
  - Caveats: Very lagging; best used for strategic context rather than precise timing.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average; responsive short-term momentum.
  - How to use: Price crossing above/below 10EMA can signal quicker momentum shifts; use in conjunction with the longer-term trend (50SMA/200SMA) to filter false signals.
  - Caveats: Prone to noise in choppy markets; filter with trend context.

- macd (MACD)
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; convergence/divergence with price.
  - How to use: MACD line crossing above its signal line is a bullish cue; cross below is bearish; look for bullish/bearish divergence for potential reversals.
  - Caveats: More reliable in directional markets; confirm with other indicators.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: The EMA-smoothed MACD line (the signal line).
  - How to use: Crosses between MACD and MACDS can trigger entries/exits; use histogram for momentum strength and potential early divergence signals.
  - Caveats: Can generate false signals in low-volatility periods; require a broader confirmation.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: RSI > 70 signals overbought; RSI < 30 signals oversold; watch for divergences with price as potential reversals; in strong trends, extended readings can persist, so use with trend context.
  - Caveats: In strong trends, RSI can stay overbought/oversold for extended periods; rely on trend filters.

- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - What it measures: Bollinger Middle is the 20-period SMA used as the baseline for the bands.
  - How to use: Price interacting with the middle line helps assess mean-reversion vs. breakout tendencies; combine with upper/lower bands to identify breakout zones or reversals.
  - Caveats: In strong trends, prices may ride the bands; signals should be validated with other tools.

- atr (ATR)
  - What it measures: Volatility via Average True Range.
  - How to use: Use ATR to set stop-loss distances and adjust position sizing according to current volatility; larger ATR implies wider stops; smaller ATR allows tighter risk controls.
  - Caveats: It’s reactive, not directional; best used for risk management rather than signal generation alone.

Why this set is suitable for SPY
- It covers multiple facets of market behavior: trend direction (50SMA and 200SMA), timely momentum (10EMA with MACD family and RSI), volatility and risk (ATR and Bollinger middle), and a practical price-action filter (Bollinger context).
- It avoids overlapping signals (e.g., avoids stacking redundant momentum oscillators) while still giving a diverse set of confirmation tools.
- It’s well-suited to a broad SPY trading style, particularly swing trading or trend-following approaches, where you want both direction and risk controls.

Next steps
- I’ll reattempt data retrieval and indicator calculations as soon as the data service becomes available again. If you’d like, I can automatically retry at intervals or on a new date window (e.g., last 1 year, last 2 years) to maximize the chance of a successful run.
- Alternatively, if you prefer a different set of indicators (e.g., adding boll_ub or boll_lb instead of boll middle, or swapping RSI for Stochastic RSI), I can adjust the selection.

Appendix: quick reference table (indicator summary)
- The following table summarizes the 8 indicators and their intended use for SPY when data is available.

Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for SPY | Caveats
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | 50-day trend, dynamic support/resistance | Trend filter: price > 50SMA = bullish backdrop; use with other signals for entries | Lagging
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | 200-day trend benchmark | Long-term context: price > 200SMA supports bullish regime; cross/near signals indicate major shifts | Very lagging
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Early momentum cue: price cross above/below 10EMA; pair with longer-term trend for entry timing | Noise in choppy markets
- macd | MACD | Momentum via MACD line vs price | Bullish cross (MACD above signal) or bearish cross; seek divergence confirmations | Needs other filters in low-volatility regimes
- macds | MACD Signal | MACD smoothing signal line | Crosses with MACD to trigger entries/exits; gauge momentum strength via histogram | Can produce false signals in quiet markets
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | RSI > 70 overbought; < 30 oversold; watch for divergences; respect trend context | Can stay extended in strong trends
- boll | Bollinger Middle | 20SMA baseline for bands | Use middle line as mean-reversion anchor; confirm with bands for breakouts/reversals | Bands can ride in strong trends
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility | Use for dynamic stop distances and position sizing; adjust risk with volatility | Reactive metric; not directional

Would you like me to retry fetching SPY data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the outlined framework and come back with the data-driven report as soon as the data tool is available again? If you have any preferred time horizon (intraday, swing, or long-term) or risk settings, tell me and I’ll tailor the plan accordingly.
