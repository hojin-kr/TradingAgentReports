Thanks for confirming. I attempted to fetch SPY Reddit sentiment for 2025-09-22, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). That looks like a tooling environment problem rather than an issue with SPY itself. I don’t have a fresh data feed from Reddit right now.

What I can do next (your call):
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately and proceed with the full analysis as soon as it returns.
- Switch data path: I can proceed with a materially similar sentiment analysis using other sources you’re comfortable with (e.g., public news, StockTwits, Twitter/X sentiment) if you have access to those feeds, or I can present a high-quality plan and structure for the report and wait for Reddit data to come back.
- Wait and monitor: I can queue up a retry on a short interval (e.g., every few minutes) and deliver the report as soon as data is retrieved.

If you’d like me to proceed with the next step right away, please choose one:
1) Retry Reddit data fetch now and build the full report once it returns.
2) Build the report structure now using only news and general market sentiment (no Reddit data) and fill in Reddit insights later.
3) Provide a different data source you want me to pull sentiment from (if available).

What I will deliver in the full report (once data is available):
- Executive summary: Overall tone of social chatter around SPY this week, with a focus on net sentiment, sentiment dispersion, and notable spikes.
- Daily sentiment analysis: Day-by-day sentiment scores, volume, and notable drivers (economic data, Fed commentary, geopolitical news, earnings from major holdings).
- Top topics and sentiment drivers: Key themes driving sentiment (inflation expectations, rate path, macro risk events, tech earnings, etc.).
- News synthesis: Summary of SPY-relevant headlines from the past week and their potential impact on price action.
- Implications for traders/investors:
  - Short-term trading signals (if any from sentiment spikes, fade zones, or risk-on/risk-off shifts).
  - Medium-term risk and narrative shifts (macro, sector rotation, volatility cues).
  - Volume and participation considerations (retail vs. institutional sentiment cues, if detectable).
- Risks and caveats: Data limitations, biases in social data, SPY’s nature as an ETF (diversified exposure to the S&P 500), and how macro events can overpower sentiment signals.
- Markdown table: A concise table at the end summarizing key points for quick reference.

Let me know which option you prefer, and I’ll move forward accordingly.
