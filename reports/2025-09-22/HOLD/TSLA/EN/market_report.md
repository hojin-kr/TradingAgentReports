I attempted to fetch TSLA data (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-22) and run the indicator reports, but the data fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can proceed in two ways:
- Retry the data retrieval now and then deliver a full, data-driven, nuanced report.
- If you prefer, I can provide a detailed, non-data-dependent framework right away (indicator setup, interpretation rules, and decision guidance) and populate the exact readings once the data fetch succeeds.

For now, I’ve prepared the indicator setup and how I will interpret them once the data is available. I’m selecting 8 indicators that give complementary, non-redundant signals focused on trend, momentum, and volatility.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Rationale for the selection
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming the prevailing trend and filtering entries in conjunction with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps identify secular bias (bullish/bearish) and can confirm golden/death cross setups when the price interacts with this level.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts and potential entry points, especially around pullbacks to moving averages.
- macd: Core momentum gauge. Crossover and divergence signals help identify potential trend changes in conjunction with price action and moving averages.
- macds: MACD signal line. Crossovers with MACD are a standard trigger/confirmation mechanism to avoid false signals from MACD alone.
- macdh: MACD histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and potential divergences earlier; useful for confirming MACD-based signals in faster markets.
- rsi: Relative strength momentum indicator. Flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals, with divergence considerations. Helps assess momentum strength in the context of the trend.
- atr: Average true range. Measures volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing, especially in TSLA’s typically volatile environment.

How I’ll interpret these together (once data is available)
- Trend confirmation: If price sits above both 50SMA and 200SMA, with 10EMA above 50SMA, that supports a bullish context. If price is below both SMAs, the bearish context is stronger, and we’d look for resistance tests near those levels.
- Momentum alongside trend: MACD and RSI help validate whether momentum supports the trend. For example, a bullish setup with MACD bullish cross and RSI above 50 (and not overbought) adds conviction; conversely, bullish price action with MACD weakening or RSI overbought could signal a potential pullback.
- Entry/exit signals: Crossovers in MACD and MACD signal, supported by a favorable RSI reading and a pullback to the 10EMA or the 50SMA, can provide defined entry points with a next-level stop placed using ATR-derived volatility.
- Volatility and risk management: ATR will guide stop distances and position sizing. In TSLA’s high-volatility regime, ATR-based stops help avoid premature exits on typical intraday swings.
- Divergence considerations: Watch for MACD histogram shifts and RSI divergences against price action, which can precede reversals or indicate weakening momentum even if price remains in a trend channel.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now and then deliver a full, data-backed, nuanced trend report including:
  - Current TSLA price relative to the 50SMA and 200SMA
  - MACD, MACD signal, and MACD histogram readings with recent crossovers/divergences
  - RSI level and any notable divergence
  - ATR-derived stop levels and current volatility assessment
  - A concise set of actionable insights (entry/exit ideas, risk controls)

Please let me know if you want me to retry the data fetch now. If you prefer, I can provide the data-free version with explicit interpretation rules and decision guidance immediately, and then attach the live readings as soon as the data becomes available. 

Markdown summary table (indicator setup and interpretation blueprint)

- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - Purpose: Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  - Signals/notes: Price above = bullish bias; price below = bearish bias; use with faster signals to time entries

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - Purpose: Long-term trend confirmation
  - Signals/notes: Price above/below informs macro bias; watch for golden/death cross context

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - Purpose: Short-term momentum
  - Signals/notes: Use for quick shifts; can create noise in choppy markets; filter with longer-term indicators

- Indicator: macd
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend change potential
  - Signals/notes: Bullish cross (MACD above signal) strengthens uptrends; bearish cross weakens uptrends

- Indicator: macds
  - Purpose: MACD signal line cross confirmations
  - Signals/notes: Cross with MACD line as trigger/confirmation

- Indicator: macdh
  - Purpose: Momentum strength and divergence visualization
  - Signals/notes: Histogram expansion/contraction indicates momentum strength; watch for divergences

- Indicator: rsi
  - Purpose: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold context
  - Signals/notes: >70 overbought, <30 oversold (adjust thresholds in strong trends); use with trend indicators to avoid false reversals

- Indicator: atr
  - Purpose: Volatility and risk management
  - Signals/notes: Higher ATR implies wider stops and larger risk per trade; lower ATR implies tighter stops

Please confirm whether you’d like me to retry the data fetch now, and I’ll produce a detailed, data-backed TSLA report as soon as the CSV data is retrieved.
