Thanks for the prompt. I ran into a technical issue fetching the requested insider sentiment/transactions and financial statements for TSLA (FileNotFoundError). I can’t pull the latest figures right now, so I’ll lay out two options and proceed with the one you prefer:

- Option A (preferred): Retry data retrieval now and then deliver a comprehensive, data-driven fundamental report with a detailed Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative, framework-focused Tesla fundamental report (no live data) that you can fill in later when the data tools succeed.

Please tell me which you prefer. In the meantime, here’s a concrete plan and a structured template you can expect once the data is available.

What I will deliver (once data retrieval succeeds)
- Company profile and business overview
  - Segments: Automotive, Energy Generation & Storage, Services & Other
  - Key revenue drivers, geographic exposure, and unit economics considerations
- Recent financial history (past week/quarterly context)
  - Revenue trends, gross margin, operating margin, and net income direction
  - Cash flow health: operating cash flow, investing cash flow, financing cash flow
  - Capital expenditure intensity and free cash flow (FCF) dynamics
- Balance sheet snapshot
  - Liquidity metrics (cash, working capital), debt levels, maturities
  - Asset quality and leverage indicators
- Income statement snapshot
  - Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, and margin trends
- Cash flow statement snapshot
  - Cash flow from operations, capex, free cash flow
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions
  - Summary of sentiment direction over the past 15 days
  - Notable insider buys/sells and potential implications
- Key risk factors and catalysts (short-term and on the horizon)
- Trader-focused takeaways
  - Fundamental strength, growth runway, margin management, and capital allocation
  - Liquidity and debt risk, supply chain/capex considerations, regulatory/regulatory-credit dynamics
- Quick peer benchmarking (Tesla vs peers like BYD, NIO, XPEV, etc.)
- Markdown table: a concise, at-a-glance summary of the most important data points

Proposed Markdown table (structure you’ll see at the end)
- Columns: Area, Data Point, Latest Reading, Trend (MoM/QoQ), Confidence, Notes/Sources
- Rows will cover sections such as Company Profile, Revenue & Margin, Cash Flow, Balance Sheet, Insider Sentiment, Insider Transactions, Risks & Catalysts

Next steps
- If you want Option A (retry data retrieval now), I’ll attempt the tool calls again and then deliver the full, data-backed report with the final Markdown table.
- If you prefer Option B (qualitative framework now), I’ll produce a detailed, narrative Tesla fundamental report using established context up to 2024-06 and the general market environment, clearly marking data gaps to be filled when data tools succeed.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and I’ll proceed immediately. If you’d like me to retry, I can also try a quick follow-up now and report back with results as soon as the data is retrieved.
