# Trader Investment Plan

Executive summary
- The bull case for META remains intact: a durable uptrend, AI-enabled monetization potential (ARPU and CPM upside), growing Reels/commerce monetization, and a widening data network moat support a longer-term re-rating. Near-term volatility (high ATR, price hovering near 50SMA, momentum not yet robust) justifies a disciplined, staged entry rather than chasing a breakout.
- Bear risks are real but manageable with defined risk controls: ad-market cyclicality, AI ROI uncertainty, near-term margin pressure, and regulatory/privacy headwinds. These risks don’t derail the core thesis of a multi-year monetization runway.

Recommendation
- Initiate a staged long position in META around the 735–740 zone, with planned adds on confirming momentum and volume. This aligns with the plan’s rationale to enter on a test of the 50SMA and to scale in as flow confirms.

Actionable plan (two stages, with optional subsequent escalation)
1) Initial starter (entry): Buy META in the 735–740 window
   - Position size: 25–40% of your intended full exposure (to limit initial risk and leave room for follow-on).
   - Stop loss: 1.0–1.5x ATR below entry, roughly 725–730 (ATR ~16–17). This provides protection against volatility spikes.
   - Rationale: Entry near the 50SMA offers favorable risk/reward if price holds and buyers step in; controls keep you from chasing a higher risk entry.
2) First confirm-and-add level: Add 25–35% of the planned total position
   - Trigger: Close above 745–750 with stronger volume and MACD turning toward a bullish cross (plus RSI lifting).
   - Rationale: Momentum and volume confirmation increases odds of a sustained move toward the next resistance bands.
3) Secondary confirmation and target expansion: Scale toward full exposure
   - Trigger: Break above 762–770 on convincing volume, with MACD/RSI confirm.
   - Targets: Primary around 762–770; secondary at 790–800 if momentum persists and volume remains robust.
4) Risk management and trail
   - Once meaningful size is reached, implement a trailing stop (e.g., 1x–1.5x ATR or move stop to the prior swing high).
   - Review weekly or after major earnings/AI milestones; adjust as needed.
5) Capital and risk budgeting
   - Keep any single trade risk to 1–2% of portfolio equity for the initial leg; total exposure not to exceed 6–8% until price action confirms the thesis.
6) Catalysts to monitor
   - AI monetization milestones (ARPU/ CPM improvements, monetization traction in Reels/commerce).
   - Regional ad growth, earnings guidance, and regulatory/privacy developments affecting measurement or targeting.

Risk considerations and safeguards
- If price fails to reclaim the 50SMA or breaks the initial stop around 725–730, reassess quickly and consider exiting to preserve capital.
- Expect elevated swings; use the ATR-based stops and confirm signals (volume, MACD, RSI) rather than reacting to every dip.
- Stay attuned to macro/regulatory headlines; adjust exposure if ad-tech measurement or privacy constraints escalate.
- Do not rely solely on AI ROI assumptions; confirm with real-world monetization metrics before large-scale additions.

Lessons applied
- Avoid chasing breakouts; wait for momentum/volume confirmation.
- Use a multi-indicator filter (MACD, RSI, volume) for entries and adds.
- Size for risk first, potential second; mechanical risk controls protect against outsized losses.
- Maintain defined risk caps to ensure the plan remains executable across headlines and macro moves.

If you want, I can format this into two one-click ideas with exact entries, stops, and risk budgets. But the core plan provides a disciplined framework to participate in META’s upside while maintaining risk discipline.
