# Trader Investment Plan

Based on the proposed plan and current technical context for AMZN, the recommended action is to HOLD for now.

Rationale
- Near-term setup remains balanced-to-bearish: MACD shows a small negative histogram, RSI is neutral, and price remains in a shallow pullback just below the 10-day EMA. These signals suggest no clean breakout yet.
- Long-term thesis remains intact: AWS growth, Prime/ad monetization, and ecosystem advantages support a favorable multi-quarter view.
- The plan emphasizes discipline: wait for a clean momentum reclaim before initiating a full long position, rather than chasing a dip or a fragile breakout.

Entry-trigger criteria (for transitioning from HOLD to BUY)
- Price closes above the 10-day EMA (roughly 227.5–228 area) and decisively above the 50-day SMA (roughly 224 area).
- MACD turns green (positive histogram or a clear MACD cross) while RSI remains in a neutral zone (approximately 45–55).
- These conditions hold for a session or two, at which point you can initiate a staged long entry (e.g., first tranche).

Risk controls and targets
- Stop loss: place just below the 50-day SMA around 223–224, or 1.0–1.25× ATR below entry, whichever provides tighter downside protection.
- Initial targets: first objective around 236–240 (where resistance/round-number levels intersect with momentum). Consider trailing the stop to breakeven after 240 and progressively higher as the uptrend strengthens.
- Position sizing: deploy gradually rather than full size on the initial reclaim; maintain disciplined risk standards.

Alternative hedges (optional)
- Use protective puts or a small put sleeve to cap downside while awaiting momentum confirmation.
- Or employ a defined-risk call spread to participate in upside with limited risk if you’re inclined toward option strategies.

Monitoring cadence
- Check daily for reclaim of the 10 EMA and 50 SMA; confirm MACD green and RSI in a constructive range.
- Reassess after earnings or major macro updates, as these can trigger momentum shifts.

Final decision
- HOLD now; buy only on a disciplined momentum reclaim with clear confluence on price, trend levels, and momentum indicators.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
