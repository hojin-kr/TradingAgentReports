# Trader Investment Plan

Decision: Hold AMD now. Prepare to escalate to Buy only on clear, credible confirmations.

Rationale
- Near-term setup suggests a pause in the longer-term uptrend: price around 162 with 10-EMA near 166, MACD histogram negative, and RSI ~46. This points to limited upside momentum in the immediate term.
- Long-term bull thesis remains, but catalysts (rack-scale pilots, MI-series adoption, ROCm milestones, cloud/enterprise demand) have not yet produced durable, actionable evidence.
- Therefore, a disciplined, risk-managed Hold is prudent today, with an explicit plan to add on solid confirmations rather than chasing on momentum.

Actionable escalation plan (to Buy)
- Entry triggers to escalate:
  - Price action: close above 166 with a clear follow-through day and above-average volume.
  - Momentum: MACD histogram turns positive and stays there; RSI rises above 50.
  - Price action: reclaim of 166 with a positive volume spike.
- Initial risk controls:
  - If a confirmation occurs, enter gradually (start with a modest increase in exposure) and place tight initial stops (1.0–1.5x ATR below the entry).
- Triggers to defer or trim:
  - If price remains under 166 with MACD negative and RSI sub-50, defer buying or wait for a robust pullback to a structural support (50SMA ~159 or 200SMA ~125) with a fresh confirmation setup.
  - If AMD breaks below the 50SMA on a sustained basis, or shows deteriorating momentum with macro/AI capex risk rising, reduce exposure.

Catalysts to monitor
- Clear rack-scale AI pilots or MI-series deployments with unit economics.
- ROCm milestones: parity improvements, tooling, and developer adoption signals.
- Cloud/provider demand signals: orders, capacity commitments, or partnerships.
- Macro/policy developments impacting AI capex timing and supply chains.

Risk management framework
- ATR-based stops, 1.0–1.5x below entry for new buys.
- Cap exposure: keep AMD within a conservative portion of portfolio risk; reassess at defined intervals.
- Hedging/defined-risk strategies if slightly bullish but awaiting confirmation (e.g., protective puts or spreads).

Final thought
- The plan’s prudent stance is appropriate given current momentum and catalysts. Be prepared to switch to a constructive Buy on clear confirmations; otherwise, remain in a hold posture to protect capital.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
