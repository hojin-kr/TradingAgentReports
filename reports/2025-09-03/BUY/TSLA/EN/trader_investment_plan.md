# Trader Investment Plan

Decision: Hold for now, with a clear buy trigger if a confirmed breakout occurs.

How I’m aligning with the proposed plan
- Current stance: Hold. The strongest near-term upside requires a confirmed breakout above the 200-day moving average with momentum confirming (MACD cross) and price momentum (RSI) sustaining above 50. Those conditions have not yet been met.
- Why not buy now: The stock is flirting with the 200 SMA but has not produced a decisive close above it, and MACD remains shy of a cross while RSI sits around neutral. ATR remains elevated, signaling potential whipsaws around the breakout zone. Entering on a non-confirmed breakout risks a quick pullback.

Activation trigger to buy (if and when all are satisfied on the same close or tight confirmation window)
- Daily close above the 200 SMA (≈329.9) AND MACD crosses above its signal line, AND RSI clearly above 50 on the same close or within a 1–2 session confirmation window.

Risk-managed plan if the trigger hits
- Entry: near the close that satisfies all three conditions.
- Stop: conservative option below the 50-day SMA (≈323.94) or a tight ATR-based stop (entry price minus ~1x ATR, ~317), whichever is tighter. Consider smaller risk if you’re uncomfortable with higher volatility.
- Position sizing: risk 0.5–1% of portfolio per trade. Example: if the per-share risk is $7 and you’re willing to risk $1,000, size ~140 shares (adjust for exact entry/stop levels).
- Targets: primary around 337–340 (near the 10 EMA/resistance region); secondary 350–360 if momentum broadens and volume supports continuation.
- Risk controls and hedging: be mindful of macro events or policy shifts; consider light hedges around those catalysts to protect downside while keeping upside potential.

What to watch and and exit rules
- If price closes back below the 200 SMA with MACD turning down or RSI slipping below 50, reassess and consider exiting or scaling back.
- If the breakout occurs but momentum stalls (no MACD cross or RSI fading), tighten stops and consider partial realization of gains.

Bottom line
- Current stance: HOLD. Ready to switch to BUY on a confirmed breakout with robust multi-factor confirmation. This keeps you out of premature exposure while preserving the upside on a durable move.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
