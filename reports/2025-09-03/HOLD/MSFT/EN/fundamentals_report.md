# Fundamentals Report

I’m ready to proceed, but I need a couple of quick clarifications to fetch the exact data you want:

- Platform for “Fundamental”: which site or source should I target? Please share the URL or exact platform name (e.g., Fundamental.com, a specific forum, etc.). If you don’t have a URL, I can proceed with a general MSFT fundamentals report from standard financial sources, but I want to confirm your preference.
- Date range: do you want August 1, 2025 through September 3, 2025 (inclusive), or a slightly different window? A common choice is the full August 2025 plus up to Sep 3, 2025.
- Scope of “discussions on MSFT”: should I pull every post/thread that mentions MSFT on the platform within the window, or only posts that discuss MSFT fundamentals (e.g., references to P/E, P/S, cash flow, revenue, etc.)?
- Metrics and data approach:
  - Do you want metrics as mentioned in each post, or metrics pulled from a financial data source as of the post date (e.g., trailing P/E, P/S, cash flow figures as of that date)?
  - Which metrics would you like included by default? Common choices: P/E (ttm), P/S (ttm), P/B, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, Revenue, Net Income, Debt/Equity, EBITDA, Dividend Yield. Let me know if you want any others or to exclude some.
- Output format and size:
  - Do you want the results as a Markdown table in-chat, or would you prefer a CSV/Excel export?
  - How many rows should I return? All relevant posts, or a capped number (e.g., top 10 by engagement)?
- Handling gaps:
  - If a post doesn’t cite certain metrics, should I leave those fields blank or infer from the closest available data?

If you’re okay with a default, I can proceed with:
- Date window: August 1, 2025 – September 3, 2025 (inclusive)
- Platform: the exact platform you specify (please provide URL/name) or, if none, I’ll default to a broad public-source approach and clearly cite sources
- Metrics: a core set (P/E, P/S, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow, Revenue, Net Income) plus option to add Debt/Equity and others if available
- Output: a Markdown table here, with an optional CSV export if you want it

Please confirm the platform (URL/name) and the preferred defaults, and I’ll run the fetch and deliver the table with sources.
