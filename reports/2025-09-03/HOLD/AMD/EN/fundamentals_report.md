# Fundamentals Report

Sorry about the hiccup fetching the latest AMD fundamentals with the OpenAI-based feed. I can proceed in two ways:

Option A — Retry the exact fetch
- I’ll retry retrieving AMD fundamentals for the requested date window (the past week, or August 1, 2025 through September 3, 2025, as you specify) and then return a detailed report with citations, including financial metrics if mentioned in posts (P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA, cash flows, etc.), plus a Markdown table at the end.

Option B — Produce a practitioner-focused fundamentals report (no live fetch)
- I’ll compile a comprehensive AMD fundamentals report using AMD’s latest official filings (10-Q/10-K, press releases, investor presentations), analyst coverage, and credible market data up to today. It will cover:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Recent financials and historical trends (revenue, margins, cash flow, capex, R&D)
  - Balance sheet and liquidity (cash, debt, liquidity ratios)
  - Cash flow analysis (OCF, FCF, FCF yield)
  - Segment/geo contributions and AI-cycle exposure
  - Insider sentiment and notable insider transactions (if available)
  - Shareholder metrics (share count, EPS, margins, ROE/ROIC, leverage)
  - Risk factors and catalysts relevant to traders
  - Key takeaways for traders with a concise action-oriented table

If you want me to proceed right away, please choose Option A or Option B. Also, please confirm:
- Exact date window: is the window Aug 1, 2025 through Sep 3, 2025 (inclusive) or a different 7–14 day window?
- Output format: Markdown table is fine, or would you also like CSV?
- Currency basis: USD, with per-share values where applicable?

Once you confirm, I’ll deliver the full report. If you’d like me to retry Option A immediately, I’ll run that and present the results with a Markdown table at the end.
