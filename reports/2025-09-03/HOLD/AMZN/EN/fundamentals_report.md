# Fundamentals Report

I hit a bug plotting the fundamentals fetch tool for AMZN (AttributeError in the OpenAI fundamentals call). I attempted retries, but the tool remains unavailable right now. I can still move forward in a couple of ways:

Options to proceed
1) Best-effort high-level overview (no new live data): I’ll compile a comprehensive qualitative fundamentals brief for AMZN based on publicly reported structure (segments, margins, cash flows, balance sheet, capital allocation, insider activity trends, etc.) using the latest generally known patterns up to mid-2025. I won’t include fresh numbers unless you’re okay with me citing SEC filings/press releases from memory or requesting permission to fetch them manually from official sources.

2) Retry fetch now or shortly: I can try the tool again, or you can confirm you’d like me to retry in a few minutes. If it works, I’ll generate a data-rich report with exact metrics (PE, PS, P/B, Revenue, Net Income, Cash Flow, Debt, etc.) and an insider/transactions section.

3) Switch to an alternative data flow: I can pull from SEC filings (10-Q/10-K), earnings press releases, and major financial portals to assemble a robust fundamentals snapshot, then annotate sources. This may take a bit longer but will be solid.

What I’ll deliver in any case
- A comprehensive fundamentals report for AMZN, including:
  - Company profile and segments (e.g., AWS, Retail, Advertising, Other)
  - Revenue by segment and growth trends
  - Profitability (gross margin, operating margin, net margin)
  - Cash flow (CFO, FCF) and capital expenditures
  - Balance sheet highlights (cash, debt, minority interests, intangible assets)
  - Liquidity and leverage metrics
  - Historical financial performance (multi-year view)
  - Valuation context (multiples where applicable)
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions overview
  - Key catalysts and risk factors
  - A concise interpretation for traders (how the fundamentals may interact with current price action)

Report format you’ll get
- A detailed narrative analysis
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points (see template below)

Markdown table template to be appended
- Columns: Date / Metric / Value / Source / Notes
- Example rows (placeholders until we fill in actual data):
  - Date: 2025-06-30, Revenue, Value: N/A, Source: SEC/Company, Notes: Last reported quarterly revenue
  - Date: 2025-06-30, Net Income, Value: N/A, Source: SEC/Company, Notes: Net income for the quarter
  - Date: 2025-06-30, Operating Margin, Value: N/A, Source: Company filings, Notes: Operating profitability
  - Date: 2025-06-30, FCF, Value: N/A, Source: Cash flow statement, Notes: Free cash flow
  - Date: 2025-06-30, Cash & Equivalents, Value: N/A, Source: Balance sheet, Notes: Liquidity
  - Date: 2025-06-30, Total Debt, Value: N/A, Source: Balance sheet, Notes: Leverage
  - Date: 2025-06-30, P/E (if applicable), Value: N/A, Source: Market data, Notes: Valuation multiple
  - Date: 2025-06-30, Insider Sentiment, Value: N/A, Source: Insider filings/news, Notes: Net buys/sells

Next step: how would you like me to proceed?
- If you’re okay with it, I can do option 1 (best-effort qualitative snapshot) now and clearly label any data that would benefit from a precise numeric pull once the tool is back.
- Or tell me to retry the fundamentals fetch now, and I’ll attempt another run as soon as possible.

Additionally, if you have a preferred data window (e.g., latest quarterly data and year-to-date 2025) or specific metrics you care about beyond PE, PS, P/B, cash flow, revenue, and net income, tell me and I’ll tailor the report accordingly.
