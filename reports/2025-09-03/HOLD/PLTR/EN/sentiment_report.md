# Sentiment Report

I ran into an error calling the PLTR news tool: AttributeError: 'ResponseFunctionWebSearch' object has no attribute 'content'. I’ll outline my plan and what I can do right now, plus what I’ll deliver as soon as the tool issue is resolved.

What I can do now
- Acknowledge the tool hiccup and avoid guessing. I won’t fabricate sentiment or news data.
- Prepare a detailed plan for the full long-form report so we can hit the ground running as soon as the news data fetch works again.
- Provide a clean, ready-to-fill structure (with a placeholder table) so you can review the approach and approve it.

What I’ll deliver once the data tool is working
- A comprehensive long report analyzing:
  - Daily social sentiment about PLTR over the past week from social media (volume, polarity, major topics).
  - Key news items in the last week (earnings, product updates, partnerships, regulatory or policy shifts, geopolitical/commercial impact).
  - Contextual trader implications: catalysts, risks, potential price drivers, and sentiment-to-price mapping indicators.
  - Thematic insights (e.g., government/AI/go-to-market dynamics, competitive positioning) with fine-grained takeaways for traders.
- A Markdown-formatted table at the end summarizing key points.

Plan for the report structure (to be filled with real data once the tool works)
- Executive snapshot: PLTR price context, sentiment temperature, notable catalysts.
- Social sentiment analysis (by day, last 7 days)
  - Day-by-day sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral)
  - Dominant themes per day
  - Notable spikes tied to headlines or events
- News & events overview (last 7 days)
  - Headlines, sources, and quick takeaways
  - Implications for revenue growth, product adoption, and customer mix
- Sentiment vs. price implications
  - How sentiment shifts could influence near-term moves (intraday/1-2 weeks)
  - Risk factors (regulatory, competition, execution risk)
- Trader-friendly takeaways
  - Key catalysts to watch
  - Scenarios with probability estimates (bullish, neutral, bearish)
  - Suggested positions or risk management notes
- Appendix: data notes, sources, and methodology

Proposed Markdown table template (to be populated with data)
- Date | Source | Headline / Topic | Sentiment (Pos/Neu/Neg) | Key Takeaway | Potential Price Impact
- (Fill for each major item in the week)

Would you like me to retry the PLTR news data fetch now and proceed with the full analysis once the tool returns data? If you prefer, I can also proceed with the outlined template and placeholders immediately, and fill in the exact numbers as soon as the tool issue is resolved.
