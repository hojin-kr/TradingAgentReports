# Trader Investment Plan

Recommendation: HOLD

Rationale
- Near-term setup remains weak: price around 157, below the 10-EMA (~160), MACD negative, and RSI ~45. This supports a continuation of consolidation rather than an immediate breakout.
- Risk-reward favors patience: a clean momentum reversal or reclaim of key levels (10-EMA or above 169) is needed to justify new capital deployment.
- Bull thesis intact on a multi-quarter horizon, but catalysts for non-government revenue and international expansion are not yet delivering a clear near-term trigger.
- The plan to re-enter on confirmed momentum (reclaim 10-EMA with MACD upturn and volume, followed by a close above 169) remains prudent. Until those triggers fire, capital should stay on the sidelines or be allocated only to a very small, tactical position.

Concrete next steps
- Maintain watchlist: monitor Trigger A (reclaim of 10-EMA around 160 with MACD turning positive and rising volume) and Trigger B (close above 169 with sustained strength).
- If triggers fire, consider staged entries with strict risk controls (e.g., stop below 156) and predefined tranche sizing.
- If downside breaks below 156 on high volume, reassess for potential hedging or reduced exposure.

Exit considerations
- If momentum fails to revert within a defined window, or if macro/stock-specific catalysts disappoint, be prepared to reduce exposure or stay flat until clearer signals emerge.

Final transaction proposal: HOLD
