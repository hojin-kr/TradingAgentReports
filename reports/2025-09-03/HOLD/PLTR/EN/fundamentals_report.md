# Fundamentals Report

I can move forward, but I need to settle a couple of defaults to fetch the data properly. Here’s a proposed plan with sensible defaults. If you approve or tweak them, I’ll proceed and provide the table and insights.

Proposed defaults (can be adjusted)
- Date window: August 1, 2025 through September 3, 2025 (inclusive)
- Platform: Fundamental site (assumed Fundamental.com-type source unless you specify a URL)
- Data scope: Per-post snapshot for PLTR discussions in that window
  - For each post: post date, title/URL, and the metrics shown on the page
  - Metrics to include (if available on the page): P/E (trailing or forward as shown), P/S, cash flow from operations, revenue, EBITDA (if present), net income
  - Source/site name noted per row
- Handling missing data: leave blank or mark as "not available" in that cell
- Output format: Markdown table in chat; also a concise summary analysis
- Appendix: A final Markdown table listing key data points and a short note on data availability

What I’ll deliver
- A detailed, fine-grained table of PLTR discussions in the window with the metrics shown on each post
- A short sentiment/insight note where applicable (e.g., posts highlighting strong/weak fundamentals, any outlier data points)
- A compact summary table of key points at the end

Please confirm:
- Use Aug 1, 2025 – Sep 3, 2025 as the window? Or provide exact start/end dates
- Is Fundamental.com the intended platform, or do you have a specific URL/site in mind?
- Are you happy with per-post snapshots (not a consolidated company-wide snapshot) and the listed metrics? Any additional fields you want included or excluded?

If you confirm the defaults, I’ll proceed with that approach and return the table plus the insights.
