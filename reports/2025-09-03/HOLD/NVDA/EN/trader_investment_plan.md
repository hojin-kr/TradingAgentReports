# Trader Investment Plan

Recommendation: Hold NVDA for now.

Rationale
- The near-term setup shows momentum fatigue and valuation risk, with MACD headwinds and a RSI below 50 currently. This supports a cautious stance rather than adding aggressively.
- The bull case remains intact over a longer horizon (AI infrastructure leadership, strong data-center demand, and a durable CUDA/software moat), but prices have priced in a strong AI growth trajectory. A clean re-acceleration signal is needed to justify heavier risk exposure.
- Concrete risks include macro headwinds, policy/export-control volatility, and competition, which could pressure near-term upside if catalysts disappoint.

Implementation plan (base, with conditional add-on)
- Current stance: Hold NVDA; reassess only on clear technical confirmation.
- Entry/engagement trigger for a small long tilt (optional): daily close above 171 with a bullish MACD cross and RSI above 50.
- Position sizing (if you choose to add on confirmation): 0.5% to 1% of portfolio as a cautious tilt, not a full allocation.
- Risk controls: ATR-based stop around 2x the latest swing low; if NVDA closes below the 200-day SMA (~138) on sustained negative momentum, liquidate.
- Target and exit approach: consider a partial take near 179–180 on initial momentum; reassess for a move toward 190–210 only if AI demand narrative remains intact and macro backdrop stabilizes. If breakout fails (no follow-through after reclaiming 171), exit the small add-on and stay flat.
- Hedging and diversification: keep most of the portfolio in non-NVDA assets or low-volatility tech; consider a light hedge only if you’ve already taken a sizable NVDA position.

Key levels and catalysts to monitor
- Resistance: around 171 (breakout level); 179–180 as near-term resistance.
- Support: 171 and then the 200-day SMA near 138 as longer-term guardrails.
- Catalysts: upcoming guidance, data-center order trends, hyperscaler capex, macro rate trajectory, and policy/geopolitical developments impacting export controls.

Bottom-line note
- The most defensible stance today is to stay patient and disciplined. You may participate only on a confirmed breakout with strict risk controls; otherwise, maintain a guarded stance and avoid forced exposure.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
