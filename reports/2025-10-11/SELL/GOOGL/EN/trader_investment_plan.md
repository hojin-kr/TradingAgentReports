Decision: SELL (reduce exposure) to Alphabet (GOOGL) and implement a hedged, staged exit, using a disciplined risk-managed plan as outlined.

Rationale
- Bear case alignment: Regulatory overhang remains persistent and costly to monetize; Gemini monetization is a multi-year ramp with uncertain ROI; cloud margins face competitive pressure and capital intensity; ad cycle sensitivity and privacy shifts continue to cap near-term upside.
- Valuation and timing risk: Even with AI monetization potential, the combination of high expectations and structural risks supports a cautious stance versus loading full long exposure.
- Optionality preserved through hedging: The plan’s hedges allow participation if catalysts prove durable while limiting downside during continued uncertainty.

Recommended execution steps
1) Trim exposure now
- Reduce GOOGL allocation by 25–50% of your current position to lower beta while preserving optionality for future re-entry.

2) Implement hedges to manage downside
- Option-based hedge: Buy long-dated puts (6–12 months out) with strikes around 5–15% below the current price, sized to cover roughly 50–75% of the post-trim remaining exposure.
- Cost-efficient alternative: Use a collar (long puts 6–12 months out, 5–10% in-the-money or near-the-money; financed by selling calls around the money with similar tenor). This caps upside but minimizes net cost.

3) Set risk controls and triggers
- Hard stop: If price falls 15–20% from the post-trim level, re-evaluate and consider additional protective action.
- Re-entry trigger: Only add back to full long exposure after clear catalysts (e.g., Gemini monetization milestones with tangible ARR/Upsell signals, credible cloud margin improvement, or regulatory clarity) and with evidence from multiple data points.

4) Monitor catalysts and data points
- Gemini monetization progress (enterprise adoption, cross-sell metrics, pricing power).
- Cloud margins and competitive pricing dynamics; capex intensity.
- Regulatory developments and potential remedies; their impact on monetization tempo.

5) Liquidity and process discipline
- Maintain sufficient dry powder to respond to material downside or a meaningful positive catalyst.
- Schedule a periodic (e.g., monthly or quarterly) risk-reward reassessment aligned to earnings, regulatory updates, and Gemini/cloud milestones.

Learning and approach
- Do not rely on a single positive datapoint; triangulate AI monetization, cloud economics, and ad dynamics with regulatory risk.
- Treat regulatory headlines as persistent risk; hedge accordingly.
- Demand milestone-driven evidence for upside before increasing exposure; use staged exposure and options to manage risk.
