Thanks for the update. It looks like the Reddit stock info tool is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError, which suggests a backend issue rather than an input problem.

I can do one of two things:
- Retry now: I’ll attempt the Reddit data fetch again for GOOGL on 2025-10-11 and, if it succeeds, proceed with a full sentiment-and-news analysis covering the past week.
- If you prefer, I can pause and run a broader plan once the Reddit tool is up again, or proceed with a structured analysis framework using other sources you might provide.

Would you like me to retry now or wait a bit before attempting again? If you’d like, I can also proceed with the following plan in parallel (once Reddit data is available) and deliver a comprehensive report with a Markdown table summary at the end:

Proposed report outline (to be filled in once we have data)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment trend for GOOGL over the past week based on Reddit posts and public sentiment signals
- Daily sentiment breakdown: day-by-day sentiment scores, notable spikes, and potential catalysts
- Top themes and topics: recurring discussions (AI developments, regulatory concerns, stock splits, leadership commentary, etc.)
- Correlation with company news: summarize relevant Google/Alphabet news in the same period and how it aligns with sentiment
- Event-driven analysis: earnings calls, product launches, regulatory updates, antitrust developments, major partnerships
- Risk signals for traders: cautionary themes, potential overhangs, media tone shifts
- Sentiment vs. price action: any observed divergences or confirmations
- Practical takeaways for traders: actionable insights (short-term catalysts, risk management considerations)
- Appendix: data sources, methodology, and limitations
- Makrdown table: key points, catalysts, sentiment direction, and implied implications

If you’re happy with that plan, I’ll retry the Reddit data fetch now and then proceed with the full report once I have the data.
