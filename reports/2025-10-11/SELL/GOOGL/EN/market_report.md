Thanks for the ticker: GOOGL.

What happened with data retrieval
- I attempted to fetch Yahoo Finance data for GOOGL (2024-10-11 to 2025-10-11) but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I retried, but the issue persisted.
- This means I can’t run the indicator calculations right this moment. If you’d like, I can retry the data pull now, or proceed with a detailed plan and a framework you can apply once the data loads.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
I’m selecting these to give a well-rounded view of trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context. They balance readability with actionable signals.

1) close_50_sma
- What it measures: Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance.
- Why include: Helps confirm the broader trend (with 200 SMA) and filters signals from faster indicators.

2) close_200_sma
- What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark; macro context (golden/death cross potential).
- Why include: Crucial for bias confirmation and strategic viewpoint.

3) close_10_ema
- What it measures: Short-term momentum; quick shifts in price.
- Why include: Signals near-term momentum shifts that may precede longer-term moves; useful for entries when used with longer-term SMA.

4) macd
- What it measures: Momentum via MACD line vs signal line; trend-change signals via crossovers/divergences.
- Why include: Core momentum signal; complements price action and trend lines.

5) macdh
- What it measures: MACD histogram; momentum strength.
- Why include: Helps gauge the strength of moves and early divergences beyond MACD crossovers.

6) rsi
- What it measures: Relative momentum; overbought/oversold levels.
- Why include: Identifies potential reversals and divergences; easier to interpret across markets.

7) boll
- What it measures: Bollinger Middle (20-day SMA) as a volatility-adjusted baseline.
- Why include: Provides a dynamic context for price deviation from the baseline; sets stage for breakouts or mean reversion.

8) vwma
- What it measures: Volume-weighted moving average; price action filtered by volume.
- Why include: Confirms price moves with volume, reducing false signals in low-volume periods.

How to interpret and use (framework you can apply once data loads)
- Trend confirmation:
  - If price is above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma, bias is bullish; look for long-entry signals.
  - Watch for a golden cross (close_50_sma crossing above close_200_sma) as a stronger bullish cue; a death cross is the opposite.
- Momentum signals:
  - macd and macdh: Bulls confirm when MACD line crosses above the signal and the histogram expands positively; bears vice versa.
  - RSI: Look for momentum-driven exits when RSI hits extreme levels (e.g., >70 or <30) but always confirm with trend signals to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- Volatility context:
  - boll: Price behavior around the Bollinger Middle can indicate consolidation or breakout pressure. Tightening bands suggest imminent breakout; expanding bands indicate higher volatility.
- Volume-confirmed moves:
  - vwma: Price staying above VWMA with rising VWMA implies volume-supported uptrend; price above VWMA with declining VWMA could signal weakness or a squeeze.

Next steps
- I can reattempt the data pull now to compute the indicators and provide a detailed trend report with a live interpretation once data is available.
- If you prefer, I can also proceed with a provisional qualitative framework (as above) and fill in real-time signals as soon as the data loads.

Appendix: Key points table (indicator references)
| Indicator | What it measures | Trading insight / use case |
| - | - | - |
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average (mid-term trend) | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; use with 200 SMA for cross signals |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average (long-term trend) | Long-term bias; watch for golden/death cross with 50 SMA |
| close_10_ema | 10-period exponential moving average (short-term momentum) | Quick momentum shifts; useful with longer-term filters |
| macd | MACD line vs signal line; momentum crossover signals | Core momentum/ trend-change signals; confirm with other indicators |
| macdh | MACD histogram; momentum strength | Divergence and momentum strength insights beyond crossovers |
| rsi | Relative strength index; overbought/oversold | Reversal potential and divergence signals; use with trend context |
| boll | Bollinger Middle (20-SMA) baseline | Baseline for volatility context; watch for breakouts around bands |
| vwma | Volume-weighted moving average | Volume-confirmed price moves; filters signals during low liquidity |
