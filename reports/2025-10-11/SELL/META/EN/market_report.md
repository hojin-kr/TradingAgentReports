I attempted to fetch META data and compute the requested indicators, but the data tool returned a backend file-not-found error. I can retry the data pull or adjust parameters (date range, etc.). In the meantime, here is a prepared, actionable indicator setup and a detailed plan for META, along with a structured interpretation framework you can use once the data is available.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these eight are suitable
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages): Provides the medium-term trend direction and acts as a dynamic support/resistance. Useful for filtering entries in META’s price swings and aligning trades with the prevailing trend.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages): Long-term trend benchmark. Helps identify whether META is in a broader uptrend or downtrend and can confirm “golden/death cross” style signals when combined with shorter averages.
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages): A responsive short-term line to capture momentum shifts and potential entry points. Helps detect quicker reversals in META’s high-momentum environment.
- macd (MACD): Momentum indicator based on EMA differences; crossovers signal potential trend changes. Useful to spot shifts in META’s momentum, especially around earnings or major news.
- macds (MACD Signal): Smoothing of MACD; provides cleaner entry/exit signals when MACD crosses its signal line.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Visualizes momentum strength and divergence. Helpful to identify accelerating or waning momentum, complementing MACD and RSI signals.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum measure with typical overbought/oversold thresholds (70/30). Divergence with price can signal reversals; in META, RSI can help flag exhaustion in rallies or declines in high-volatility periods.
- atr (ATR): Measures volatility to inform risk management and stop placement. Important for META given earnings-driven moves and sector volatility; helps size positions and adjust stops relative to current volatility.

How to interpret and apply (once data is available)
- Trend framework
  - Price > 50_sma and price > 200_sma: bullish context; pullbacks toward the 50_sma can be considered potential entries if momentum indicators align.
  - Price < 50_sma or price < 200_sma: bearish context; look for resistance around the moving averages and possible trend reversals only with stronger confirmation (MACD, RSI).
  - Golden cross (50_sma crossing above 200_sma) or death cross (50_sma crossing below 200_sma) can anchor longer-term bias but should be confirmed with MACD and RSI.
- Momentum and signals
  - MACD line cross above MACD signal: bullish momentum cue; cross below indicates bearish momentum.
  - MACD histogram rising (macdh positive and increasing): strengthening bullish momentum; falling histogram indicates weakening momentum.
  - RSI above 70 may indicate overbought in a strong uptrend; RSI below 30 may indicate oversold in a downtrend. Divergences between RSI and price can flag reversals, particularly around meta catalysts.
- Volatility and risk
  - ATR rising suggests increasing volatility; adjust position sizing and stop distance accordingly to avoid outsized risk on news events tied to META.
  - In high-volatility regimes, rely more on MACD/macd-histogram cues in conjunction with price interaction with the moving averages to avoid whipsaws.

Next steps
- I can retry the data retrieval now with the same parameters or I can adjust to a shorter window (e.g., last 12 months) or a different end date to improve the chance of a successful fetch. Please tell me:
  - Do you want me to retry the data pull as-is?
  - Or would you prefer I fetch a shorter window (e.g., 2024-10-11 to 2025-10-11 or 2025-01-01 to 2025-10-11) to test connectivity?
- Once data is retrieved, I will generate the indicator values for META and provide:
  - A detailed trend and momentum assessment
  - Interpretations aligned with the 8-indicator setup
  - Practical trade ideas and risk considerations
  - A final summarized table of key observations

Key points at a glance (indicator rationale)
- Trend: 50_sma, 200_sma, 10_ema
- Momentum: macd, macds, macdh, rsi
- Volatility: atr
- Goal: Complementary signals to filter entries, confirm trend, and manage risk in META’s volatile environment

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and interpretation guide

| Indicator      | Category            | Purpose / What it tells you                                 | How to interpret for META context |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma   | Moving Averages     | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance   | Price above suggests bullish bias; use as a trend filter and potential pullback support; price below suggests caution |
| close_200_sma  | Moving Averages     | Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation                   | Price above supports long-term uptrend bias; cross above/below 200SMA can signal sustained trend shift |
| close_10_ema   | Moving Averages     | Short-term momentum shifts                                    | Quick signals; use with longer averages to filter noise; breakouts around 10-EMA can indicate near-term entries |
| macd           | MACD                | Momentum shifts via EMA differences                             | MACD line crossing above/below signal indicates potential trend change; stronger when corroborated by MACD histogram |
| macds          | MACD Signal         | Smoothing of MACD; clearer entry/exit signals                   | Crosses with MACD line trigger signals; use with overall trend for reliability |
| macdh          | MACD Histogram      | Momentum strength; divergence signals                             | Increasing positive bars imply growing bullish momentum; decreasing bars imply waning momentum |
| rsi            | Momentum            | Overbought/oversold conditions; momentum strength                | RSI >70 may indicate overbought in uptrends; RSI <30 may indicate oversold in downtrends; watch for divergences |
| atr            | Volatility          | Current market volatility; risk management and stop placement    | Higher ATR means wider stops; adjust position sizing and stop distance; useful around catalysts (earnings, product launches) |

Notes
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry immediately and then deliver a full, data-driven interpretation once the data is retrieved. Just confirm, and I’ll run the fetch again and then provide the detailed indicator analysis for META.
