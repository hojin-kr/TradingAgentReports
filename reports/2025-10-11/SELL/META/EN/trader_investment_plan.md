Analytical view and decision
- The comprehensive plan you provided emphasizes durable headwinds for META: persistent regulatory/ad-measurement costs, ad-market softness, and substantial cash outlays for metaverse/hardware. While the bull case (AI monetization, global reach, creator ecosystem expansion) is plausible, it rests on multiple optimistic assumptions that may not materialize in a timely or proportional fashion. Given the balance of risks and potential downside catalysts, a defensive stance is warranted.

Decision
- Primary stance: SELL or hedge META now. If you are already long, trim aggressively and implement hedges; if you are new to META, avoid building a large long exposure and favor risk-managed strategies.

Rationale (condensed)
- Durable headwinds: regulatory costs and privacy/ad-measurement constraints persist.
- Demand/monetization risk: ad-market softness and potential margin compression from ongoing structural changes.
- Cash-burn risk: metaverse/hardware bets add near-term downside risk if ROI is slower to materialize.
- Upside optionality exists but requires multiple favorable outcomes aligning, which is less certain than the downside risk.

Concrete action plan
- If you currently hold META:
  - Step 1: Trim exposure by 40–60% to reduce beta and preserve capital.
  - Step 2: Implement a protective hedge on the remainder to guard against gap-downs (see hedging options below).
  - Step 3: Rebalance quarterly and reassess as earnings, regulatory updates, and AI milestones approach.
- If you are establishing a position:
  - Do not build a large long core right now. If you must participate, use hedges and a capped-risk approach rather than a big unhedged long.
  - Favor hedged constructs over outright long exposure:
    - Protective put: buy long-dated puts (out-of-the-money) with delta around -0.3 to -0.5 to cap downside while preserving some upside.
    - Collar: long META stock with a protective put and a short call at a higher strike to offset put cost.
    - Bearish risk-reversal or bear put spread to cap upfront cost and define downside.
- Hedging specifics (structure flexible, price-dependent):
  - Protective hedge: 3–6 month puts with delta roughly -0.3 to -0.5.
  - Bear put spread: buy an ATM/OTM put and sell a lower-strike put to reduce cost and cap losses.
  - Collar: long META with protective put and short higher-strike call to finance the hedge, ensuring position sizing remains constrained.
- Stop-loss and risk controls:
  - Use ATR-based stops for any remaining long exposure; initial stops at ~1.5–2x ATR below current price, then trail.
  - Limit single-position risk to 1–2% of portfolio, especially when hedged.
- Catalysts to monitor:
  - Earnings: guidance on ad impressions, ARPU, and cost structure.
  - Regulatory developments: EU settlements, DMA developments, data-privacy shifts and margin implications.
  - AI/compute milestones: data-center efficiency, monetization signals from AI initiatives, hardware (Ray-Ban/Quest) ROI versus burn.
- Data/indicator plan:
  - When the eight-indicator feed returns, re-run trend/momentum/volatility assessments. If price clears key moving averages with positive momentum, you may re-evaluate hedges; otherwise, maintain defensiveness.

Risk management reflections
- Avoid anchoring on a single catalyst (AI upside). Use scenario planning (base/bear/bull) to guard against overconfidence.
- Maintain disciplined risk controls (size, hedges, stops) rather than chasing headlines.
- Decision criterion remains risk-adjusted reward; the current stance leans toward defensiveness and hedged exposure.

Final note
- The recommended stance is defensive with hedges to preserve capital and maintain optionality to participate later if catalysts improve and risk signals shift decisively.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
