# Daily Trading Intelligence: META

## Executive Snapshot
- Core driver: AI-enabled ad stack and multilingual tools (translation/dubbing) expanding global reach; Ray-Ban Display as a monetization gateway for AI experiences.
- Key risk: Regulatory scrutiny (EU/US DMA settlements, antitrust activity), plus youth safety and data-privacy lawsuits; regime risk remains a material price driver.

- Infrastructure backdrop: Ongoing data-center and subsea-cable expansion (Waterworth) supports global compute for AI workloads; energy and capex considerations remain near-term margin risk.
