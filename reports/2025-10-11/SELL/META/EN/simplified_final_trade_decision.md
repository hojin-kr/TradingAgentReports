# Investment Report: META
## Executive Summary
META faces durable headwinds from regulation, ad-market softness, iOS/privacy changes, and metaverse cash burn. The stock trades at a premium and could miss earnings; a hedged, trimmed approach is advised.

## Investment Decision
Sell now. Trim aggressively or hedge; avoid new long exposure. Confidence: High.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Durable headwinds threaten near-term profits: regulation costs, softer ad demand, privacy changes, and metaverse hardware cash burn.
- AI upside could help, but it needs favorable timing, scale, and regulatory clarity; downside risks remain larger than near-term upside.
- Valuation already reflects optimistic outcomes; without clear catalysts, the risk of earnings misses or negative regulatory events remains meaningful.

## Risks To Watch
- Regulatory costs and data/privacy rules affecting ads and measurement.
- Ad-market softness and slower overall demand.
- Cash burn from metaverse hardware investments.
- Uncertainty around AI monetization outcomes and regulatory clarity.
- Possible earnings surprises or adverse regulatory rulings that could push the stock lower.
