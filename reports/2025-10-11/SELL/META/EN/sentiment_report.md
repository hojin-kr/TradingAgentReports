I attempted to pull Reddit sentiment data for META across the requested dates, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all calls. It looks like the Reddit data source is currently unavailable in this environment. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

Options
- Retry now or on a cadence until the tool is available.
- Use alternative sources or a qualitative approach based on META’s latest public news and known market sentiment signals (without Reddit data).
- Wait for you to provide data or allow me to pull from other connected sources if you have them.

What I can deliver right now
- A detailed report framework outlining what I would analyze, what signals to look for, and how to interpret them for META, with a ready-to-fill Markdown table template at the end.
- Once the Reddit tool becomes available (or you provide data from another source), I will complete the filled-in report with day-by-day sentiment, key themes, and price/signal implications.

Proposed report structure (to fill with data when available)
- Executive summary: Key sentiment posture over the past week, notable catalysts, and the implications for short- to medium-term traders.
- Daily sentiment synthesis: Meta-analysis of Reddit posts (volume, positivity/negativity, dominant themes) by day.
- News catalysts: Summary of recent company announcements, regulatory updates, earnings signals, product launches, or competitive developments.
- Thematic sentiment breakdown: AI/ads/privacy/regulatory concerns, Metaverse/VR initiatives, Threads ecosystem, earnings guidance, supplier/advertiser signals.
- Behavioral signals: Coordinated activity, upvoted posts, influential posters, discussion spikes, sentiment skew vs. price moves.
- Risk and catalysts for traders: Potential short-term catalysts (product launches, regulatory news, ad market commentary), and longer-term structural risks.
- Quant framework: How sentiment aligns with price action, implied volatility hints, and volume spikes.
- Takeaways and trading implications: Short-term posture (buy/hold/sell considerations) and risk controls.

Markdown table template (to be populated with data)
| Date | Reddit Sentiment (Mood) | Top Themes | Notable Posts / Threads | News Catalyst | Price Move (intraday estimate) | Market Signal / Confidence |
|------|-------------------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 2025-10-11 | [Positive/Neutral/Negative] | [Theme1; Theme2] | [Post1 summary; Post2 summary] | [Headline or event] | [↑/↓ or flat, estimate] | [Low/Medium/High confidence] |
| 2025-10-10 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2025-10-09 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2025-10-08 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2025-10-07 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2025-10-06 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2025-10-05 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Next steps
- Tell me how you’d like to proceed:
  1) I retry the Reddit data pull now (in hopes the tool comes back online).
  2) I switch to a qualitative/alternative-data-only report based on META’s latest public news and non-Reddit sentiment signals (I’ll explicitly note data sources and limitations).
  3) You provide data from another source and I’ll integrate it into the same report format.

If you’d like me to proceed with option 1 (retry now), say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt the Reddit pull again and then deliver the full long-form report with the Markdown table populated. If you prefer option 2 or 3, specify which direction and I’ll start accordingly.
