Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to pull the latest quarterly balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, insider sentiment, and insider transactions for AMD (AMD) as of 2025-10-11, but the data retrieval layer returned FileNotFoundError errors. I retried a couple of times, but the tool calls still failed. Because of that, I don’t have fresh numeric figures to report yet. I’ll outline a comprehensive fundamental report structure you can fill in once the data sources come back online, and I’ll provide guidance on how to interpret and act on those data points.

What I can deliver now
- A detailed framework for AMD’s fundamentals, with emphasis on what traders typically care about.
- Guidance on how to interpret insider sentiment and insider transactions once those data points are available.
- A Markdown table at the end to organize key points, ready to populate with the data you retrieve.

Company profile (AMD)
- Overview: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. designs and produces high-performance computing, graphics, and AI accelerators. Core segments include Computing and Graphics (CPG) and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EECS). AMD competes with players like Intel in CPUs and Nvidia in GPUs, with AI and datacenter demand as a primary growth driver.
- Strategy: Focus areas typically include expanding data center penetration, advancing high-performance computing (HPC) GPUs, accelerating AI workloads, and maintaining a mix of product cycles (CPU/GPU) to balance ASP (average selling price) and volume. Competitive dynamics include lithography advances, supply chain efficiency, and ecosystem partnerships (cloud/HPC customers, software stack optimization).

What to capture in a fundamental analysis (data you’ll want to pull)
1) Income statement (quarterly and year-to-date)
   - Revenue by segment (CPG vs EECS) and total revenue
   - Gross margin, operating margin, net margin
   - R&D, SG&A margins as a share of revenue
   - Non-operating items and tax rate
   - Earnings per share (GAAP and non-GAAP)

2) Balance sheet (latest quarter)
   - Liquidity: cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities
   - Working capital and current ratio
   - Debt levels: total debt, long-term debt, maturities
   - Shareholder equity and share count (dilution vs. buybacks)

3) Cash flow
   - Operating cash flow, free cash flow
   - Capex intensity and maintenance vs. growth capex
   - Cash used in investing and financing activities
   - Debt repayments or issuances

4) Financial history and trends
   - Revenue trend (quarterly y/y and q/q)
   - Margin trends (gross, operating, net)
   - Margin expansion/contracting signals
   - Leverage and liquidity evolution over the past 4–8 quarters

5) Insider sentiment and insider transactions
   - Insider buying vs. selling intensity (net activity, not just counts)
   - Context: size of trades, whether they align with earnings cycles, or reflect confidence in strategic initiatives
   - Any unusual option activity or large acquisitions by insiders
   - Correlation with stock moves post-announcements or guidance

6) Company profile and market context
   - Product cycles and supply chain status (fabs capacity, foundry relationships)
   - AI/datacenter demand trajectory and mix (e.g., server GPU demand)
   - Competitive positioning and pricing power
   - Macro risks: cyclical semis demand, PC demand cycles, supply chain disruptions

Interpreting insider data (how to read sentiment and transactions)
- Positive signals: new large insider purchases, sustained insider buying near earnings or guidance upticks, rising insider ownership proportion.
- Negative signals: large or accelerating insider selling, option exercises without corresponding price strength, concentration of sales by a small number of insiders.
- Context matters: compare insider moves to earnings beats/mits, guidance changes, product launches, or major capex announcements.

What to do with the data (trader-centric insights)
- If revenue and margins show improving trend with strong cash flow and low leverage, AMD could be in a period of fundamental strengthening, supporting risk-on sentiment around AI datacenter demand.
- If the balance sheet shows healthy liquidity and improving free cash flow but insider selling is elevated, investigate whether insiders are reallocating within the sector or whether external factors (e.g., debt refinancing needs) are driving the sales.
- If AI/datacenter demand remains robust and AMD maintains competitive pricing power, the stock could tolerate multiple expansions on AI-driven growth scenarios.
- Watch for risk factors: cyclicality of PC cycle, foundry/production constraints, NAND/AI compute demand shifts, and competition with Nvidia and Intel.

Proposed next steps (when data sources return)
1) Pull the latest quarterly/annual numbers:
   - Income statement: revenue by segment, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS (GAAP and non-GAAP)
   - Balance sheet: cash, debt, working capital, equity, shares outstanding
   - Cash flow: operating cash flow, free cash flow, capex
2) Pull insider data:
   - Insider sentiment report (past 15 days)
   - Insider transactions (past 15 days)
3) Synthesize:
   - Compare sequential and year-over-year changes
   - Map margins and cash flow to product cycles and AI demand tailwinds
   - Align insider signals with price action and earnings guidance
4) Produce a final report with a data-backed assessment and a clear risk-adjusted view for traders.

Appendix: Markdown table for key points
You can populate this table once you have the data. I’ve included the column structure and example rows you can fill in.

If you’d like, I can:
- Retry the data pulls now and report back with numbers as soon as the data layer responds.
- Or proceed with a qualitative AMD-focused write-up using the structural framework above, plus placeholders to be filled in once data is available.

Would you prefer I retry the data retrieval now, or would you like me to proceed with a fully qualitative draft that you can fill in with the data once the tools come back online?
