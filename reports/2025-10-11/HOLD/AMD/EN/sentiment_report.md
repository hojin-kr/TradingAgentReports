I tried to fetch the AMD Reddit sentiment data for Oct 11 and the prior dates you listed, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all requested dates. It looks like the data-fetching tool is currently unavailable or misconfigured at the moment.

What I can do next
- Retry now for the latest date (2025-10-11). If that still fails, I’ll proceed with a fallback approach.
- Use a fallback data source if you’re able to provide one (e.g., links to Reddit threads, or permission to pull sentiment from other sources like X/Twitter, StockTwits, or other public feeds). I can also work with a manual summary you supply and integrate it into the report.
- Produce the long-form AMD sentiment and news analysis once we have data, with actionable insights for traders and investors, including a day-by-day sentiment breakdown, key themes, and risk/opp signals. I will also append a Markdown table at the end to organize the main points.

Proposed plan if you’re okay with a fallback
- Step 1: Gather sources
  - Reddit: AMD-specific discussion and subreddits (e.g., r/AMD, r/investing) for the past week.
  - Public sentiment signals: notable threads/tomatoes (if available) and any consensus tone (bullish/bearish/neutral) per day.
  - News: recent AMD headlines (product launches, earnings, market commentary, supply chain updates) that could be driving sentiment.
- Step 2: Synthesize
  - Daily sentiment score (positive/negative/neutral) and volume trend.
  - Top themes per day (e.g., AI data-center demand, GPU pricing, supply chain, console/PC GPU cycles, product roadmap, competition).
  - Any notable sentiment inflectional points and their potential catalysts.
- Step 3: Implications
  - Trading implications by scenario (bull case, bear case, base case).
  - Short-term risk factors (headline risks, regulatory/competitive moves) and longer-term drivers.
- Step 4: Deliver
  - A comprehensive narrative report.
  - A final Markdown table summarizing key insights, drivers, and actionable takeaways.

Questions to tailor the next steps
- Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch for 2025-10-11 now, or would you prefer I switch to a fallback method (and if so, which sources would you like me to include)?
- Do you want me to focus more on:

  - Data center/AI demand and AMD’s ROCm/MI ecosystem,
  - Gaming/PC GPU pricing and consumer demand,
  - Console/LT products and any ecosystem updates,
  - Supply chain and semiconductor market context?

If you’re ready for me to proceed with a fallback or retry, tell me which path you prefer, and I’ll generate the AMD sentiment-and-news report accordingly, including the requested Markdown table at the end.
