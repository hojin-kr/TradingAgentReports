I’m hitting a data retrieval issue with the AMD Yahoo Finance feed right now. My get_YFin_data calls for AMD (2024-10-11 to 2025-10-11) returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t yet have the actual price history to drive a data-driven indicator analysis. I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with a solid, non-data-dependent plan you can act on while we troubleshoot the data path. Let me know which you prefer. In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen, non-redundant set of indicators and a detailed plan for AMD.

Recommended 8 indicators for AMD (diverse, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages): Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm trend context for AMD’s monthly/seasonal cycles and product-cycle effects.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages): Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming major trend direction and potential long-term breakout/retreat signals (golden/death cross with shorter averages).
- close_10_ema (Moving Averages): Responsive momentum cue; good for catching quick shifts around key price levels or around earnings/product cycle events.
- macd (MACD): Core momentum signal via EMA differences; useful for identifying momentum changes and trend initialization/weakening when combined with other filters.
- macds (MACD Signal): Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line provide clearer entry/exit timing when used with trend context from the moving averages.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Momentum strength visualization; divergence with price can precede turning points, offering early risk signals.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum fatigue/overbought-oversold lens; helps flag potential reversals, especially when price is extended versus the trend backdrop.
- atr (ATR): Volatility gauge; informs risk management (position sizing, stop placement) and helps interpret whether consolidation vs breakout phases are expanding or contracting.

Rationale for AMD context
- Trend vs. cycle: AMD often exhibits multi-quarter cycles tied to product launches, supply/demand dynamics, and AI/gaming demand. The combination of 50/200 SMA helps determine whether the stock is in a broader uptrend or downtrend, and whether pullbacks are likely to hold or fail.
- Momentum with confirmation: MACD trio (macd, macds, macdh) provides robust momentum signals and helps filter out false signals in choppy markets, which can occur around earnings announcements or major product news.
- Short-term timing and risk management: 10 EMA gives timely momentum cues for entries/exits, while RSI flags potential reversals, and ATR informs how wide to set stops given current volatility levels.
- Volatility awareness: ATR complements the other indicators by highlighting periods of elevated risk (which may affect position sizing and stop placement) and helps distinguish breakouts from false moves in a market prone to volatility around semiconductor cycles.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report on AMD’s current trend, momentum, and volatility, with cross-validation across the eight indicators.
- Clear signals for potential entries/exits (if any) and risk management guidance based on ATR-derived stop levels.
- A concise narrative of how each indicator is aligning (or diverging) from the others, plus actionable takeaways.

Markdown table: Key indicators, roles, and interpretation
| Indicator | Category | What it measures / Why it matters for AMD | How to interpret (examples) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50 SMA with rising slope suggests uptrend; price crossing below may signal risk of a pullback |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation | Price above 200 SMA indicates long-term bullish context; cross below could imply trend weakness or a top formation |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum; quick shift detection | Price crossing above 10 EMA can signal a short-term bullish move; failure or re-cross can warn of fatigue or reversals |
| macd | MACD | Momentum shift via EMA differences | MACD line crossing above zero or crossing MACD signal line can signal a trend start; divergence with price can precede reversals |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD; clearer entries/exits | MACD signal line cross with MACD for trade triggers; confirm with price trend and other indicators |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and acceleration | Expanding histogram supports continuation; shrinking or negative values warn of weakening momentum or potential reversal |
| rsi | RSI | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold context | RSI > 70 suggests potential pullback risk; RSI < 30 suggests potential rally; watch for divergences with price trend |
| atr | ATR | Market volatility; risk management basis | Rising ATR implies higher volatility and wider stops; falling ATR implies quieter markets and tighter stops |

Next steps
- I can retry fetching AMD data with get_YFin_data now to compute and present a full, data-driven 8-indicator run and a detailed trend report. If you’d like, I’ll attempt the data pull again immediately and then deliver the live analysis plus the table above in a structured narrative.
- Alternatively, if you prefer not to wait, I can proceed with the qualitative framework and provide synthetic example interpretations (clearest for decision-making while we fix the data path). Let me know which path you want.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch for AMD now and then generate the full, data-driven report?
