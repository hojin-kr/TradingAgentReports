# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD has long-run AI data-center potential via CDNA GPUs and ROCm, but near-term catalysts are unclear and Nvidia leads. Hold with disciplined risk controls and a staged upgrade only after credible multi-quarter data.

## Investment Decision
Hold. Confidence level: Moderate

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term catalysts are uncertain; Nvidia’s leadership sets a high hurdle for meaningful upside.
- AMD’s AI upside hinges on a multi-quarter data-center ramp using CDNA GPUs, ROCm, and CPU cross-sell, but durable margins and bookings proven at scale are not yet evident.
- OpenAI terms or hyperscaler commitments could improve visibility and margins, but these terms are not guaranteed.
- A staged, risk-managed exposure helps balance potential upside with downside risk, avoiding overpayment for speculative catalysts.

## Risks To Watch
- OpenAI terms and hyperscaler demand remain uncertain; upside may not materialize.
- Nvidia’s lead could constrain AMD’s share gains in the near term.
- Margin improvement and durable data-center bookings visibility are not proven yet; ROCm adoption carries execution risk.
- Macro or regulatory headwinds could slow AI hardware spending, reducing near-term clarity.
- ROCm ecosystem adoption and ASP/margins remain uncertain.
