Thanks for the nudge. The Reddit-based stock info tool failed with a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t pull the latest Reddit sentiment data for PLTR right now. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

- Option A: Retry and fetch Reddit sentiment data as soon as the tool is available again.
- Option B: Use alternative sources (news, official filings, other social channels if accessible) to build a comprehensive view, then weave in Reddit sentiment once the tool is functioning.
- Option C: Provide a rigorous, data-agnostic framework and a structured report template now, then fill in the actual sentiment numbers and daily breakdown once the data pull works.

If you’d like, I can start with Option C immediately and keep Option A or B as the next step. Below is a detailed framework and a starter analysis that you can use right away, followed by a Markdown table template to organize key points. This stays actionable even while we’re awaiting live Reddit data.

What I can deliver now (framework-focused, no live numbers yet)
1) Executive snapshot (for traders)
- What to watch this week for PLTR: AI product expansions, government/enterprise contract signals, any earnings commentary or guidance changes, regulatory or privacy-related headlines, and any material shifts in political or policy risk affecting data analytics providers.
- Potential catalysts: new contract awards, strategic partnerships, product updates (Foundry/AI integrations), cost structure changes, and macro sentiment shifts toward tech stocks with AI exposure.
- Quick risk note: Palantir’s sensitivities to contract wins/losses and AI-capitalization narratives can shift sentiment quickly; watch for any chatter around data security concerns or competitive displacement in public/private sectors.

2) Social sentiment analysis framework (how to interpret the data when you have it)
- Daily sentiment delta: trend of positive vs. negative mentions, normalized by total post volume to avoid bias from higher volume days.
- Top themes to track: AI/product accuracy, contract wins, pricing models, data privacy/regulatory risk, customer adoption/retention, leadership commentary.
- Sentiment drivers: مل тит (Examples: a big contract win could push sentiment positive; a regulatory setback or cost overruns could push sentiment negative).
- Anomaly detection: look for sudden spikes in volume or abrupt sentiment reversals that coincide with news events or product updates.

3) News flow lens (what kind of news to weigh heavily)
- Government and enterprise contracts: wins, renewals, or terminations; changes in contract scope or pricing.
- Regulatory and policy: privacy, export controls, data localization requirements, or antitrust chatter.
- Product/partnership announcements: Foundry updates, OpenAI/AI tooling integrations, or cross-industry partnerships.
- Financial signals: earnings commentary, guidance tweaks, cost management, capital allocation.
- Leadership/gear shifts: major leadership commentary or strategic pivots.

4) Trading implications by scenario
- Bull case: Positive sentiment from AI-enabled product adoption, a string of favorable contract announcements, or strong earnings guidance.
- Bear case: Negative sentiment around regulatory risk, slowing contract momentum, or margin compression due to commercialization challenges.
- Base case: Product-market fit continues with episodic volatility around contract news; risk-on/off sentiment tied to broader tech AI narratives.

5) Daily sentiment tracking plan (recommended steps)
- Collect: daily posts from Reddit and other major social channels if possible (volume and tone).
- Normalize: compute a daily sentiment score (positive minus negative divided by total posts).
- Contextualize: map sentiment to live events (news releases, earnings calls, conference presentations).
- Report: present a concise day-by-day sentiment delta with key themes and notable headlines.

6) Risk and caveats
- Data quality: sentiment signals are noisy; high-volume days can skew interpretation if not normalized.
- Event risk: government contracts are lumpy; a single contract win/loss can disproportionately affect sentiment.
- Market backdrop: broader AI hype cycles can blue-sky sentiment; separate company-specific signals from macro AI enthusiasm.

7) Suggested structure for the final report (to be filled with data)
- Section A: Summary of the past week (price action, volume, key headlines)
- Section B: Social sentiment snapshot (daily scores, top themes)
- Section C: News highlights (bullets by date with implications)
- Section D: Price/volume response to key events
- Section E: Scenario-based trading implications (bull/bear/base)
- Section F: Risks and watchlist
- Section G: Quick reference table (key points, sources, confidence)

8) Makrdown table (end-of-report table template)
- I’ll include a filled table once data is in, but here is a ready-to-fill template you can paste into your notes:

| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | Daily Sentiment Score | Top Themes (2–3) | Key News/Events | Price Move (intraday/close) | Notes / Confidence |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|---:|
| 2025-10-06 | 0.12 | AI adoption, contract talk | New contract win rumored | -2.4% / +0.5% | Moderate confidence; verify source |
| 2025-10-07 | -0.05 | Regulation risk, data privacy | Regulatory inquiry update | -1.8% | Monitor official statements |
| 2025-10-08 | 0.22 | Foundry integration, enterprise uptake | Major partnership announced | +3.1% | High confidence on news-driven move |
| 2025-10-09 | -0.15 | Costs, margin pressure | Earnings guide adjusted downward | -4.0% | Watch next-quarter guidance |

Next steps — please choose one:
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll report back with the latest daily sentiment and themes as soon as the tool returns data).
- Option B: I proceed with Option C (this framework plus an expanded, thorough qualitative analysis now, then I’ll slot in Reddit data as soon as the tool works).
- Option C: You provide any alternate data you have (links, pasted posts, or summaries) and I’ll synthesize them into the report with the same level of depth.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option C right away, I can start drafting a more detailed, narrative PLTR analysis for the past week that stays strictly qualitative until we fetch live Reddit sentiment data.
