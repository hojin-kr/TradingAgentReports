Sorry—I'm running into a tool error pulling Reddit sentiment for TSLA right now. The get_reddit_stock_info call is returning a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch the latest Reddit posts for 2025-10-11 at the moment. I can either retry soon or switch to a non-Reddit sentiment approach if you’d like me to proceed now.

Here are two options. Let me know which you prefer:

Option A: Retry and continue with Reddit-based sentiment
- I’ll automatically retry pulling Reddit data for TSLA as soon as the tool is available and then generate a comprehensive long report (social sentiment by day over the past week, key themes, and implications for traders, plus the latest company news).
- The report will include a detailed day-by-day sentiment breakdown (bullish/neutral/bearish), top topics (e.g., deliveries, margins, price actions, FSD/robotaxi, competition), and how those align with any news events.

Option B: Proceed with a non-Reddit sentiment and news-focused analysis
- I’ll compile a thorough review based on company news and general market sentiment from other sources (without Reddit data). This will cover:
  - The week’s Tesla news flow (production/delivery numbers, price actions, product updates, regulatory/news catalysts).
  - Broad sentiment signals we can discuss meaningfully without Reddit data (e.g., analyst tone, major headlines, social chatter from other platforms if available).
  - Trader-oriented implications, risk factors, and potential catalysts for the next 1–4 weeks.
- Note: Without Reddit data, the sentiment granularity by day will be less precise, but I’ll still deliver a structured, decision-ready analysis.

If you’d like me to proceed now with Option B (no Reddit data), I can start drafting the long-form report outline right away and fill in sections as data becomes available. If you prefer Option A, I’ll retry and then deliver the full Reddit-informed analysis once the tool succeeds.

In the meantime, here is the structure I’ll use for the final long report (will be filled with data once available). I’ll append a Markdown table at the end with the key takeaways.

Proposed structure for the long TSLA report
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment direction, notable themes, and immediate catalysts.
- Daily sentiment analysis (last 7 days): bullish/neutral/bearish breakdown, volume spikes, and notable post themes.
- Top themes by day: production/delivery updates, pricing/policy changes, FSD/robotaxi discussions, cyber/competitors, regulatory/regulatory risk, supply chain signals.
- Newsflow recap (past week): key Tesla news headlines, earnings commentary, management quotes, partnerships, product launches, regulatory actions.
- Market context: sector sentiment, macro drivers affecting TSLA (rates, EV adoption news, competition).
- Implications for traders:
  - Short-term trading ideas (days to weeks) based on sentiment hotspots.
  - Risk factors and scenario analysis (bull case, base case, bear case).
  - Key data points to watch next week (delivery numbers, margins, caps, press releases).
- Conclusion: synthesis of sentiment vs. fundamentals and a forward-looking stance.
- Appendix: methodology notes and data sources.

If you’d like me to proceed now with Option B, just say “Proceed with Option B.” If you want me to retry the Reddit data first (Option A), I’ll attempt again and deliver the full Reddit-based report as soon as I can access the data.
