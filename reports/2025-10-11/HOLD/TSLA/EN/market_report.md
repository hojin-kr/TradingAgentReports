I attempted to fetch TSLA data for 2020-01-01 to 2025-10-11 but hit a data access error (FileNotFoundError from get_YFin_data). It looks like a temporary issue with the data source. I can retry now, or proceed with a best-effort framework using the indicators I’d select (and you can run the fetch in the background). Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here are the 8 selected indicators and why they’re suitable for TSLA given a broad, volatile tech/EV stock context:

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale for these choices
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average): Captures the medium-term trend direction. Useful for confirming whether TSLA is in a sustained uptrend or downtrend and acts as a dynamic support/resistance level.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average): Long-term trend benchmark. Helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death cross potential) and provides a backbone for strategic, longer-horizon decisions.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average): A responsive short-term momentum gauge. Helps flag quick shifts in price action and potential entry points when used with the longer-term averages.
- macd (MACD line): Momentum-based signal, useful for spotting trend changes via crossovers and divergences. In TSLA’s volatile environment, MACD can help confirm trend strength.
- macds (MACD Signal): Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with the MACD line provide more reliable trigger signals when combined with other filters.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum oscillator to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. In trending markets, RSI can stay elevated or depressed for extended periods, so it’s best when used with trend context (50/200 SMA, VWMA, etc.).
- atr (Average True Range): Volatility measure to set more informed stops and position sizing. In TSLA, which experiences rapid price swings, ATR helps manage risk and adapt to changing volatility.
- vwma (VWMA): Volume-weighted trend confirmation. Combines price action with volume to confirm the strength of moves, reducing false signals during spurts of abnormal volume.

How signals might play out on TSLA (framework, not yet data-driven)
- Trend confirmation setup:
  - Price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with 50 SMA above 200 SMA.
  - 10 EMA aligned with the longer trend (e.g., 10 EMA above 50 SMA in an uptrend).
  - VWMA rising and price trading above VWMA to confirm volume-supported momentum.
- Momentum confirmation:
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal line, ideally with MACD histogram turning positive and expanding.
  - RSI moving from mid-range toward the 50s or higher, but not excessively overbought (avoid readings >70 in a volatile uptrend unless supported by price action and VWMA strength).
- Risk management:
  - ATR increasing would suggest wider stops or larger risk gates; use ATR to set stop distances that accommodate current volatility.
  - If ATR compresses, be mindful of potential range-bound behavior and watch for breakdowns from key support around the 50 SMA or VWMA.
- Entry/exit ideas (qualitative, to be refined once data is available):
  - Enter long when: price breaks above a confluence of 50 SMA and 200 SMA with 10 EMA leading the move, MACD bullish crossover confirmed, RSI around 50-60, and VWMA trending up.
  - Exit or reduce risk when: price fails to hold above 50/200 SMA, MACD loses bullish momentum, RSI fails to sustain above 50, or ATR rises sharply indicating increased downside risk (tighten stops accordingly).
  - For shorts (if you’re considering hedges or a counter-trend strategy): look for price rejection at resistance near the 50 SMA or 200 SMA with MACD turning bearish and RSI rolling toward 30-40, supported by a downsloping VWMA.

Execution plan and options
- Option A: I retry fetching TSLA data now and, once successful, I generate the indicator readings and a detailed trend report with a data-backed narrative and a final actionable set of signals.
- Option B: You proceed with the qualitative framework above now and I’ll fill in the precise numbers and trend nuances as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry now, I’ll kick off a fresh data pull for TSLA and then deliver a complete, data-backed trends report with a succinct, trader-ready set of signals.
