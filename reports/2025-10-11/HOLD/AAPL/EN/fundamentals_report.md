I ran into a tooling issue trying to fetch AAPL fundamentals and insider data. The parallel and individual tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError, so I couldn’t retrieve insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, or income statement data at this moment.

What I can do now
- Retry data retrieval immediately if you’d like.
- Retry after a short interval (to see if the environment stabilizes).
- Proceed with a qualitative, non-numeric analysis based on general fundamentals (without the latest data) while we wait for data to come through.
- Use any alternative sources you approve (if you want me to rely on other datasets you provide).

Provisional plan for the comprehensive report (once data is available)
- Company profile: overview, business segments, major products, and revenue drivers for Apple (AAPL).
- Recent fundamentals (quarterly): income statement highlights, balance sheet, and cash flow snapshot from the most recent quarter (and year-over-year context).
- Financial history: trend analysis over the past several quarters/years (revenue growth, margins, FCF, debt levels, share count changes).
- Insider sentiment: interpretation of public insider opinions and how it may influence near-term price action.
- Insider transactions: recent buys/sells by insiders and what signals they might send.
- Trading implications: granular, data-driven takeaways for traders (e.g., quality of earnings, cash flow resilience, balance sheet strength, insider activity signals).
- Risks: macro, product cycle, supply chain, regulatory, and competitive risks.
- Key points table: a concise Markdown table summarizing findings, sources, dates, and trading implications.

Proposed Markdown table (structure to fill once data is available)
- Area | Key Finding | Source | Date | Trader Implication | Notes/Risk
- Company Profile | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Income Statement (Most Recent) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Balance Sheet (Most Recent) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Cash Flow (Most Recent) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Insider Sentiment (Past 15 Days) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Insider Transactions (Past 15 Days) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Financial History (Last 8 Quarters) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...
- Risks | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...

Would you like me to:
- Retry fetching the data now, or
- Wait a moment and retry, or
- Proceed with a qualitative framework now and fill in the data as soon as the tools respond?

If you want me to retry now, I’ll kick off the data pull again and report back with the full comprehensive analysis as soon as the results are available.
