I ran into a data retrieval issue fetching AAPL data for the requested range (FileNotFoundError). This looks like an environment/service problem on my end rather than a problem with AAPL itself. I can retry the data fetch, or if you can provide the CSV data yourself, I can proceed immediately with the indicators. Alternatively, I can outline the indicator plan now and apply it as soon as the data access is working again.

Recommended 8 indicators for AAPL (complementary, non-redundant coverage)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average to gauge medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average to confirm long-term trend and potential golden/death cross contexts.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average for quick momentum shifts and potential early entry signals.
- macd: MACD line to capture momentum changes and crossovers.
- macds: MACD signal line to confirm MACD crossovers and reduce false signals.
- rsi: RSI for momentum strength and overbought/oversold signals, with divergence context.
- atr: ATR to gauge volatility and inform risk management (e.g., stop placement, position sizing adjustments).
- vwma: Volume-Weighted Moving Average to confirm price action with volume, helping validate trends during spikes or dull volume periods.

Why this set is suitable
- Trend confirmation and timing: 50/200 SMAs give both mid- and long-term trend context; 10 EMA adds a fast read on momentum, helping triangulate entries when combined with longer-term trend signals.
- Momentum confirmation: MACD and its signal line provide momentum change signals; RSI adds a viewpoint on strength and potential reversals, especially when price action reaches extreme levels.
- Volatility and risk: ATR informs you about current volatility levels for setting stops and sizing positions; VWMA helps ensure that price moves are supported by volume, reducing the risk of false breakouts in thinly traded moments.

How I’ll interpret signals once the data is available
- Trend perspective:
  - Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA with 50/200 alignment favorable (e.g., price above both, 50 SMA above 200 SMA).
  - Price crossing above/below the 10 EMA can indicate near-term momentum shifts; confirm with the longer-term trend (SMA cross or VWMA confirmation).
- Momentum perspective:
  - MACD crossing above the MACD signal and rising implies bullish momentum; cross below implies bearish momentum.
  - RSI rising into the 60–70 range supports upside momentum; overbought zones (>70) require caution and usually need trend context confirmation.
- Volatility and risk management:
  - Higher ATR signals wider stop ranges; lower ATR allows tighter stops if price action is consolidating.
  - VWMA alignment with price action strengthens the credibility of breakouts or sustained moves.
- Trade context rules (conceptual, not financial advice):
  - Long setup: price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA with MACD bullish crossover, RSI trending upward and not showing overbought extremes, ATR indicating manageable volatility, and price validating move with VWMA above price or vice versa (volume-supported breakout).
  - Short setup: price below 50 SMA and trending toward/under 200 SMA with MACD bearish crossover, RSI rolling over from elevated levels, ATR indicating sufficient volatility for a move, and VWMA confirming the move with price action.

Next steps
- I can retry to fetch the data now or on your cue. If you’d like me to retry automatically, tell me to proceed. Alternatively, you can provide the data (CSV) and I’ll generate the full indicator report immediately.
- If you want, I can proceed with a provisional qualitative analysis using generic market patterns for AAPL in this period, but I won’t be able to quote precise indicator values until data is available.

Markdown table: Key points to remember
| Indicator | Purpose | What to look for | Quick decision cue |
|-----------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Price relative to 50 SMA; slope of 50 SMA | Bullish if price above and 50 SMA sloping up |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Price relative to 200 SMA; golden/death cross context | Bullish if price above 200 SMA and 50/200 alignment |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price vs. 10 EMA; cross events | Bullish if price crosses above 10 EMA |
| macd | Momentum | MACD line vs. signal; zero line crossing | Buy when MACD crosses above signal; sell when below |
| macds | Confirmation | MACD signal crossovers | Use with MACD for higher conviction |
| rsi | Momentum strength | RSI level and divergences | Overbought/oversold alerts; divergence signals |
| atr | Volatility/risk | ATR value relative to recent range | Higher ATR implies wider stops; lower ATR tighter stops |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed trend | Price movement with VWMA alignment | Confirm breakouts with VWMA support |

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now or adjust the date range (e.g., a shorter window like 2025-01-01 to 2025-10-11), tell me and I’ll proceed.
