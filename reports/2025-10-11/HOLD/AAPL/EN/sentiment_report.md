Sorry about that — the Reddit stock info retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t fetch the Reddit sentiment data for AAPL right now. Here are options and a plan for moving forward:

What you can choose
- Option A: I retry the Reddit sentiment fetch now (or on the next turn) and then generate the full long-form report with day-by-day sentiment and news analysis.
- Option B: I proceed with a robust qualitative framework for the report using only general context and publicly known factors (without the Reddit data) and clearly mark placeholders where Reddit sentiment would be included.
- Option C: You provide an alternative data source or a file you’ve got access to, and I’ll integrate it.

What I can deliver right now (framework you can review)
If you want without waiting for the tool, here’s a full framework and a placeholder structure for the long report on AAPL (current date context: 2025-10-11). This will be ready to populate with day-by-day sentiment and news as soon as the data fetch works.

1) Executive snapshot
- Ticker: AAPL
- Timeframe: Past 7 days
- Core takeaway: A concise read on whether social sentiment and news have been supportive or cautious for near-term price action, with emphasis on potential catalyst risk and opportunities.

2) Data sources and methodology
- Social sentiment: Reddit, X/Twitter, Facebook, threads, forums (prioritize Reddit for institutional signal)
- News: Company announcements, product launches, earnings, regulatory/regulatory actions, macro news
- Sentiment metrics: daily sentiment score, volume, notable topics, topic drift, volatility proxy
- Limitations: Data gaps (current tool error), potential biases, and how we adjust for noise

3) Daily sentiment and themes (past 7 days)
- For each day: date, sentiment score, sentiment direction (positive/neutral/negative), volume (relative), top themes (e.g., iPhone cycle, AI integration, supply chain, services growth, regulatory concerns)
- Note: I’ll populate this with exact figures once the data tool is functioning

4) News heatmap and key catalysts
- Daily or near-daily news bullets
- Category tags: product/innovation, financials, regulatory, supply chain, market/competition, geopolitical
- Quick read: whether the day’s news was supportive, neutral, or negative for sentiment and risk

5) Thematic sentiment analysis
- Major themes driving sentiment over the week:
  - Product cycles (e.g., new devices, refresh rumors, services integration)
  - AI and software ecosystem enhancements
  - Services revenue trajectory and user engagement
  - China and international markets exposure
  - Regulatory and antitrust considerations
- For each theme: trend direction, impact magnitude, potential price/action implications

6) Market context and cross-asset backdrop
- Key macro factors affecting Apple (rates expectations, consumer demand signals, tech sector momentum)
- Competition landscape and supplier dynamics
- Capital allocation signals (buybacks, dividends) if relevant in the week

7) Trading implications and risk signals
- Near-term trade ideas (long/short/neutral with risk controls) based on sentiment momentum and news catalysts
- Key risk factors to monitor (e.g., a major product event, supply chain disruption, regulatory shifts)
- Scenarios and trigger levels for action

8) Summary and actionable takeaways
- A concise verdict on sentiment health and likely near-term price action
- Clear watchlist items for traders

9) Appendices
- Data notes, any caveats, and a plan for updating the report as new data arrives

Proposed Makrdown table (to be populated once data is available)
- This table will be appended at the end of the final report and will include day-by-day sentiment and news signals.

Next steps
- Please tell me which option you prefer (A, B, or C).
- If you want me to proceed with Option A right now, I’ll reattempt the Reddit data fetch in the next turn and then generate the full long report with a detailed day-by-day sentiment and news synthesis for AAPL.
- If you choose Option B or C, I’ll start building out the complete report framework and fill in data as soon as it’s available.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data retrieval now, or do you want me to proceed with the framework (Option B) while we wait for the tool to become available again?
