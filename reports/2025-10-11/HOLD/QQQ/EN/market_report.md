Thanks for the request. I attempted to fetch the QQQ data and compute the indicators, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source or path used by the tool is currently unavailable. I can retry if the environment is fixed, or we can switch to a fallback plan once data access is restored. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan of how I would proceed and the 8 indicators I would select to provide complementary, non-redundant insights for QQQ.

What I would do once data is available
- Retrieve historical price data for QQQ covering the requested window (and a look-back period for indicators as needed).
- Compute up to 8 diverse indicators that cover trend, momentum, volatility, and volume/confirmation to avoid redundancy.
- Produce a nuanced, granular trend analysis with context about crossovers, divergences, regime shifts, and risk considerations.
- Present a concise, trader-friendly table of key signals and a clean summary table at the end.

Recommended 8 indicators (diverse, complementary)
1) close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
- Why: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm trend while filtering noise.
- Trade value: Crosses of price or other indicators with 50SMA can indicate trend pullbacks or early entries.

2) close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
- Why: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify the broader market regime (bullish/bearish/flat) and detect golden/death cross dynamics.
- Trade value: Use for higher-timeframe trend confirmation and position-sizing in alignment with the macro regime.

3) close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
- Why: Responsive short-term momentum signal; captures quick shifts and potential entry points.
- Trade value: Can be used in conjunction with longer SMAs to filter false signals in volatile periods.

4) macd (MACD)
- Why: Momentum framework based on EMAs; provides crossovers and divergence cues.
- Trade value: Primary trigger signal when MACD line crosses above/below zero or its signal line; good for trend-following entries/exits.

5) macds (MACD Signal)
- Why: Smoothing of MACD line; helps filter MACD crossovers.
- Trade value: Cross with MACD line is a more robust entry/exit signal when confirmed with other indicators.

6) macdh (MACD Histogram)
- Why: Momentum strength visualization; divergence can precede changes in price.
- Trade value: Increasing histogram supports up-moves; shrinking/negative histogram signals momentum loss.

7) rsi (RSI)
- Why: Momentum oscillator that highlights overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals.
- Trade value: Watch for 70/30 thresholds and divergences; use with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.

8) atr (Average True Range)
- Why: Volatility gauge; informs risk management, stop placement, and position sizing.
- Trade value: Use ATR to set dynamic stops and adapt position sizes to current volatility regime.

Notes on suitability for QQQ context
- QQQ is heavily tied to tech growth and NASDAQ-100 dynamics. In strong tech rallies, you may see persistent uptrends that push RSI into higher zones for extended periods; in regime shifts, MACD and histogram changes can precede price moves.
- The combination above provides:
  - Trend confirmation (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA)
  - Momentum signals (MACD family, RSI)
  - Volatility and risk management (ATR)
- This set avoids overlap (e.g., not mixing stochastic indicators with RSI) and ensures each indicator adds distinct information.

Next steps and options
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval as soon as the data source is accessible.
- Alternatively, I can proceed with a best-effort, qualitative scenario analysis based on typical QQQ behavior and explain how the 8 indicators would be interpreted in common regimes (bullish breakout, pullback, consolidation, etc.). This would not be data-driven but could still provide actionable frameworks.
- If you prefer, specify a different date range, ticker (e.g., response could cover SPY or QQQQ-specific proxies), or a shorter look-back so we can produce a quick, data-backed score once the data layer is operational.

Indicative table of indicators and what they deliver (structure you’ll see in the full report)
| Indicator       | Category          | What it measures / signals | How it helps for QQQ trading |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| close_50_sma    | Moving Averages   | 50-day trend, dynamic support/resistance | Confirms mid-term trend; helps filter entries in pullbacks |
| close_200_sma   | Moving Averages   | 200-day trend, long-term regime | Helps distinguish broad bullish/bearish markets; supports strategic positioning |
| close_10_ema    | Moving Averages   | Short-term momentum, quick shifts | Signals timely entries/exits; works with longer averages to filter noise |
| macd            | MACD Related      | Momentum crossovers, trend changes | Primary trend-following trigger; robust when combined with other signals |
| macds           | MACD Signal       | EMA-smoothed MACD, crossovers | Reduces false signals; confirms MACD-based entries/exits |
| macdh           | MACD Histogram    | Momentum strength and divergence | Early warning of momentum shifts; adds nuance to MACD reads |
| rsi             | Momentum          | Overbought/oversold, momentum divergence | Signals potential reversals; must be contextualized with trend |
| atr             | Volatility        | Market volatility and range | Uses for risk control, stop placement, and position sizing adjustments |

If you want me to proceed with any of the above options (retrying data fetch, doing a qualitative scenario analysis, or using an alternative ticker/date range), tell me which path you prefer and I’ll move forward.
