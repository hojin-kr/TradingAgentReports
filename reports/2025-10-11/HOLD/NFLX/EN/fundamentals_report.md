I hit a data-fetching error trying to pull NFLX fundamentals right now. The parallel tool calls returned FileNotFoundError (internal data access issue), so I don’t have the insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin balance sheet/cash flow/income statement data to compile the full report yet.

What I can do next
- Try again now: I can re-submit the data requests (individually or in parallel) to see if the issue is transient.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a detailed framework and fill in the data as soon as the tools respond. In that case, you’ll get a comprehensive report with the exact figures once the fetch succeeds.
- Alternatively, you can paste any of the data you already have (e.g., recent income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, or insider notes), and I’ll build the report around it.

Proposed plan for the report (once data is available)
- Company profile: Netflix, Inc. overview, business model, segments, competitive position, and growth strategy (content, international expansion, ad-supported tier, gaming if relevant).
- Latest financial snapshot (quarterly and trailing twelve months): revenues, gross profit, operating income, net income, EPS, margins, capex, free cash flow.
- Balance sheet highlights: cash, debt, total assets, equity, liquidity ratios.
- Cash flow overview: operating cash flow, investing cash flow (content spend), financing cash flow, net change in cash.
- Financial history and trend analysis: quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year changes, margin progression, leverage, and cash flow dynamics.
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days): tone, notable buys/sells, potential signals.
- Key risk factors and catalysts: content spend vs. monetization, subscriber dynamics, competition, macro effects, regulatory considerations.
- Tradeable insights for traders: identify how the fundamentals could inform upside/downside scenarios, and potential catalysts or warning signs.
- Summary table: a concise Markdown table at the end that distills the most relevant points for quick reference.

If you’d like me to retry immediately, please confirm and I’ll re-run the data fetches (I’ll report back with the results as soon as they come in). If you prefer, you can also provide any data you already have, and I’ll build the report around it right away.
