Sorry about that—the Reddit stock data tool is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a temporary environment issue on the tool side. I can try again in a moment, or we can switch to an alternative plan.

Here are your options moving forward:
- Option 1: Retry now. I’ll attempt another fetch for NFLX Reddit data for 2025-10-11 and then build the full long-form report with sentiment, news, and implications.
- Option 2: Proceed with a structured outline and methodology now, then fill in the data as soon as the Reddit feed becomes available (or you authorize an alternative data source if you have one).
- Option 3: If you want immediate progress without Reddit data, I can generate a detailed, data-agnostic framework for NFLX sentiment and news analysis and clearly mark sections that require Reddit data to complete.

If you’d like me to retry, I’ll run the Reddit data fetch again for NFLX on 2025-10-11 and proceed with a comprehensive weekly sentiment/mentions analysis and implications for traders. Just say the word.
