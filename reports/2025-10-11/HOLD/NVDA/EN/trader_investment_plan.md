Recommendation: Buy (NVDA)

Rationale
- Aligns with the proposed plan: NVDA sits at the center of durable AI infrastructure growth, with a strong software moat (CUDA ecosystem), likely multi-year demand visibility, and solid balance sheet to fund R&D and capital returns.
- Upside drivers remain intact: expanding AI compute needs from training to inference, services, and edge deployments; hyperscaler and enterprise adoption; ongoing opportunities from buybacks and strategic actions.
- Risks are real but manageable with disciplined entry and risk controls: valuation considerations, potential near-term demand normalization, regulatory and macro headwinds, and execution risk.

Actionable approach
- Use a staged entry (2–3 tranches) to balance risk and capture upside:
  - Tranche 1: initiate core exposure on a pullback or consolidation zone.
  - Tranche 2: add on durability signals or a breakout with strong volume.
  - Tranche 3: complete core exposure on a controlled pullback after positive catalysts or broad market strength.
- Hedging and risk controls:
  - Hedge a meaningful portion of the position with long-dated puts (6–12 months) or implement a collar to cap downside while preserving upside.
  - Set stop levels ~12–15% below each tranche’s entry, adjusting for volatility.
  - Limit single-name concentration (consider a portfolio cap, e.g., 2–5% of equity sleeve) and diversify with other AI/infrastructure names.
- Monitoring and catalysts:
  - Track hyperscaler capex updates, CUDA roadmap milestones, regional demand signals, and any regulatory developments (export controls, policy shifts).
  - Reassess on quarterly updates for CUDA revenue mix, margin trajectory, and cash-flow dynamics; be prepared to trim or hedge if a material miss or deceleration appears.

Bottom line
- The core conviction is that NVDA offers multi-year AI infrastructure upside with an embedded software moat and solid financial flexibility. Execute via a disciplined, staged entry with protective hedges and clear risk controls to manage near-term volatility.
