I attempted to fetch SPY data with the provided tools, but all five calls returned a FileNotFoundError. That suggests the current tool environment may not have SPY data available (or there’s a configuration issue). There are a couple of important considerations here:

- SPY is an ETF (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust), not a single company. Insider sentiment and insider transactions data are generally applicable to individual companies, not to ETFs. So some of the requested data points (insider sentiment/transactions) may simply not exist for SPY in the way they do for a company.
- The SimFin/insider tools are geared toward company-level financials and insider activity. For SPY, the most relevant “fundamental” data would be ETF-level metrics (fund profile, expense ratio, AUM, liquidity) and, if desired, holdings/sector exposures (which come from the fund’s underlying index and official fund disclosures, not company financials).

What I can do next (two clear paths):

Option 1 — Switch to a real company ticker for a full fundamental report
- I can fetch balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, and insider sentiment/transactions for a specific company (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, AMZN) and produce a comprehensive, trader-focused fundamental report with a detailed Markdown table at the end.

Option 2 — Provide a high-level SPY ETF profile (no insider data)
- I can deliver a SPY-focused fundamental profile based on ETF characteristics (purpose, structure, expense ratio, AUM, liquidity, issuer, replication method) and discuss the implications for traders.
- If you want holdings/sector exposures, we can note that those are governed by the S&P 500 composition and SPY disclosures; I can outline how to interpret those and what to look for, but I won’t have precise current numbers without a data source.

Please tell me which path you prefer:
- Continue with a specific company ticker (name or ticker) for a full fundamental report, or
- Proceed with a SPY ETF profile and a qualitative, trader-focused overview (with recommendations on where to pull the latest holdings/weights if you want exact numbers).

If you’re aiming for a quick start, I can propose a sample report structure for SPY ETF (Option 2) and fill in qualitative insights right away, then we can fetch exact holdings data in a follow-up step.
