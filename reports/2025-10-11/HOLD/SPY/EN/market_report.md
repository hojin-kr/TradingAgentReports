I tried to pull SPY data with get_YFin_data, but I’m hitting a backend error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). This looks like a data-access issue on the current environment rather than a problem with SPY itself. I can retry fetching data now if you’d like, or proceed with a plan for SPY analysis once data access is restored.

In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan using a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for SPY (the S&P 500 ETF). If you approve, I’ll run these indicators as soon as the data retrieval works.

Recommended 8 indicators for SPY (diverse, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average)
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps identify intermediate-term trend context.
  - Use: Look for price crossing above/below the 50 SMA as a trend filter; use with faster signals for entry/exit timing.
- close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average)
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark and macro regime context; detects major trend shifts (golden/death crosses).
  - Use: Use for strategic framing (bullish/bearish regime) and to confirm signals from shorter-term indicators.
- close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average)
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Responsive short-term momentum; captures quick shifts in price action.
  - Use: Combine with longer-term averages to filter false signals; good for spotting early entry points in a trending move.
- macd (MACD)
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: Momentum and potential trend-change signals via the MACD line crossovers and divergences.
  - Use: Use MACD line crossing the signal as a basic trigger, but confirm with price action and other filters in low-volatility or range-bound periods.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Purpose: Momentum strength and divergence signals; visualizes the gap between MACD and its signal.
  - Use: Monitor histogram expansion/contraction for momentum shifts; pair with MACD line signals to filter false positives.
- rsi (RSI)
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Purpose: Measures overbought/oversold conditions and momentum strength; helps identify potential reversals or continuations.
  - Use: Look for overbought/oversold extremes (e.g., 70/30) in conjunction with trend context; watch for divergence in strong trends.
- atr (ATR)
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Purpose: Quantifies current volatility to inform position sizing and stop placement.
  - Use: Set dynamic stops/targets; increase risk buffers in higher volatility regimes and narrow them in calmer periods.
- vwma (VWMA)
  - Category: Volume-Based Indicators
  - Purpose: Trend confirmation when price action aligns with volume-weighted movement.
  - Use: Confirm price moves with volume; signals that high-volume moves are more likely to be sustained.

Rationale for this selection
- Diversified insights: Combines trend (50/200 SMA), short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD, MACD Histogram), momentum strength (RSI), volatility/risk management (ATR), and volume-backed trend confirmation (VWMA).
- Non-redundant: While MACD and MACD Histogram are related, they offer complementary views on momentum magnitude and momentum change, reducing redundancy when interpreted with price action. The set avoids duplicating indicators that would largely convey the same signal (e.g., using both stochastic RSI and RSI would be redundant here).
- Practical for SPY context: SPY tracks a broad market index; using a mix of longer-term trend anchors (50/200 SMA), a responsive short-term signal (10 EMA), momentum confirmation (MACD + Histogram + RSI), volatility (ATR), and volume context (VWMA) provides a robust framework across different market regimes.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, data-driven trend and signal report for SPY using the 8 indicators above.
- Fine-grained interpretation: how the ensemble suggests entry/exit timing, risk management considerations, and regime transitions (e.g., transitioning from range-bound to trending, or vice versa).
- A concise run-down of current conditions (as of the latest data) and a set of actionable notes for short-term and medium-term trades.

Next steps
- Option 1: I retry pulling SPY data now and then compute the indicators exactly as outlined.
- Option 2: If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative framework and keep monitoring for when the data becomes accessible, delivering the full data-driven report as soon as possible.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry now, I’ll attempt again immediately and then proceed with the indicator calculations and the full report.
