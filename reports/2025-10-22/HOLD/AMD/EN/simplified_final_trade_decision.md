# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD makes CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators for data centers and AI. The stock could rise on AI demand, but near-term headwinds and supply risks justify a HOLD until two straight quarters show durable momentum.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- AI and data-center demand could boost AMD’s data-center business over time.
- The integrated CPU+GPU+accelerator stack raises switching costs and cross-sell potential; software ecosystem enhances efficiency.
- Potential margin gains as data-center mix and high-margin accelerators contribute to gross margins.
- Strong cash flow supports ongoing R&D and enterprise expansion.
- Upgrade to Buy would require two consecutive quarters of clear, durable momentum; current signals are not yet there.

## Risks To Watch
- Near-term headwinds from consumer GPU volatility and macro-related cutbacks in hyperscale spending.
- Execution risk across a multi-architecture mix versus Nvidia’s software moat.
- Supply/timing risk tied to reliance on TSMC and possible node/packaging delays.
- Valuation risk if growth slows or momentum proves not durable.
- Pipeline risk in cross-sell software adoption and ecosystem strength.
