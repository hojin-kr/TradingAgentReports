I tried to pull AMD data with the get_YFin_data tool, but it returned an internal file error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry fetching the data, or if you have the CSV handy, you can provide it here and I’ll proceed immediately with the indicator analysis. In the meantime, here’s a concrete, non-data-dependent plan you can use once the data is available.

Proposed indicators (8 total) and why they’re suitable for AMD
1) close_50_sma
- What it tells you: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- Why it matters for AMD: AMD’s price often follows broader equity cycles and tech demand trends. The 50 SMA helps confirm the current trend and can act as a flexible anchor during moderate pullbacks.

2) close_200_sma
- What it tells you: Long-term trend direction and major support/resistance levels.
- Why it matters for AMD: In semis, long-term trend shifts (e.g., from a strong uptrend to a pullback) can significantly impact position sizing and risk. The 200 SMA helps validate strategic bias (bullish vs bearish).

3) close_10_ema
- What it tells you: Short-term momentum and quicker trend shifts.
- Why it matters for AMD: In a high-volatility tech name, the 10 EMA provides earlier signals than the longer SMA, useful for timely entries/exits when micro-trends develop around earnings, AI cycle news, or supply/demand shifts.

4) macd
- What it tells you: Momentum crossovers and the strength of the trend.
- Why it matters for AMD: MACD crossovers and divergence can flag potential trend changes or continuation, especially around major catalysts like AI market demand or competition moves.

5) macds
- What it tells you: MACD signal line, used to confirm MACD-driven signals.
- Why it matters for AMD: Using MACD with its signal line helps filter false signals and improves timing when combined with other indicators.

6) rsi
- What it tells you: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions.
- Why it matters for AMD: RSI can help gauge when the stock is stretched in either direction. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; use trend context to interpret reversals and potential pullbacks.

7) boll
- What it tells you: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a baseline for price movement and volatility context.
- Why it matters for AMD: The middle line acts as a dynamic center; price interactions with the middle can indicate consolidation or a setup for a breakout/mean-reversion when used with bands (upper/lower bands for confirmation).

8) atr
- What it tells you: Realistic volatility level and volatility-based risk management cues.
- Why it matters for AMD: ATR helps you size positions and place stops with respect to actual price movement, which is crucial in a stock with volatile moves around earnings or AI-cycle news.

Notes on how to use these indicators together
- Trend confirmation: Look for alignment between close_50_sma and close_200_sma (e.g., price staying above both, or a golden cross/death cross).
- Entry timing: Use close_10_ema and macd/macs signals together. For example, a bullish MACD crossover with price above the 50 SMA and a rising 10 EMA strengthens a potential entry.
- Momentum vs volatility: RSI helps you avoid buying into extreme overbought levels if the broader trend shows signs of reversal. ATR contextualizes stop placement once you have a position.
- Volatility breakouts: Boll middle with price testing/holding above the middle line can indicate consolidation before a breakout; use ATR to adjust stops and position sizing during these phases.
- Risk controls: Combine ATR with your stop levels to avoid stops being set too tight in volatile periods; VWMA could be added later if you want a volume-confirmed price path (not in this 8-indicator set to avoid redundancy).

Next steps
- If you want me to proceed with a detailed, data-driven Trends and Signals report for AMD, I can retry pulling the AMD data now. Please confirm you want me to retry the data fetch.
- Alternatively, if you have the CSV (or a date range you prefer), you can share it and I’ll generate the full indicators analysis and the final report immediately.
- If you’d like, I can tailor the 8-indicator set further to a specific trading style (e.g., aggressive swing, longer-term position, or intraday scalping) once data is available.

Proposed output format (what I’ll deliver once data is loaded)
- A nuanced narrative covering trend, momentum, volatility, and risk context for AMD.
- Interpretation of each indicator in the context of AMD’s recent price action and known catalysts.
- A synchronized 8-indicator digest showing current signals and practical trading implications.
- A Markdown table at the end organizing the key points for quick reference.
