# Daily Trading Intelligence: AMD

## Executive Snapshot
- Macro backdrop remains a risk-on/risk-off tug as inflation data and central-bank rhetoric shape rate expectations; a softer USD and resilient capex backdrop would support semis, especially data-center demand.  
- AMD’s trajectory hinges on hyperscale AI compute demand and product mix (Instinct/MI accelerators, EPYC), with consumer GPU cyclicality a near-term risk.  
- Price action to watch: **support around $95**; **resistance around $110–112**; breakout targets **$125** and beyond.  
- Base case: constructive if data-center capex holds; risk-managed long with stops below **$95** and initial targets toward **$110–$115**; bullish above **$125** toward **$135–$140**.

## Macro Backdrop
- Inflation trajectory and central-bank guidance: cooler inflation supports rate cuts/pivot expectations, aiding risk assets; sticky inflation can keep yields elevated and pressure tech.
- USD and capex mood: softer dollar benefits multinationals; hyperscaler capex cycles drive AMD data-center demand and ASP/margin dynamics.
- AI/compute demand cycle: ongoing need for AI memory/compute across hyperscalers; demand normalization versus peak build-out influences gross margins.
- Supply chain and foundry risk: TSMC capacity and logistics resilience impact AMD’s ability to meet demand and defend pricing power.

## Company-Specific Catalysts
- Data-center AI capex commentary from hyperscalers; new AI deployment announcements can lift AMD's data-center prospects.
- Roadmap updates for Instinct/MI accelerators, CPU/APU launches, and any foundry collaboration news.
- Foundry supply news (TSMC capacity, capex timing) and potential changes to wafer allocation or pricing power.
- Geopolitical/regulatory signals affecting semiconductor shipments to key markets.
- Data points to watch once signals return: hyperscaler AI spend, data-center install rates, ASP/margin trajectory, and any notebook/desktop refresh cycles impacting demand mix.

## Price Action Technicals
- Key levels to watch:
  - **Support: $95**; next support around **$90**  
  - **Immediate resistance: $110–$112**  
  - **Breakout resistance: $125**; target zones toward **$135–$140** on sustained strength
- Trend cues:
  - Above **$112**: bullish bias strengthens; look for pullbacks to test support near **$110–$112** as potential entries
  - Below **$95**: risk of trend downside; consider defensive sizing or hedges

## Trading Scenarios
- Base Case
  - View: constructive with data-center demand holding; range around current levels
  - Entry: near **$100–$105**; add on break above **$112**
  - Targets: **$115–$120** initially; then **$125–$130** on sustained breakout
  - Stop: **$95** (tight risk control)
- Bull Case
  - View: data-center AI capex accelerates; margins stabilize or improve
  - Entry: above **$125**
  - Targets: **$135–$140**; potential to extend toward $150 with broad AI/tech rally
  - Stop: **$120**
- Bear Case
  - View: PC softness and AI price/volume pressure weigh on margins
  - Break risk: below **$95**
  - Targets: **$85–$90**; further downside toward **$80–$82** if breakdown persists
  - Stop: **$98**

## Key Data Points Summary
- Macro signals to monitor: CPI/PCE, unemployment, PMI, USD index
- AMD-specific signals to watch (when data returns): hyperscaler data-center capex commentary, AI deployment announcements, Instinct/MI roadmap progress, ASP/margin trajectory, foundry capacity news
- Competitive context: Nvidia’s data-center AI uptake and pricing dynamics; Intel AMD market positioning
- Geopolitics: export controls/subsidies affecting semiconductor supply chains

Notes:
- Data-feed-dependent signals will be appended once tool access is restored. In the interim, use the above levels and scenarios for risk-managed positioning.
