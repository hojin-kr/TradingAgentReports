Recommendation: Hold

Rationale (why Hold aligns with the plan)
- The bull case for AMD’s data-center trajectory is real but not yet proven durable. We need multiple quarters of sustained data-center momentum and margin expansion to re-rate the stock.
- Near-term headwinds remain credible: competitive moat from Nvidia, execution and supply-chain uncertainties, and macro cyclicality in consumer GPU demand can temper growth and margin upside.
- Valuation sensitivity: even with potential margin gains, the stock remains at a high-growth multiple that can compress if growth stalls or if supply/timing risks materialize.
- The provided plan’s logic is prudent: wait for clear, multi-quarter evidence of durable momentum, enterprise/AI mix improvement, and stable supply before committing meaningfully more capital.

Key conditions and triggers
- Upgrade to Buy if observed for two consecutive quarters:
  - Data-center revenue growth accelerates to a 12-15% QoQ range, with rising accelerator mix and stable/upward ASPs.
  - Gross margin expands for two straight quarters driven by higher-value enterprise/software mix and operating leverage.
  - Clear, durable demand signals from hyperscalers with limited channel risk and no material supply delays.
  - Supply conditions stabilize or improve (lead times favorable, no material ramp delays).
- Prune or revert to Sell if observed for two consecutive quarters:
  - Data-center growth stalls or declines; accelerator mix and ASPs compress meaningfully.
  - Margin durability deteriorates despite enterprise mix, or cash flow weakens due to capex pressures.
  - Recurrent supply/disruption issues or delays in next-gen packaging/node with no compensating demand strength.

Risk controls and execution notes
- Position sizing: moderate exposure (core AMD 1-3% of portfolio, adjusted for overall risk budget).
- Hedging: consider long AMD with put protection or a collar to limit downside while preserving upside if momentum improves.
- Cadence: quarterly reviews focused on data-center momentum, ASP trends, enterprise adoption signals, and supplier/lead-time news.
- Stops: use ATR-based stops or a specified 10-15% trailing downside trigger from average entry.

Operational path
- If staying in Hold: continue monitoring and avoid heavy additions until confirmable multi-quarter momentum emerges.
- If risk signals worsen: reduce exposure and reassess, with hedges as a fallback.
- Time horizon: 6–12 months, with flexibility to extend if momentum proves durable.

Bottom line
- Hold: the balanced risk-reward supports a cautious stance now, pending clearer, durable multi-quarter evidence of sustained data-center momentum and margin expansion before considering a Buy.
