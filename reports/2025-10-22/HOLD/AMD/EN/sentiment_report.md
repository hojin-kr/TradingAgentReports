Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for AMD for 2025-10-22, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError internal error. It looks like the data fetch service is currently unavailable or misconfigured on my end.

What I can do right now
- Acknowledge the issue and lay out a plan to proceed as soon as the data tool is back.
- Prepare a full, trader-focused AMD report skeleton so we’re ready to populate it the moment the data feed works again.
- If you’d like, I can also switch to or supplement with other sources (e.g., other social platforms or headlines) once we have permission or if you’d like me to proceed without the Reddit data for now.

Proposed next steps
1) Retry data fetch now or after a short interval
- If you want, I can try again in a few minutes and then compile the report with the new data.

2) Build out a comprehensive AMD report skeleton (ready to populate)
- I’ll structure a long-form report with sections tailored for traders, including detailed sentiment interpretation, news impact, and actionable implications. I will add a markdown table at the end summarizing key takeaways.

3) Alternative data approach (optional)
- If you’re okay with it, I can produce an interim report using qualitative signals from other sources (e.g., general sentiment themes on social, notable AMD news headlines from the past week) and clearly flag data gaps until the Reddit tool is back.

Draft of AMD-focused long report structure (ready to fill with data)
- Executive snapshot
  - Brief market context for AMD (recent earnings, guidance, competitive landscape)
  - Summary sentiment trend (positive/negative/mixed) with key drivers
- Social sentiment overview (past week)
  - Day-by-day sentiment split (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Top sentiment drivers (e.g., AI demand, gaming GPU pricing, supply chain, data center growth)
  - Notable anecdotes or memes that moved sentiment
- News and events (past 7 days)
  - Bullet list of major AMD news mentions, product launches, partnerships, supply-chain updates
  - Immediate market impact (price reaction, volume, volatility)
- Thematic drivers and context
  - AI acceleration and data center demand
  - GPU supply/demand dynamics and pricing trends
  - Competitor actions (NVIDIA, Intel) and their sentiment spillovers
  - Any regulatory or macro factors relevant to semis
- Sentiment-to-price implications
  - How the current sentiment aligns with price action, option activity, or unusual volumes
  - Short-term vs. longer-term implications
- Risk factors and caveats
  - Key risk mentions in sentiment data
  - Possible data biases or gaps
- Trader-oriented takeaways
  - Possible trade scaffolds (e.g., if sentiment strengthens on AI catalysts, consider X; if sentiment deteriorates on supply concerns, consider Y)
  - Timeframes and risk controls
- Data notes
  - Sources used, data windows, confidence levels, and any limitations
- Endnote: Next steps
  - What to monitor in the next 1–2 weeks

Markdown table (example structure to be filled after data is available)
- A table summarizing: Date, Day’s Sentiment (Pos/Neu/Neg), Key Sentiment Drivers, Major News, Price Move (%), Volatility, Suggested Trade View
- This helps traders quickly scan the week’s sentiment landscape and news impact.

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now and then proceed with the full report?
- Proceed with the interim report using only available sources (clearly flagged as incomplete data), or
- Start with the full report skeleton now and fill in details as soon as we have the Reddit feed back?

If you prefer, I can also draft the full, ready-to-fill report and the markdown table right away, with placeholders for data points, so you just need to drop in the numbers when the tool becomes available.
