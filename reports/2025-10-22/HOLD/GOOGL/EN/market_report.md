I attempted to fetch GOOGL price data for 2024-10-22 to 2025-10-22 but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t access the actual price/time-series right now. I’ll still set up a robust, multi-indicator framework tailored to GOOGL and outline how I’ll interpret the signals once the data is available. If you’d like, I can retry the data pull now or proceed with a concrete scenario once you confirm.

Selected indicators (8) and why they’re complementary
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for filtering entries in conjunction with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Defines the long-term trend benchmark and can confirm major trend regime (golden/death cross contexts). Slower but strong contextual anchor.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures quick momentum shifts and can highlight early entry points when aligned with larger trend indicators.
- macd: MACD line. Core momentum indicator showing differences between two EMAs; useful for crossovers and divergence in trend strength.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoothing of the MACD line; crossovers with the MACD line trigger signals and help reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index. Momentum gauge; signals overbought/oversold and potential reversals; good for spotting divergences in conjunction with trend context.
- atr: Average True Range. Measures volatility; essential for setting stops and sizing positions in a manner that adapts to current volatility.
- vwma: Volume-Weighted Moving Average. Combines price action with volume to confirm the strength behind moves; helps distinguish genuine moves from volume-driven noise.

How I’ll interpret these together (once data is available)
- Bullish alignment (prospective setup):
  - Price trades above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, preferably with the 50 SMA above the 200 SMA (uptrend).
  - close_10_ema is above the 50 SMA or is crossing upward, signaling stronger near-term momentum.
  - MACD line above the MACD signal, with MACD histogram trending positive, indicating sustained momentum.
  - RSI rising but not overbought (ideally < 70) to avoid early reversal risk.
  - VWMA sits above price or price challenges the VWMA with increasing volume, indicating momentum with conviction.
  - ATR trending higher confirms expanding volatility in a breakout context, not a squeeze.
  Interpretation: Trigger entries on a modest pullback toward dynamic support (e.g., near the 50 SMA or the confluence of the 50 SMA and VWMA) with a tight stop derived from ATR. Tilt sizing to reflect the volatility regime.

- Bearish alignment (prospective setup):
  - Price below 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with potential cross of 50 below 200 indicating downtrend.
  - close_10_ema crossing below or failing to clear above longer-term averages.
  - MACD line below MACD signal, with decreasing histogram, signaling weakening momentum.
  - RSI rolling toward or below 50, possibly approaching oversold territory but not yet reversing.
  - VWMA below price or price failing to hold VWMA support; volume confirms the move’s legitimacy.
  - ATR rising on downside moves suggests a true breakout, not a false pullback, requiring disciplined risk controls.
  Interpretation: Consider hedging or waiting for a stronger confirmatory signal (e.g., MACD cross with price action and a bounce from VWMA support) before entering short or adding to shorts.

- Consolidation/transition (neutral):
  - Price oscillating around the 50 and 200 SMAs with narrow ATR; MACD and RSI around midlines; VWMA alternating around price.
  Interpretation: Favor range-trading tactics, or wait for a clear breakout/false-break signal with volume support and a confirmatory MACD cross.

Trading approach considerations
- Entry signals: Prefer an alignment where multiple indicators support a move (e.g., price above 50/200 SMAs, MACD bullish crossover with histogram rising, RSI climbing from oversold but not overbought, and VWMA confirming volume-backed momentum).
- Stops and risk: Use ATR-based stops to adapt to current volatility; e.g., stop distance could be 1.0x–2.0x ATR depending on risk tolerance and position size.
- Position sizing: Scale with volatility (e.g., smaller sizes on higher ATR days) and ensure a reasonable risk per trade (commonly 0.5%–2% of account equity per trade).
- Time horizon: This blend supports both tactical swing trades (using 10 EMA and MACD for entries) and longer-term trend confirmation (50/200 SMA, RSI trend-dynamics).

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry the data pull now and then deliver a focused, data-driven trend report with exact values (price, SMAs, MACD lines, RSI, ATR, VWMA) and concrete signals for GOOGL.
- Alternatively, if you have a preferred date range or a cached dataset you can share, I can analyze that directly.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | What it measures | How it helps | Expected behavior in bullish context |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day trendline | Trend direction, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50 SMA; potential pullback to this level as a buying opportunity |
| close_200_sma | 200-day trendline | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above 200 SMA signals bullish regime; cross with 50 SMA strengthens uptrend context |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick momentum shifts, potential entries | 10 EMA above longer averages; possible early entry sign when aligned with MACD/RSI |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Crossovers, momentum strength, divergence | MACD line above MACD signal with positive histogram supports bullish moves |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoother confirmation of momentum changes | MACD signal cross with MACD line reinforces entry/exit signals |
| rsi | Momentum oscillator | Overbought/oversold, divergences | RSI rising toward mid-to-high range supports upside, avoid overbought extremes without confirmation |
| atr | Volatility | Stop placement, position sizing | Rising ATR suggests larger stop radius; use for risk controls around breakouts |
| vwma | Volume-weighted trend | Price action with volume, move authenticity | Price action backed by rising VWMA signals stronger, volume-confirmed trend |

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now, say “retry,” and I’ll attempt another fetch for GOOGL data and then deliver a data-driven, fully fleshed-out trend report with concrete observations and signals.
