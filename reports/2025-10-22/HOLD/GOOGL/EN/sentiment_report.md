Thanks for the details. I tried to fetch the Reddit data for GOOGL on 2025-10-22, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool issue). I can retry immediately, or we can proceed with a best-effort analysis using available data sources and clearly note what’s missing until the Reddit feed comes back online. Which would you prefer?

If you’d like me to proceed now, here’s how I’ll structure the long report and what I’ll include as soon as the Reddit data is accessible:

- Executive snapshot
  - High-level sentiment direction for the past week
  - Notable catalysts (news events, earnings hints, policy/regulatory chatter)

- Daily sentiment and trend analysis
  - Day-by-day sentiment scores (positive vs. negative vs. neutral)
  - Key drivers per day (e.g., major threads, notable posts, influencer activity)
  - Volume of discussion and engagement metrics (comments, upvotes)

- Top topics and themes
  - What people are talking about (AI initiatives, regulatory concerns, product announcements, antitrust chatter, etc.)
  - Framing and sentiment of each theme (bullish vs bearish vs neutral)

- Influencers and credibility signals
  - Which accounts or communities are driving the chatter
  - Credibility indicators (repetition, cross-posting, verified sources)

- Correlation with news and events
  - Alignment between social sentiment and recent company news or macro factors
  - Any discordance between news catalysts and social reception

- Risk and opportunity signals for traders
  - Short-term sentiment swing risks (e.g., meme-like spikes, rumor-driven moves)
  - Long-tail sentiment trends (sustainability of bullish or bearish narratives)
  - Potential entry/exit inflection points based on sentiment shifts

- Quantitative sentiment insights (if available)
  - Overall sentiment score
  - Positive/negative sentiment deltas over the week
  - Top positive and top negative threads by engagement

- Macro context and company-specific considerations
  - How Alphabet/GOOGL sentiment compares to broader tech and AI narratives
  - Key company news or product developments that could influence sentiment

- Practical trader takeaways
  - Short-term implications (next 1–5 days)
  - Medium-term implications (2–6 weeks)
  - Watchlist triggers and risk controls

- Appendix and data notes
  - Data sources, assumptions, and caveats
  - Limitations due to data gaps

If you want me to proceed right now with the above framework, I’ll retry the Reddit data pull first and then fill in the report with the latest available signals. Alternatively, I can start with a detailed outline and placeholders, and fill in the numbers as soon as the Reddit tool comes back online.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit fetch now, or proceed with the outline and a best-effort qualitative draft in the meantime?
