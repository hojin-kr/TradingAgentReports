Sorry about that — I hit an internal error while trying to fetch Reddit data for QQQ. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t access the Reddit-based sentiment data right now.

How would you like to proceed?
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately.
- Alternative data sources: I can proceed with a structured analysis framework using other accessible sources (e.g., general market sentiment signals, news headlines, macro context) if you provide access or authorize me to fetch from other platforms.
- Interim plan: I can share the outline and the exact analysis approach I will run once the Reddit tool is available again, so you know exactly what to expect.

If you want me to proceed with an interim plan, here’s what the final long report will cover (once data is available), so you can decide which path to take:
- Overview: current state of QQQ sentiment on social media and news headlines over the past 1–7 days.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: day-by-day sentiment scores, notable spikes, and potential catalysts (economic data releases, earnings macros, policy news).
- Top themes and sentiment drivers: overcrowded longs, profit-taking chatter, risk-off moves, comparisons to major indices, sector/tech rotation signals.
- Sentiment vs. price action: how sentiment moves align with QQQ price, volume, and volatility metrics; identification of lag/lead relationships.
- News overlay: summarization of latest macro, tech, and ETF-specific news that could be driving sentiment.
- Trader implications: actionable takeaways for short-term trading (intraday to 2–5 days) and for longer-term positioning; risk considerations and potential setups.
- Scenarios and micro-cases: best-case, base-case, and worst-case sentiment/implied-vol expectations with trigger levels.
- Quick-hits table: a concise reference of key datapoints, themes, catalysts, and risks.
- Markdown table: a summarized, easy-to-scan table at the end with key points, watch items, and recommended actions.

If you prefer, I can also start by retrying the Reddit fetch immediately and, in parallel, begin compiling the report framework so we can integrate the Reddit insights as soon as the tool works again. Please tell me which option you’d like.
