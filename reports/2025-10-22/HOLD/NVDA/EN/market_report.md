Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch NVDA data and compute the selected indicators, but I hit a data-access error (FileNotFoundError) from the data tools. Because the indicators rely on fresh price data, I can’t produce a reliable trend report yet. I can retry pulling the data right away, or adjust parameters if you’d like. Here’s how I propose to proceed and what I can deliver once the data is accessible.

What I will do (once data access works)
- Pull NVDA price data for a meaningful window (e.g., ~2 years up to 2025-10-22).
- Compute up to 8 complementary indicators (no redundancy) from your list.
- Produce a detailed, nuanced report describing current trends, momentum, volatility, and volume context, with concrete observations for potential trading decisions.
- Append a Markdown table at the end summarizing key points for quick reference.

Selected indicators (8 indicators, no redundancy)
- close_10_ema
  Why: Captures short-term momentum and rapid shifts; good for early entry/exit signals when used with longer-term filters.
- close_50_sma
  Why: Medium-term trend direction; acts as dynamic support/resistance and helps confirm primary trend.
- close_200_sma
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming broad direction (Golden/Death cross context but more for confirmation than frequent entries).
- macd
  Why: Momentum crossovers and divergence help identify potential trend changes; useful in conjunction with trend filters.
- macds
  Why: Smoother signal line; crossovers with MACD line provide trading triggers within a broader framework.
- rsi
  Why: Momentum gauge for overbought/oversold and potential reversals, with divergence signals to watch against trend context.
- atr
  Why: Measures volatility; critical for sizing and stop placement, especially for a high-volatility name like NVDA.
- vwma
  Why: Volume-weighted trend confirmation; helps corroborate price moves with participation level, reducing false signals in low-volume spikes.

What I’ll deliver after data retrieval
- A detailed, granular narrative of NVDA’s trend and momentum, including:
  - How price interacts with the 10 EMA, 50 SMA, and 200 SMA (crossovers, support/resistance zones, alignment with long-term trend).
  - MACD/macd signals in the context of current price action (crossover signals, histogram strength, divergence with price).
  - RSI positioning relative to 30/70 thresholds, potential reversals, and any divergence with price or momentum indicators.
  - ATR-driven volatility insights to inform risk management and stop placement.
  - VWMA confirmation of trend when volume supports the price move (or flags weak/ divergent volume).
  - Any notable divergences between momentum indicators (MACD, RSI) and price action, with suggested interpretations.
- A concise, actionable set of takeaways for NVDA (e.g., trend direction bias, potential entry/exit zones, risk considerations).
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick reference.

Proposed next step
- I can retry pulling NVDA data and computing the eight indicators now. If you’d like, I’ll proceed with:
  - symbol: NVDA
  - date window: 2023-10-22 to 2025-10-22 (or adjust to a shorter window if you prefer)
  - indicators: the eight listed above

Please confirm you’d like me to retry data retrieval now. If you prefer, you can also specify:
- a different date range
- a smaller subset of indicators (for faster turnaround)

Note: If the data service continues to be unavailable, I’ll still provide a robust framework analysis and explain how each indicator would typically inform NVDA’s setup in a high-volatility, AI-driven stock context, so you can use the framework immediately while we re-establish data access.
