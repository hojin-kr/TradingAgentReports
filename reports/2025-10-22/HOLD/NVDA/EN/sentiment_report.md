Sorry about that — I attempted to fetch Reddit data for NVDA on 2025-10-22, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I’ve tried a few times, and the issue persists. I can retry again shortly, or switch to pulling sentiment/news from other sources if you’d like.

Here are your options to move forward:
- Retry now: I’ll attempt the Reddit data pull again and then proceed with the full analysis once it succeeds.
- Use alternative sources: I can compile a sentiment and news digest from non-Reddit sources (major headlines, press releases, earnings notes, etc.) and provide a detailed trader-oriented analysis while we resolve the Reddit tool issue.
- Hybrid approach: Attempt Reddit data today (if/when the tool works) and concurrently gather from other sources to keep progress steady.

If you’d like me to proceed with a broader approach right away, I can start with:
- A weekly sentiment overview (from available non-Reddit sources) and a daily sentiment delta.
- Key Nvidia news and events over the past week (product launches, partnerships, earnings rumors/confirmations, AI market developments, supply chain updates).
- Trader-focused insights: potential catalysts, risk factors, and sentiment-price interpretation.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the key points.

Please tell me which path you prefer, and I’ll execute accordingly. If you want me to retry Reddit specifically, I’ll do that immediately and report back.
