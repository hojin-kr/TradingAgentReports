Sorry about that — I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock news for PLTR on 2025-10-22, but the data fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t retrieve the Reddit data right now due to that tool issue.

I can proceed in a couple of ways. Please tell me which you’d prefer:
1) Retry fetching Reddit stock data now (if you want me to keep trying in real time). I’ll report back as soon as it succeeds or fails again.
2) Proceed with a comprehensive, high-quality qualitative analysis using all other available sources and a structured framework, with a placeholder table for Reddit data until the fetch tool is working again. This will still give traders actionable insights.

If you’d like me to proceed now with option 2, here is a draft of the long-form PLTR analysis and a Markdown table structure you can expect at the end. This is a framework you can use to quickly drop in data once the Reddit tool is functioning again.

Draft PLTR analysis framework (social sentiment, news, and trader implications) — ready to populate with data
- Executive snapshot
  - What traders should watch in the near term: AI/Foundry product momentum, enterprise adoption, government/commercial contract activity, earnings trajectory, and any shifts in margins or operating expenses.
  - Key risk factors: competition in commercial AI analytics, regulatory/compliance scrutiny around data privacy, and sensitivity to macro sentiment about growth vs. profitability.

- Social sentiment analysis approach (what I’ll measure)
  - Volume: total mentions of PLTR across Reddit and other social channels over the past 7–14 days.
  - Mood: net sentiment (positive vs negative) and how it changes day-to-day.
  - Top themes: recurring topics (Foundry adoption, pricing, integrations, competitor comparisons, leadership commentary).
  - Anomalies: spikes tied to contracts, product launches, or earnings guidance.
  - Spillover risk: how social sentiment correlates with implied volatility, option flow, and short interest changes.

- Recent news flow (what to track)
  - AI/Foundry: updates on product capabilities, datasets, platform integrations, and customer wins.
  - Government/commercial mix: any contract renewals, expansions, or new verticals (defense, healthcare, financial services).
  - Financials: earnings results, revenue mix changes (commercial vs government), gross/margin trends, guidance.
  - Partnerships and ecosystem: notable alliances (cloud/integration partners), channel programs, or deployment case studies.
  - Regulation and geopolitics: data privacy or export controls that could affect enterprise adoption.

- Sentiment drivers and implications for traders
  - Positive sentiment catalysts: stronger-than-expected commercial traction, higher ARR, favorable guidance, durable margins, or major enterprise wins.
  - Negative sentiment catalysts: slowing commercial growth, higher customer churn risk, margin compression, or delays in product rollouts.
  - Implication for price action: a persistent tilt in sentiment (positive or negative) can precede or accompany moves in relative strength, RSI, and IV.

- Key catalysts and risks next 4–8 weeks
  - Catalysts: upcoming earnings, contract announcements, product launches, or large-scale customer deployments.
  - Risks: macro tech spending softness, competition (e.g., from other analytics platforms), or a misstep on monetization strategy.

- Trader takeaways and strategies
  - If sentiment tilts positive with evidence of commercial momentum: consider upside-oriented strategies (e.g., call spreads or ladders) while watching for over-extension via momentum indicators.
  - If sentiment tilts negative or news flow dampens growth expectations: consider hedged or defensive approaches (e.g., collar strategies, or puts near key support levels) and monitor option flow for tail risk.
  - Risk management: track short-interest, flow of large block trades, and any changes in institutional ownership that might precede price moves.

- Data table (structure to fill in)
  - I will populate this with daily Reddit sentiment data and other sources when available.

Example Markdown table (to be filled with data once available)
- Note: The table below is a template. Replace TBD with actual figures once the data fetch succeeds.

| Date (UTC) | Source | Sentiment (Net) | Mention Volume | Key Theme(s) | Potential Impact on PLTR | Trader Takeaway |
|------------|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 2025-10-22 | Reddit (PLTR) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2025-10-21 | Reddit (PLTR) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2025-10-20 | Reddit (PLTR) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Next steps
- If you want me to retry now, I’ll fire off another fetch for PLTR Reddit stock data for 2025-10-22 and incorporate it into the report as soon as it returns.
- If you prefer to proceed with the qualitative framework immediately, I’ll begin drafting a full narrative report with live sentiment signals from other sources and a filled-out table as data becomes available.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and whether you’d like me to start with option 1 (retry) or option 2 (qualitative analysis now).
