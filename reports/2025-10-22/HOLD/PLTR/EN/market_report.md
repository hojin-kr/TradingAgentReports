I’m trying to pull PLTR data to run the indicators, but the data-fetch tool is currently failing with a file-not-found error. I’ve tried multiple date ranges, and the issue appears on the data source side. I can:

- Retry the data pull now, or
- Proceed with a robust, data-driven plan that outlines how we’ll analyze once data is available, or
- Do a qualitative, non-data-driven analysis in the meantime (less precise)

Please tell me which option you prefer. In the meantime, here’s a concrete plan with a recommended set of up to 8 indicators tailored for PLTR (Palantir Technologies). This set emphasizes diverse, non-redundant signals (trend, momentum, and volatility) and is designed to give you a balanced view once data is accessible.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these are suitable for PLTR
- Trend framework (50 SMA and 200 SMA): PLTR is a volatile growth tech stock; the 50 SMA vs 200 SMA helps identify medium- to long-term trend direction and potential support/resistance zones. A golden cross (50 SMA crossing above 200 SMA) would be a bullish signal to watch, while a death cross would warrant caution.
- Short-term momentum (close_10_ema, MACD family): The 10 EMA tracks quicker shifts in price, useful for near-term entries or exits in a volatile stock like PLTR. MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram together provide crossovers, momentum strength, and divergence information to confirm or question trend signals.
- Momentum strength and conditions (RSI): RSI flags overbought/oversold conditions and can reveal divergences with price, offering potential reversal or consolidation cues when used with trend indicators.
- Volatility context (ATR): ATR helps quantify current volatility and supports risk management decisions (e.g., setting stop distances and position sizing during period of elevated volatility, which PLTR commonly experiences).

How I’ll interpret signals once data is available
- Trend cues
  - Price above 50 SMA and 200 SMA: bullish bias; look for 50 SMA crossing above 200 SMA (golden cross) as confirmation.
  - Price below these averages or a cross of 50 below 200: bearish bias; watch for potential trend changes or consolidation.
- Momentum cues
  - MACD line crossing above MACD Signal and MACD Histogram expanding upwards: bullish momentum; consider long entries with proper risk controls.
  - MACD divergences (price makes new highs while MACD fails to) or MACD turning negative: caution or potential reversals.
  - RSI above 70: overbought risk; in a strong uptrend it can stay elevated, so confirm with trend direction and MACD.
  - RSI near or below 30: oversold risk; look for bullish confirmations from trend or MACD to avoid premature entries in a downtrend.
- Volatility/risk cues
  - Rising ATR: higher volatility; widen stops or reduce position size accordingly.
  - Falling ATR: waning volatility; look for tighter stops and potential range-bound setups.

Next steps
- Option 1: I retry data retrieval now. If successful, I’ll generate a detailed, data-driven report with the 8 indicators and a structured interpretation for PLTR, including a concise set of actionable signals.
- Option 2: If you prefer not to wait, I can provide a qualitative, non-data-driven walkthrough of how these indicators would typically interact for PLTR, along with example signal interpretations you could monitor once data loads.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | Category | Purpose | What to look for | Possible action cues for PLTR |
|-----------|----------|---------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Trend direction, dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50 SMA; 50 SMA relative to 200 SMA | Bullish if price stays above and 50 crosses above 200; bearish if below or cross occurs |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above/below 200 SMA | Confirm bullish/bearish regime; possible strategic bias adjustments |
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum | Price above/below 10 EMA; cross with price | Quick entry/exit signals; use with longer-term filters |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum shift | MACD line crossing MACD Signal; histogram trends | Buy/sell signals when aligned with price trend; use as confirmation |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD | Changes in MACD Signal direction | Confirm MACD-driven entries or exits |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction | Strength of move; watch for divergence from price | 
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold, momentum strength | RSI >70 overbought; RSI <30 oversold; potential divergence | Reversals or pullbacks; categorize entry/exit risk |
| atr | Volatility | Volatility and risk management | Rising/falling ATR; adjust stops/position size | Increase protection during high volatility; tighten during calm periods |

If you’d like me to retry the data fetch now and proceed with the full, data-driven report, say “retry now,” and I’ll attempt another fetch and then generate the detailed PLTR analysis with the 8 indicators.
