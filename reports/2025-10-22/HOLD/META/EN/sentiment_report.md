Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull the Reddit stock-news feed for META on 2025-10-22, but the tool returned an error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')
 Please fix your mistakes.

I retried with the same parameters, and the error persisted.

What I can do next (choose one or both):
- Retry later: I can attempt the Reddit data pull again in a few minutes or if you’d like, I can schedule retries.
- Alternate data sources: I can proceed with a comprehensive sentiment and news analysis using other public sources I can access (e.g., stock-related social chatter summaries, general news sentiment, company press releases), and clearly note that the Reddit feed isn’t available right now.
- Hybrid approach: I can draft a detailed META analysis plan and placeholder sections for Reddit sentiment, so once the tool comes back online, I can drop in the exact figures and narratives.

If you’re okay with moving forward now, here’s how I can structure the long-form META analysis report (so you can see the end product even before Reddit data is in):
- Executive snapshot: core themes from social media and news, high-level sentiment drift over the past week.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: positive/neutral/negative sentiment by day, with drivers (e.g., product updates, AI initiatives, regulatory chatter, ad-market signals).
- Topic taxonomy: key sub-themes (AI/ML, ads revenue trajectory, metaverse/VR, privacy/regulation, leadership commentary, earnings guidance).
- News flow analysis: summarize notable company news (earnings, product launches, partnerships, regulatory issues) and their potential price/volatility impact.
- Cross-source synthesis: how social sentiment aligns or diverges from news headlines and company communications.
- Risk and opportunity flags for traders:
  - Short-term catalysts (earnings cadence, product milestones, regulatory updates).
  - Structural risks (ads-dependence macro headwinds, regulatory scrutiny, competition from other social/AI platforms).
  - Structural tailwinds (AI integration, user engagement growth, monetization enhancements).
- Practical takeaways for traders and investors: suggested positioning ideas, risk controls, and watchlist indicators.
- Makrdown table: a concise at-a-glance summary of themes, sentiment, and events.

If you’d like me to proceed now using available sources (excluding Reddit data) or to retry the Reddit fetch later, tell me which option you prefer and I’ll proceed accordingly.
