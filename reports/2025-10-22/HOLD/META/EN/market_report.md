I attempted to fetch the data and run the indicator analyses for META, but I encountered a tool environment error (FileNotFoundError) when requesting data. Here’s a best-effort analysis using a carefully selected set of indicators that provide complementary insights. Once the data fetch succeeds, I can produce a data-driven trend readout and signal counts for META.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- vwma

Why these 8 indicators are suitable for META
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: These give a clear sense of the medium- and long-term trend. META, being a large-cap tech/advertising stock, can exhibit persistent trends around earnings cycles and platform monetization news. The 50-day and 200-day SMAs help you gauge whether price is in an uptrend, downtrend, or range, and can act as dynamic support/resistance zones.
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum gauge that can help identify quicker shifts around intraday news or earnings. It’s useful for timing entries when price is aligning with longer-term trend signals.
- macd, macds, macdh: The MACD family provides a robust momentum framework:
  - macd: The core momentum line.
  - macds: The signal line that smooths MACD, useful for crossovers.
  - macdh: The histogram showing momentum strength and divergence potential.
  Together, they help confirm trend changes and the strength behind moves, particularly around earnings or product announcements.
- rsi: A momentum oscillator that flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Important for META where sentiment and news can push conditions into overextended territory even within a broader trend.
- vwma: Volume-weighted moving average adds a volume-confirmation layer. META trades with substantial daily volumes; using VWMA helps verify that price moves are supported by stronger-than-average volume, which reduces the risk of false breakouts in a light-volume context.

How these indicators complement each other (without redundancy)
- Trend confirmation (50/200 SMA) paired with a short-term momentum signal (10 EMA and MACD family) provides both direction and timing.
- RSI adds a momentum-structure check for potential pullbacks or reversals that align with the MACD signals.
- VWMA adds a volume-filter to validate that momentum-driven moves have substantive participation, which is critical for meta’s price moves around headlines and earnings.

What to watch for META in this framework (interpretive guide)
- Bullish scenario: Price stays above the 50 SMA and ideally crosses above the 200 SMA (golden cross risk if applicable over a longer horizon). MACD line crosses above the signal line with an increasing histogram (macd rising, macdh positive), RSI moves into the mid-to-upper range without extreme overbought (e.g., 50–70), and price action is supported by above-average volume (VWMA price cross or stay above VWMA with rising volume).
- Bearish scenario: Price trades below both SMAs or shows a crossing of price below the 50 SMA with MACD below zero and MACD histogram turning negative (macdh negative or widening). RSI trending down toward 30–40, with weakening VWMA-confirmed volume on pullbacks.
- Neutral or range-bound: Price oscillates around the 50 SMA with MACD showing weak momentum (small macdh), RSI hovering around 40–60, and VWMA showing inconsistent volume support. Signals in this state are generally less actionable without a broader trend cue.

Potential trading considerations and signals (practical use)
- Entry signals (long): Price above 50 SMA and above 200 SMA (or a strong hold above 50 with 200 trending up), MACD>0 with macdh turning positive or rising, RSI above 40–50 but not overbought, and price action confirmed with VWMA above price or rising volume to confirm strength.
- Entry signals (short): Price below 50 SMA and 200 SMA, MACD<0 with macdh turning negative, RSI in 40s or 30s (not extreme oversold unless a clear reversal setup), and VWMA showing volume behind the move (ideally rising on a down-move if a break occurs).
- Risk management: Use a volatility-informed stop concept by referencing relative volatility in the setup (e.g., not directly an indicator in this selected set, but considering a risk-based approach around earnings or product-cycle news). If you re-include ATR or another volatility measure later, you can refine stops based on recent true ranges.

Limitations and next steps
- Data availability: The current data fetch failed due to a tool environment error. Once the data retrieval is successful, I will produce a data-driven trend report for META on 2025-10-22, including signal counts, momentum strength, and a concrete interpretation of the latest bar-by-bar context.
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now and re-run the indicator outputs as soon as the tool environment is functional again.

Markdown table: Key indicators and roles for META
| Indicator | Role / What it tells you | How to interpret in META context | Trade-context notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance | Above implies bullish bias; below implies bearish bias; moves relative to 50SMA gauge momentum strength | Use for trend direction; pair with MACD/RSI to time entries |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA signals long-term uptrend; below signals long-term weakness | Useful for strategic positioning and filtering entries |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum; faster signals | Crossing above price or other averages indicates near-term momentum shift | Helps time swing entries around the broader trend |
| macd | Core momentum signal | Positive MACD with rising histogram suggests strengthening uptrend; negative with falling histogram suggests weakness | Use in conjunction with price relative to SMAs and VWMA for confirmation |
| macds | MACD signal line | MACDS crossing MACD can trigger entries; crossovers add confirmation | Combine with MACD and RSI to reduce false positives |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Magnitude of momentum; divergence early warning | Use to spot momentum weakening/strengthening ahead of price moves |
| rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold | RSI rising toward 70+ can indicate overbought; falling toward 30s indicates oversold; look for divergences | Cross-checks with trend and MACD to avoid false reversals |
| vwma | Volume-confirmed trends | Price movement supported by higher volume (VWMA) adds validity to breakouts or declines | Prioritize trades where price action aligns with VWMA direction and volume strength |

Next actions
- I can re-run the data fetch and generate a detailed, data-backed narrative for META as soon as the tool environment permits.
- If you want to proceed immediately, I can proceed with a purely qualitative interpretation using these indicators and plan potential trading ideas, or you can provide the latest price data and I’ll compute the indicator readings manually and deliver a precise trend assessment. 
Would you like me to retry data retrieval now, or should I proceed with a qualitative, signal-based plan based on these indicators?
