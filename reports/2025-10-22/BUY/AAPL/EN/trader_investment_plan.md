Decision: Buy Apple (AAPL)

Rationale (summary):
- Durable growth optionality: iPhone momentum supports hardware profitability while Services provides a high-margin, recurring engine. The potential of AI-enabled monetization across devices and services adds optionality without sacrificing privacy.
- Ecosystem moat and balance sheet: Strong brand, integrated hardware-software-services, and a robust balance sheet support resilient cash flows and shareholder value through buybacks and dividends.
- Manageable bear risks: Valuation is rich and regulatory/regime risks exist, but these can be mitigated with hedging and disciplined risk controls. upside from AI monetization and Services growth remains a meaningful driver.

Implementation plan (actionable):
- Position sizing: Core long position 3–6% of the equities sleeve. If not already owned, initiate at current levels and plan to add on confirmed momentum.
- Hedging to cap downside (collar approach preferred):
  - Long stock plus: buy 1–2% of portfolio worth of near-term to 3–6 month puts (at- or slightly in-the-money) to establish a floor.
  - Sell calls at a higher strike to offset put cost and maintain some upside capture.
  - Size hedges so total hedged portion remains within your overall risk budget (e.g., hedge 1–2% to protect against outsized drawdowns).
- Alternative hedge (if-cost constraints): buy modest out-of-the-money puts (1–2% of portfolio) for 1–2 years, with careful sizing to avoid over-hedging.
- Optionality strategy: If earnings power and AI monetization milestones become clearer, consider a targeted call-spread overlay to participate in upside beyond the hedge while preserving core exposure.
- Entry/exit gates:
  - Add on constructive price action: price above rising 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD positive or turning up, RSI not overbought.
  - Trim/hedge further on breakdowns below key trendlines or moving averages; reassess hedges if macro/regulatory headlines intensify.
- Earnings and catalysts: Size exposure ahead of earnings with hedges in place; scale in on constructive commentary and AI monetization milestones; reduce on disappointment.
- Risk controls:
  - Implement a trailing stop or a price-based stop linked to moving averages for the core long.
  - Maintain a defined risk budget for hedges; avoid letting hedges overwhelm core exposure.
- Diversification and scenarios: Do not single-name risk; balance with other quality tech and defensives. Run base/bear/bull scenario analyses to adjust hedge levels as macro/regulatory headlines evolve.

Next steps:
- If you want, I can translate this into exact notional amounts, precise put/call strikes, and specific trigger levels aligned to your portfolio size and risk tolerance. I’ll update the plan with live data and generate concrete entry/exit prices and hedge notional when available.

Lessons applied:
- Rely on risk controls and hedges rather than hype to manage downside.
- Use scenario-based sizing to reflect base/bear/bull cases.
- Ground entry/exit in measurable signals (moving averages, MACD, RSI) rather than momentum alone.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
