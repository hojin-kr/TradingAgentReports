Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AAPL data and compute the requested indicators, but the data retrieval tool is currently returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can't pull the latest price series or compute the indicator values at the moment. I’ll outline a robust, complementary indicator set (up to 8) and explain how to interpret them for AAPL once the data is available. When the data tools are working, you can run these exact indicators and I can then synthesize the live readings into actionable signals.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators) and rationale
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - What it measures: medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: If price closes consistently above 50SMA and 50SMA is sloping up, it suggests a bullish intermediate trend; price dipping below could signal a trend pause or pullback.
  - Caveats: Lags price; best used with faster signals for timing.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - What it measures: long-term trend benchmark; macro backdrop.
  - How to use: A price above 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA is a positive multi-month trend setup; a cross below can indicate a longer-term risk-off phase.
  - Caveats: Slow to respond; primarily for trend confirmation rather than entry timing.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  - What it measures: short-term momentum and trend shifts.
  - How to use: Use crossovers with price or with longer-term averages to spot quick momentum changes. If 10EMA crosses above price or above 50SMA, it can be a near-term bullish impulse.
  - Caveats: More sensitive to noise; filter with other signals.
- macd (MACD line)
  - What it measures: momentum via differences of EMAs (fast vs slow).
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossing above/below zero or MACD line crossing the signal (macds) as momentum changes. Divergences with price can warn of reversals.
  - Caveats: Works best in trending markets; confirm with other tools in thin/sideways ranges.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: the signal line (EMA of MACD) for momentum smoothing.
  - How to use: Crossovers of MACD and macds trigger potential entries/exits; combined with price action and slope of moving averages strengthens signals.
  - Caveats: Prone to lag; don’t rely on it alone.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it measures: momentum strength (gap between MACD and its signal).
  - How to use: Increasing histogram bars suggest strengthening momentum in the current direction; shrinking bars can warn of momentum fading.
  - Caveats: Can be volatile in fast moves; use with trend and price signals.
- rsi (RSI)
  - What it measures: short-to-medium momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: Typical thresholds: >70 overbought, <30 oversold. Watch for divergences with price and for RSI moving back from extreme levels as a reversal cue.
  - Caveats: In strong trends RSI can stay in extended zones for long periods; always confirm with trend structure.
- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it measures: market volatility (range-based).
  - How to use: Use ATR to size risk and set adaptive stops; rising ATR indicates expanding volatility, which may accompany breakouts or reversals.
  - Caveats: Reactive rather than predictive; interpret in the context of trend and volume.

How these indicators work together (conceptual framework for AAPL)
- Trend confirmation: If price remains above 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA, the bias is bullish. In that context, use MACD (macd/macds) to confirm ongoing momentum and RSI to ensure momentum isn’t becoming overextended.
- Timing within a trend: Use close_10_ema for early momentum shifts, but confirm with MACD histograms (macdh) and MACD line crossovers (macd/macds) before acting. This helps avoid noise-driven entries.
- Volatility and risk management: Use ATR to adjust stop placement and position sizing as volatility changes; Bollinger-based interpretations can be layered later if needed, but ATR suffices for risk control in this set.
- Reversals and pullbacks: RSI divergences (e.g., price making new highs while RSI fails to, or price new lows with RSI not confirming) paired with MACD histogram weakening can signal a potential reversal or consolidation phase after trend runs.
- Breakouts vs. pullbacks: If price rides above the 50SMA and 200SMA but ATR spikes, consider that higher volatility supports breakouts; confirm with MACD histogram expansion and MACD line position relative to zero.

Next steps (when data tools are back online)
- Retrieve daily price data for AAPL from 2023-10-22 to 2025-10-22 (or the most recent available date).
- Compute the eight indicators listed above.
- I’ll then deliver a detailed, data-backed trend report, including:
  - The current relationship of price to 50SMA and 200SMA (trend direction, cross events).
  - The MACD, MACD signal, and MACD histogram readings (momentum strength and potential crossovers).
  - RSI level and any divergences with price.
  - ATR level and recent volatility changes to help with risk management.
  - A concise set of actionable signals (entry, exit, or hold) based on how these indicators align.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data and indicators now, or would you prefer I proceed with a purely qualitative, rule-based interpretation using last known frames once the tool is available again? If you want, I can also adjust the indicator set (e.g., swap in boll_middle with boll_ub/boll_lb for breakout context) depending on your preferred market scenario (range-bound vs. trending).

Note: Once I regain data access, I’ll return with a detailed, live, data-backed analysis and concrete trade considerations tailored to AAPL on the current date. If you’d like, I can also run a quick alternative using a different data feed or a narrower date window once the tool is functioning again.
