## Trading Scenarios and Outlook
- Base Case (Bullish Continuation)
  - Thesis: iPhone 17 momentum sustains growth; AI-enabled services lift margins; earnings confirm earnings power.
  - Price path: test toward the upper end of the analyst band, targeting around **$315**.
  - Actions: maintain core long exposure with a disciplined trailing stop; consider upside capture via out-of-the-money calls or call spreads.
- Bull Case
  - Thesis: stronger-than-expected earnings and AI monetization accelerate multiple expansion; momentum drives a run toward the mid-to-high **$300s**.
  - Price path: potential move beyond **$315** toward the high end of the range; may approach or exceed the mid- to high-**$300s** if catalysts hit.
  - Actions: gradual scaling into strength; prefer risk-managed exposures (e.g., spreads) to capture extra upside with limited downside.
- Bear Case
  - Thesis: regulatory/regional headwinds intensify (notably China App Store scrutiny) or Q4 guidance disappoints.
  - Price path: near-term pullback; risk of testing the recent swing lows and possible breach of the uptrend.
  - Price anchors (if risk materializes): potential pressure toward the mid-to-lower **$200s–$250s** area on a sharp downgrade in sentiment.
  - Actions: reduce outright exposure on rallies; employ protective puts or hedges to cap downside risk; reassess on earnings clarity and regulatory updates.
