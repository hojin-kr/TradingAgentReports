I’m running into an error fetching the Reddit stock info for NFLX on 2025-10-22: FileNotFoundError (internal data source issue). I can’t retrieve the latest Reddit sentiment feed right now.

Options to proceed:
- A) Retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll attempt again immediately).
- B) Use an alternative data source I can access to gauge sentiment and recent news.
- C) If you prefer, proceed with a qualitative synthesis based on known public signals up to now, noting that it won’t include the latest Reddit feed.

If you want me to retry, say “Retry now.” If you’d like an alternative approach, say “Use alternative sources.” If you’d prefer a qualitative read, say “Proceed qualitatively.”

What I’ll deliver in the next step (once I have data):
- A day-by-day sentiment breakdown for NFLX over the past week.
- The most-discussed topics (e.g., earnings, content slate, subscriber trends, pricing, Ad-Supported tier, regulatory news).
- Summary of any notable news events (new content, partnerships, subscriber numbers, cash flow signals, guidance).
- Implications for traders: potential volatility catalysts, support/resistance levels, risk factors (competition, ad market, macro).
- A concise risk/return outlook and potential trading ideas (short-term catalysts, longer-term stance).
- A Makrdown table at the end organizing key points for quick review.

Tell me how you’d like to proceed.
