I attempted to fetch NFLX data and compute the requested indicators, but the data access layer returned a FileNotFoundError. I’ve retried across a few date ranges and also attempted parallel indicator fetches, but the environment still can’t retrieve the necessary CSV/data right now. I can retry automatically in a moment, or you can provide a CSV/file with NFLX data. In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan and the selected indicators I would use once data is available, plus an actionable interpretation framework for NFLX as of 2025-10-22.

Selected indicators (8 total) and why they’re suitable for NFLX
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Purpose: Establishes the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance.
  - NFLX context: Netflix often exhibits sustained trends around earnings or user-growth milestones. 50-day trend helps filter signals during choppier phases.

- close_10_ema (Moving Averages)
  - Purpose: Captures quick momentum shifts; more sensitive than the 50-SMA.
  - NFLX context: Useful to spot early entries/exits around rapid move days (e.g., post-earnings moves or guidance updates).

- macd (MACD)
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals via MACD line (fast) vs. signal line (slow).
  - NFLX context: Large moves often feature clear MACD momentum changes as sentiment shifts.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Purpose: Smoother confirmation of MACD-derived signals.
  - NFLX context: Reduces false positives by requiring MACD line cross with the signal line to validate a setup.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - Purpose: Visualizes momentum strength and divergence magnitude.
  - NFLX context: Quick read on whether buyers or sellers are gaining the upper hand, especially around news catalysts.

- rsi (RSI)
  - Purpose: Momentum strength with overbought/oversold cues.
  - NFLX context: Useful for spotting extreme conditions around earnings or product-cycle news, and for divergence signals in trend moves.

- boll (Bollinger Middle)
  - Purpose: 20-SMA that underpins Bollinger Bands; baseline for price movement.
  - NFLX context: Helps assess consolidation vs. breakout envelopes and normalize volatility interpretation when combined with band signals.

- atr (ATR)
  - Purpose: Volatility measure to inform risk sizing and stop levels.
  - NFLX context: Netflix can show spikes in volatility around earnings or platform changes; ATR-based stops help adapt to ride height.

How signals could be interpreted for NFLX (high-level framework)
- Trend vs. momentum
  - Price above 50_SMA and above 10_EMA supports a bullish backdrop; look for MACD line cross above signal and rising histogram to confirm renewed momentum.
  - If price is choppy or oscillating near the 50_SMA with MACD printing small histogram bars and RSI hovering near 50, expect range-bound behavior; seek tighter risk controls.

- Momentum confirmation
  - A rising MACD histogram (macdh > 0 and increasing) together with MACD crossing above the signal line strengthens a bullish setup.
  - RSI breaking above 60-70 or failing to reach overbought levels while price trends higher can indicate room for continued upside, but watch for RSI divergence if price makes new highs.

- Volatility and risk management
  - A rising ATR indicates increasing volatility; consider wider stops and position sizing adjustments.
  - If price breaks the Bollinger upper band with expanding ATR, it can signal a strong breakout; if it breaks the lower band during a down move, it may indicate a continuation of downside pressure or a false breakout scenario—confirm with MACD and RSI.

- Consolidation vs. breakout
  - If price sits near Bollinger middle with narrow ATR, expect a potential breakout; monitor macd/histogram for momentum ignition and RSI for pullback risk.

Proposed workflow once data is available
1. Compute the 8 indicators for NFLX across the chosen window (e.g., last 15-30 trading days).
2. Create a signals table:
   - Bullish signals: price above 50_SMA and 10_EMA, macd > signal, macdh positive, RSI rising toward 60-70, price touching/exiting above Bollinger upper band with rising ATR.
   - Bearish signals: price below 50_SMA and 10_EMA, macd < signal, macdh negative, RSI failing to hold above 40-50, price testing Bollinger lower band with rising ATR.
   - Neutral/confirmation: MACD histogram expanding in the direction of price trend; RSI not showing extreme overbought/oversold.
3. Cross-check signals across categories to reduce false positives (e.g., MACD momentum with price trend confirmation and ATR-based risk rating).
4. Produce a concise action overlay:
   - ENTRY: bullish alignment across MACD, RSI, and price above short/medium-term averages with a favorable ATR level.
   - EXIT/REVIEW: if MACD turns down, RSI divergences appear, or price closes back below the 50_SMA with ATR rising.

Next steps
- I can retry data retrieval as soon as the data source is accessible. If you’d like, I can automatically retry every few minutes or you can authorize a retry now.
- Alternatively, you can provide NFLX price data (CSV) for the requested window, and I’ll compute and deliver the full 8-indicator analysis with a detailed trends narrative and a final summarized table.

Note: I did not generate a final trading recommendation (BUY/HOLD/SELL) because we currently lack validated data. Once the data is accessible, I’ll provide a concrete, data-backed assessment with a clear action point if you want me to proceed to a final proposal.

Markdown table: indicators selected and their purposes
| Indicator | Category | Purpose for NFLX | How to interpret (baseline) | Potential trading implications |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50_SMA suggests bullish/bearish trend; cross with price can signal shifts | Use as a trend filter; prefer entries when price is above and pullbacks hold above 50_SMA |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Price crossing above/below 10_EMA indicates quick momentum changes | Consider quicker entries/exits when aligned with MACD/RSI signals |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend-change signals | MACD line crossing above/below the signal line indicates momentum shifts; positive/negative histogram supports trend | Confirm buys/sells when MACD cross aligns with price trend |
| macds | MACD Related | Signal confirmation of MACD-derived moves | Cross of MACD with MACD_Signal strengthens signal validity | Use as a confirmation filter to reduce false positives |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergence | Histogram rising/falling indicates momentum strength; divergences can precede reversals | Use to gauge strength of the move and adjust risk |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold and momentum divergence | RSI >70 overbought, <30 oversold; divergences can foretell reversals | Watch for reversals in trend context; use with trend filters (price/MA) |
| boll | Volatility Indicators | Baseline price movement context | Movement around Bollinger Middle (20_SMA) with band widening/narrowing indicates consolidation vs. breakout | Breakouts above/below bands with momentum signals can signal entries/exits |
| atr | Volatility Indicators | Volatility level for risk management | Rising ATR means higher volatility; consider wider stops and adjusted sizing | Use ATR to set stop-loss distances and adapt position sizing |

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now or in a scheduled follow-up, tell me your preference (e.g., retry in 5 minutes, or retry on demand). I’ll also proceed to deliver a fully populated, data-backed report as soon as NFLX data is accessible.
