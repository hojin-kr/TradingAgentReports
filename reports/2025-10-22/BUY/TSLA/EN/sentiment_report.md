I attempted to fetch TSLA Reddit stock sentiment for 2025-10-22, but the tool returned an internal error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This appears to be a tool-side issue, not a user error.

Here’s how we can move forward:

- Option 1: I retry the Reddit data fetch now. If it succeeds, I’ll proceed with the full sentiment analysis and create the comprehensive report with a finalMarkdown table as requested.
- Option 2: If the retry fails again, I can switch to a fallback approach (e.g., flagging the issue and proceeding with a structured plan, outlining what data we’d collect from Reddit and other sources once access is restored, and preparing the report template for when data comes in).

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you’d like me to retry now, I’ll run another fetch for TSLA on 2025-10-22 immediately and then continue with the deep-dive analysis (social sentiment by day, recent news, and implications for traders), culminating in the Markdown table of key points. Also, would you like me to attempt pulling sentiment from additional sources if available, or strictly Reddit as per the current tool?
