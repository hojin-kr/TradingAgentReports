I attempted to fetch AAPL data for 2024-10-06 to 2025-10-06 but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError (environment issue). I can retry, or we can narrow the date range (e.g., last 6–12 months) or proceed with the indicator framework now and run the data fetch once the tool is available. Below is a detailed indicator framework with a recommended set of 8 indicators and how to use them for AAPL in typical market conditions.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these 8 indicators are chosen
- Trend and dynamic support/resistance: close_50_sma and close_200_sma provide mid- and long-term trend context, helping you identify dominant regime (bullish/bearish/sideways) and potential dynamic support/resistance levels.
- Momentum and signal confirmation: macd, macds, and macdh offer complementary momentum signals. MACD line crossovers (macd with macds) help gauge momentum shifts, while the MACD histogram (macdh) highlights momentum divergence or weakening/strengthening momentum.
- Short-term momentum context: close_10_ema adds a responsive view to capture quick shifts in price action, useful for filtering longer-term signals from the SMAs.
- Momentum strength and reversal risk: RSI (rsi) flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals, especially when used with trend context from the SMAs.
- Volatility and risk framework: ATR (atr) provides a practical read on current volatility, useful for setting stop levels, position sizing, and assessing whether price moves are within expected ranges.

How to interpret these indicators together (framework)
- Trend alignment check:
  - If price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA and 10EMA is above the price or above 50SMA, it suggests a bullish trend with bullish momentum.
  - If price is below both SMAs and 10EMA trends lower, it suggests bearish trend with rising downside momentum.
- Momentum confirmation with MACD family:
  - MACD line crossing above MACD signal (macd above macds) supports a bullish shift; a simultaneous positive MACD histogram (macdh rising) strengthens conviction.
  - MACD crossing below MACD signal and a negative MACD histogram strengthens a bearish setup.
  - Divergence between price and MACD histogram (macdh) can warn of potential exhaustion before a trend change.
- Short-term entry/exit perspective:
  - Monitor price relative to the 10 EMA for quicker shifts; use crossovers with SMAs as confirmation rather than a standalone trigger.
- Reversal risk and overextension:
  - RSI above 70 with bullish trend signals may indicate overbought risk and potential pullback; RSI below 30 with a bearish trend may indicate oversold conditions with possible bounce risk.
- Volatility context for risk management:
  - ATR readings help adjust stop distances; rising ATR implies wider stops and potentially higher risk per trade, while low ATR implies tighter stops and potentially more precise entries.

Operational notes (how to use in practice)
- Look for confluence: prefer trades when trend signals (SMAs) align with MACD momentum and RSI confirms a reasonable momentum stance rather than relying on a single indicator.
- Use ATR for risk controls: set stop-loss levels at a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.5–2x ATR) to adapt to current volatility.
- Volume considerations (optional addition if data is available later): VWMA can help confirm price-market-volume alignment, but since we’re limiting to 8 indicators, the current set emphasizes price and volatility signals rather than volume alone.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching data now or with an adjusted date window (for example, 2025-01-01 to 2025-10-06, or the last 6–12 months) if you’d like.
- If you want me to proceed immediately with the 8-indicator framework above, I can generate a structured interpretation once I have access to the data (the actual values for AAPL data to feed into these indicators). Please confirm if you’d like me to retry fetching now or adjust the date range.

Markdown table: key points at a glance
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret signals | How it helps for AAPL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Mid-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend; below suggests downtrend | Establishes core trend context for AAPL and filters entries |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA indicates long-term bullish regime; below indicates bearish | Confirms regime; helps assess strategic bias (long/short) |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10EMA signals quick momentum shifts | Timely filter for entries in conjunction with longer SMAs |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum via EMAs differences | MACD line crossing above/below signal indicates momentum change; positive/negative values show strength | Signals momentum shifts aligned with trend context |
| macds | MACD Signal | EMA of MACD line | Crossovers with MACD line provide trade triggers | Helps reduce false positives by confirming MACD signals |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence | Rising histogram supports bullish momentum; falling indicates bearish momentum | Early divergence cues and momentum strength checks |
| rsi | Momentum Indicator | Momentum and overbought/oversold levels | RSI >70 overbought, <30 oversold; watch for divergences with price | Identifies potential reversals or pullbacks in prevailing trends |
| atr | Volatility Indicator | Market volatility, range expectations | Higher ATR = wider price ranges and looser stops; lower ATR = tighter ranges | Guides risk management and stop placement, adapts position sizing |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now (potentially with a shorter or different date window) and then produce a detailed, data-driven trend analysis for AAPL using these eight indicators. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.
