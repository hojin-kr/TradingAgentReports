I attempted to fetch AMD data to generate a detailed indicator analysis, but the data fetch encountered a FileNotFoundError in the environment. I can retry fetching the data if you’d like, or proceed with a best-practice indicator framework now and populate it once the data is available. In the meantime, here is a focused, non-redundant set of indicators and why they’re suitable for AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) in a typical mid-to-long trading view.

Selected indicators (up to 8, diversified and complementary)
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-period simple moving average.
  - Why suitable for AMD: Captures the medium-term trend, helps filter noise from short-term moves, and provides dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming whether AMD’s price is in an uptrend or downtrend relative to a widely watched reference.
- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-period simple moving average.
  - Why suitable for AMD: Long-term trend benchmark. Important for identifying major regime shifts (golden/death cross concepts) and aligning strategic bias with macro- or sector-leading moves in semis.
- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: 10-period exponential moving average.
  - Why suitable for AMD: A responsive short-term momentum gauge to catch quick shifts, potential entries, or early pullbacks. Can be noisy in choppy markets, so it’s most effective when paired with the longer SMAs above.
- macd
  - What it measures: Moving Average Convergence-Divergence momentum via EMA differences.
  - Why suitable for AMD: Signals trend changes through MACD line crossovers and divergence with price. Helps identify momentum shifts that may precede larger trend moves.
- macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (the EMA of the MACD line).
  - Why suitable for AMD: Crossovers between MACD and MACDS add a filter to MACD signals, reducing false positives and improving timing for entries/exits.
- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD histogram (difference between MACD and MACDS).
  - Why suitable for AMD: Visualizes momentum strength/weakness and potential divergences earlier than crossovers. Useful for spotting fading momentum or acceleration on price moves.
- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index (momentum oscillator).
  - Why suitable for AMD: Signals overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Divergence between RSI and price can hint at weakening momentum even as prices run, helpful in volatile semis environments.
- atr
  - What it measures: Average True Range (volatility).
  - Why suitable for AMD: Provides a sense of current volatility level, informing stop-loss placement and position sizing. Critical for risk management in a stock known for sizable intraday swings and reaction to demand/supply shifts.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed trend/report that integrates these indicators into a cohesive view of AMD’s current state (as of the requested date, 2025-10-06 or the nearest available data).
- Signals and interpretation guidelines: how SMA crossovers align with MACD, how RSI readings interact with trend context, and how ATR informs risk controls.
- Potential trade ideas or risk-management notes tailored to the AMD profile (semis sector sensitivity, earnings cycle, supply/demand cues).

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now, or you can confirm a different date range you’d like me to pull.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-free framework and fill in the quantitative pieces once the data is retrieved.

Appendix: Key points at a glance (indicator quick-reference)
- Trend: 50_sma, 200_sma
- Short-term momentum: 10_ema, macd, macds, macdh
- Momentum confirmation and risk: RSI
- Volatility/risk management: ATR

Markdown table: Key indicators, their role, and interpretation for AMD
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AMD | Practical signal cues |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend (50 periods) | Price above = uptrend bias; below = downtrend bias; use with longer-term trend for confirmation | Look for price crossing above/below 50SMA with alignment to 200SMA |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend (200 periods) | Price above = bullish macro/trend; below = bearish macro/trend | Golden cross/death cross potential; consider time-frame consistency |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum (fast average) | Quick shifts in momentum; can be noisy | Crosses of price or longer SMAs signal potential entries/exits in the near term |
| macd | MACD momentum (MACD line vs. signal) | Positive/strengthening momentum when MACD above signal; negative/weaker when below | Crossovers and divergence with price to anticipate trend changes |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoother confirmation of MACD signals | MACD crossing MACDS reinforces entry/exit cues; use with MACD for filter |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength, acceleration/deceleration | Increasing histogram suggests strengthening move; shrinking/negative hints reversal or loss of momentum |
| rsi | Relative momentum oscillator | Overbought/oversold zones; divergence signals potential reversals | RSI > 70 = possible overbought; RSI < 30 = possible oversold; watch for price-rsi divergence |
| atr | Volatility magnitude | Higher ATR implies more price movement and larger stop ranges | Use to set wider stops during high-volatility regimes; adapt position sizing |

Note: Data retrieval for AMD did not succeed in this session. If you’d like, I can retry immediately, or you can specify a date range and I’ll proceed as soon as the data feed is available.
