# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD is rated Buy with a staged, risk-managed entry. Upside comes from a diversified AI product mix, real enterprise traction (IBM MI300X), and potential manufacturing-partner diversification. Risks include execution, Nvidia competition, and supply concentration.

## Investment Decision
Buy. Confidence: Medium-High.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Diverse AI exposure: AMD works across general CPUs, graphics chips, and specialized AI accelerators, with the potential for new manufacturing partnerships to share risk.
- Real enterprise traction: IBM’s MI300X deployment shows large-scale AI workloads are happening in the real world, not just talk.
- Roadmap and software maturity: Next-generation processors (Zen 6) and improved software support boost efficiency and enterprise deployment reliability.
- Optionality on manufacturing partners: Possible diversification of manufacturing partners could improve supply confidence and cost dynamics over time.
- Margin and leverage potential: A broad compute stack may enable better revenue growth to lift margins as volumes rise.

## Risks To Watch
- Execution and optionality risk: Diversifying manufacturing is uncertain and may take longer to impact profits.
- Competitive pressure: Nvidia remains a dominant player; AMD’s gains could be modest rather than transformative.
- Supply concentration risk: Heavy reliance on TSMC; geopolitical factors could affect ramp timing.
- Traction risk: Enterprise wins like IBM MI300X can be meaningful but are uneven and not always repeatable.
- Valuation risk: AI demand could soften, putting pressure on margins during ramp periods.
