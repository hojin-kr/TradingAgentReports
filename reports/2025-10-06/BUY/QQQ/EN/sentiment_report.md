Sorry — I hit an internal error when trying to pull Reddit data for QQQ on 2025-10-06. The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry now, or we can switch to a workaround and proceed with a qualitative, framework-based analysis while we wait for the data tool to come back online. Here are two options:

Option A: Retry and run the full data-driven report
- I will re-attempt the Reddit data pull for QQQ on 2025-10-06 and proceed to generate a comprehensive sentiment-focused report (social media, daily sentiment, and public news) with a Markdown table summarizing key points.

Option B: Proceed without live Reddit data (qualitative framework)
- I’ll deliver a structured, trader-focused analysis using a robust framework (social sentiment methodology, headline themes, macro/sector drivers, and trading implications) and a placeholder table that will be filled with actual data once the Reddit tool is working again.

If you’re okay with it, I can proceed with Option B immediately and note where Reddit sentiment would be injected once the data becomes available.

What I propose to include in the report (Option B style, ready to fill in with data when available):
- Executive snapshot
  - Brief read on current sentiment posture (overall mood: bullish/bearish/mixed), and key confidence-/fear-driven drivers for QQQ today.
- Social media sentiment framework
  - Data sources: Reddit, X (Twitter), StockTwits, other crypto/tech forums if available.
  - Daily sentiment cadence: how sentiment shifts intraday vs. daily close, presence of extreme keywords (e.g., "ai", "semis", "rates", "crash", "rally").
  - Thematic drivers: AI buzz, large-cap tech earnings, chip cycles, regulatory/monetary policy tone, macro risk signals.
- News and headlines analysis (last 7 days)
  - Summary of notable headlines affecting tech-heavy indices: earnings, guidance, macro news, policy signals.
  - Net sentiment of headlines (positive/neutral/negative) and how it aligns or diverges from social sentiment.
- Key sentiment signals to watch (for traders)
  - If Reddit/X sentiment is skewed positive but macro risk is rising, discuss potential pullbacks or relief rallies.
  - If fear is rising with weak breadth in tech names, discuss downside risk and hedging signals.
- Price-action and micro-structure cues to watch
  - Volume spikes, options flow (call vs put skew), IV changes around tech earnings windows, sector rotation signals.
- Trader implications and potential scenarios
  - Bullish scenario: sustained positive AI/tech momentum, favorable macro backdrop, and stable rate expectations.
  - Bearish scenario: sentiment breakdown, macro risk intensifies, growth weakness in mega-cap tech.
  - Base case: mixed sentiment with narrow range consolidation and selective leadership names.
- Risk considerations
  - Concentration risk in Nasdaq-100/QQQ, concentration in mega-cap tech, liquidity during macro events, and the impact of policy surprises.
- Data table (Markdown-ready skeleton)
  - A structured table that will be populated with date-by-date sentiment, headlines, sources, and implications.

If you want me to proceed with Option A (full data-driven approach with the Reddit data now), I’ll retry the data pull immediately and then produce the complete long-form report, including a final Markdown table with the key points.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now (Option A) or proceed with the qualitative Option B framework first? If you have a preferred format for the Markdown table (columns you want), tell me and I’ll tailor it.
