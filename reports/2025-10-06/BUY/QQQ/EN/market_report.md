Sorry—I tried to fetch QQQ data with the provided tool, but I hit a backend error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory) on the data retrieval step. I attempted it twice, and it didn’t succeed. I can proceed in a couple of ways: either retry the data fetch now if you want me to keep trying, or we can proceed with a strategy-focused indicator setup based on typical QQQ conditions and clearly label that the insights are contingent on the data being loaded successfully. Below is a detailed, ready-to-use indicator plan you can apply once the data retrieval issue is resolved.

Proposed 8 indicators for QQQ (diverse, complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  - What it captures: medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  - Why it’s relevant for QQQ: Tech-heavy, cyclicality means a reliable mid-term trend is valuable to filter signals
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  - What it captures: long-term trend backdrop and major trend regime
  - Why it’s relevant: Helps confirm whether you’re trading with the longer macro trend or against it
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  - What it captures: short-term price momentum
  - Why it’s relevant: Useful for capturing quick shifts in momentum in a high-volatility sector like tech
- macd: MACD line
  - What it captures: momentum via the difference between two EMAs
  - Why it’s relevant: Helps identify momentum shifts and potential trend changes
- macds: MACD Signal
  - What it captures: EMA-smoothed MACD line
  - Why it’s relevant: Crossovers with MACD provide tradable signals within the broader momentum context
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  - What it captures: momentum strength (distance between MACD and its signal)
  - Why it’s relevant: Divergences and histogram agitation help gauge momentum strength and potential exhaustion
- rsi: RSI
  - What it captures: momentum and overbought/oversold conditions
  - Why it’s relevant: 70/30 thresholds and potential divergences help flag reversals, especially in strong uptrends or downtrends
- atr: ATR
  - What it captures: market volatility (true range average)
  - Why it’s relevant: Useful for sizing risk and setting stop levels in a volatile ETF like QQQ

How to interpret these indicators together (high-level guidance)
- Trend confirmation
  - Price above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA generally signals a bullish backdrop; price below both suggests bearish or mixed conditions. Use crossovers (e.g., price crossing above/below these SMAs) in conjunction with MACD to confirm changes in momentum.
- Momentum and signal timing
  - MACD and its signal line (macd, macds) give you momentum direction and potential crossovers for entries/exits. MACD histogram (macdh) helps gauge momentum strength and potential divergences vs price.
  - RSI adds a momentum-overbought/oversold perspective; use caution when RSI is extreme in a strong trend—trend-following signals can persist even with high RSI.
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR informs position sizing and stop placement. Rising ATR indicates higher volatility, suggesting wider stops; falling ATR suggests tighter risk controls.
- Volume/structure context (optional note)
  - VWMA could be added for confirmation with volume in a separate pass if you want an additional layer; however, we’re keeping to 8 indicators as defined above to avoid redundancy.

What you’ll see once data loads (typical signal interpretations)
- Bullish setup:
  - Price=above 50_SMA and 200_SMA; MACD positive with MACD line above Signal; RSI in 50–70 range leaning higher; ATR increasing mildly
  - Action cue: seek pullbacks toward the 50_SMA or 200_SMA as potential entries, with tight risk management near recent swing lows
- Bearish setup:
  - Price=below 50_SMA and 200_SMA; MACD negative with MACD line below Signal; RSI below 50 and trending down; ATR rising on downside moves
  - Action cue: consider short entries on momentum breaks below recent support, with stops above nearby resistance levels
- Neutral/choppy with signals:
  - Mixed MACD and RSI around midpoints; ATR subdued or fluctuating; price ping-ponging around the SMAs
  - Action cue: prefer wait-and-see signals, or use tighter stops and smaller position sizes

Next steps
- If you want me to proceed now, I can retry the data retrieval and then generate a formal, data-backed analysis using these 8 indicators for QQQ, followed by a detailed trend assessment and a table of key takeaways.
- If you’d prefer not to retry the fetch right away, I can provide a version of the report based on current market context and typical QQQ behavior, clearly flagging that it’s a qualitative framework without the latest data.

Markdown table: Summary of selected indicators and their roles
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret in QQQ context | Practical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above suggests uptrend; below suggests downtrend | Filter entries with trend direction; use as support/resistance anchor |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend backdrop | Price above indicates long-term bullish regime; below indicates bearish | Confirm strategic bias; watch for golden/death cross signals |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; can give early entry/exit cues | Use to time entries in tandem with longer-term trends |
| macd | Momentum (MACD line vs. signal) | Positive MACD with cross above Signal favors up-moves; negative with cross below favors down-moves | Core momentum signal; pair with trend filters |
| macds | MACD signal line (smoothed MACD) | Crosses add clarity to momentum shifts | Helps confirm MACD-based entries/exits |
| macdh | MACD histogram (momentum strength) | Expanding histogram signals strengthening moves; shrinking indicates weakening | Divergence/additional momentum signal |
| rsi | Momentum, overbought/oversold |>=70 overbought, <=30 oversold; beware in strong trends | Divergence checks; validate with trend direction |
| atr | Volatility | Rising ATR signals higher volatility; falling ATR signals lower volatility | Guide risk management and stop placement |

Important note about the data retrieval issue
- The current analysis plan relies on fresh data for QQQ. The data fetch step failed due to a FileNotFoundError. If you’d like, I can:
  - Retry the data fetch now and proceed with a fully data-driven analysis, or
  - Proceed with the qualitative framework above and annotate signals once the data is loaded.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed: retry the data fetch, or move forward with the qualitative framework and indicator setup?
