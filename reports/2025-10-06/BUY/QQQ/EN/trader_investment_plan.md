Decision: Buy with hedged, disciplined exposure to the mega-cap growth engine driving QQQ.

Rationale (aligned with the proposed plan)
- Core thesis remains intact: AI/cloud-driven mega-caps offer durable, high-margin growth with scalable cash flows and resilient balance sheets. Macro tailwinds support long-duration earnings in the near term.
- Concentration risk acknowledged: The plan’s hedging and staged entry mitigate the risk of a single name derailing performance. This keeps you participating in upside while reducing downside susceptibility.
- Risk controls in place: The recommendation explicitly includes hedges around catalysts, defined downside triggers, and rotation rules to manage adverse dispersion among the six megacaps.

Execution plan (practical steps)
1) Core exposure
- Establish or maintain a core long position in QQQ or a mega-cap-focused sleeve (MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN, META) as the primary long exposure.
- Position sizing: deploy in 3–5 tranches over weeks to avoid timing risk and to capture dips, starting with a modest initial commitment and layering in on pullbacks.

2) Entry points
- Favor gradual accumulation on meaningful pullbacks or at technical supports (e.g., near major moving averages or consolidation bases) rather than buying strength.

3) Hedging and risk controls
- Protective hedges: use puts on QQQ or on the top holdings to cap downside without sacrificing upside. Cost-effective options include buying slightly out-of-the-money puts or implementing a collar (long QQQ, long puts, short calls to offset cost).
- Dynamic hedging: increase hedge sizing around earnings windows, AI milestones, or macro event risk; trim once guidance stabilizes and downside risk abates.
- Defined triggers: pre-set thresholds for increasing or decreasing exposure (e.g., if mega-cap guidance deteriorates by a material amount for two consecutive quarters, scale back core exposure or boost hedges).

4) Stock-level discipline and monitoring
- Track the six megacaps: MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN, META. Adjust weights based on guidance, AI monetization progress, and margin trajectories.
- Be ready to trim or hedge any name that experiences a meaningful miss or dis‑appointing guidance.

5) Diversification within growth
- Do not rely on a single instrument. Combine core QQQ exposure with hedged, targeted exposure to the mega-cap leaders to maintain breadth within the growth regime.

6) Data/decision cadence
- Weekly check-ins for exposure sizing, hedge effectiveness, and top-name guidance; monthly reviews of macro backdrop and earnings revisions. Use a data overlay when reliable feeds are available.

7) Time horizon and contingency
- Target horizon: 6–12 months, with extension possible if macro and earnings trajectory remains supportive.
- Contingency: if two of the top six megacaps disappoint for two consecutive quarters, reduce core exposure and consider reallocating to hedged, less-coupled tech exposures to preserve optionality.

Learning or memory note
- There are no prior explicit decision memories to draw from here. The approach applies disciplined risk controls, staged entries, and hedging to balance upside capture with downside protection.

Final thoughts
- The recommended stance is constructive exposure to QQQ via a hedged core long strategy focused on mega-cap leadership, with disciplined entry, ongoing surveillance of leadership signals, and predefined risk-management rules.
