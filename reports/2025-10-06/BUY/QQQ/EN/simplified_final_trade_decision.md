## Executive Summary
Buy QQQ with hedged, disciplined exposure to mega-cap leaders. The AI/cloud growth story and positive macro trends offer upside, while risk controls aim to limit potential losses.

## Investment Decision
Buy, with high confidence. Use hedges and staged entry to manage risk while preserving upside.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- What QQQ is: An easy way to own the biggest, financially strongest U.S. tech and growth stocks.
- Durable growth drivers: Artificial intelligence and cloud services create scalable, recurring revenue and solid profits.
- Strong balance sheets: Large-cap leaders have cash and strength to weather short-term macro bumps.

## Risks To Watch
- Valuation and rate risk: Prices may be high, and higher interest rates could weigh on gains.
- Concentration risk: Heavy reliance on a few mega-cap names means a miss by one can hurt the whole approach.
