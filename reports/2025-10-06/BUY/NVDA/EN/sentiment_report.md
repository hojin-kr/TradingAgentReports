Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock info for NVDA, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal tool issue). I can retry now, or switch to alternative data sources (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, StockTwits, major news outlets, press releases, earnings calls) to keep the analysis moving.

Options:
- Retry Reddit data fetch now and proceed with the full long report once I have that input.
- Proceed with a comprehensive NVDA sentiment/news report using other sources (clearly labeling any gaps due to not having Reddit data).
- Wait for your ok to both retry Reddit and pull from other sources.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, I’ll:
- Compile a detailed NVDA sentiment and news analysis for the past week.
- Break down by day sentiment trends (as available), key drivers, and notable news events (AI demand, supply chain, partnerships, guidance, etc.).
- Assess implications for traders and investors (short-term catalysts, risk factors, and potential scenarios).
- End with a structured Markdown table summarizing key points, drivers, signals, and actionable takeaways.

Please tell me which path you prefer:
1) Retry Reddit data now
2) Proceed with non-Reddit sources (and I’ll clearly note any limitations)
3) Wait and retry later

Also, if you have a preferred emphasis (e.g., more weight on AI demand signals vs. supply chain risk, or a focus on options market vs. equity sentiment), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis.
