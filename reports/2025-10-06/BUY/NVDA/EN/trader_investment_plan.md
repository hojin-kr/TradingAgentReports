Decision: Buy, with a hedged core long in NVDA using a staged entry and disciplined risk controls.

Why this aligns with the plan and current risk-reward
- Core thesis intact: NVDA remains central to the AI infrastructure story through a durable data-center moat, software ecosystem, and high-margin software-enabled revenue, supporting growth visibility and cash flow expansion.
- Manageable risk with hedges: Given elevated valuation and macro/regulatory headwinds, pairing a core long with hedges helps preserve upside while limiting downside.
- Staged entry reduces timing risk: Splitting into two tranches captures upside if the thesis accelerates and protects on pullbacks or choppier tape.
- Risk controls are explicit: ATR-based stops, systematic reallocation rules after earnings or catalyst events, and a formal contingency plan.

Position sizing and entry plan
- Target core exposure: 2–4% of the total portfolio as a starting point (adjust up to 5–6% only if you have higher risk tolerance and robust hedges in place).
- Staged entry:
  - Stage 1: Buy 50% of the planned position today if the stock trades above the 200-day moving average with positive momentum signals (MACD bullish, RSI trending up).
  - Stage 2: Buy the remaining 50% after a defined confirmation, such as: breakout above a recent swing high on strong volume or a controlled pullback to a support zone with constructive indicators.
- Entry triggers alternatives: If price consolidates, consider a measured entry on a breakout above a defined resistance band tied to AI catalysts or a clear breakout above a recent swing high on higher-than-average volume.

Risk controls and hedging
- Stops:
  - Use ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.0–2.0x ATR) adaptable to current volatility.
  - Reassess and tighten/adjust after major earnings or AI catalyst events.
  - If price closes below the 200-day MA and cannot reclaim it with positive MACD/RSI signals, trim exposure or hedge.
- Hedging strategies:
  - Collar: Long NVDA, buy a long-dated put (6–12 months) near or slightly below entry price, funded by selling a short-dated out-of-the-money call to reduce net cost.
  - Alternative: Protective long-dated puts with a smaller or no call sale, or a vertical call spread to cap upside in exchange for reduced premium outlay.
- Position protection: Maintain flexibility to reduce or hedge quickly if data-center demand slows, margins compress, or regulatory/geopolitical risk intensifies.

Profit-taking and risk-rebalancing
- Trailing approach: Implement a disciplined trailing stop (percentage-based or ATR-adjusted) to lock in gains while allowing upside participation.
- Take-profit bands: Consider staged exits at predefined levels (e.g., partial trim near 1.5x initial risk, another trim near 2x) and reassess at major AI catalysts (new data-center wins, software/margin milestones).
- Rebalance cadence: Revisit the thesis quarterly and after key earnings or AI catalyst announcements; adjust hedges or exposure accordingly rather than waiting for macro shocks.

Monitoring and review cadence
- Key data to watch:
  - Hyperscaler capex momentum, backlog visibility, and AI workload growth signals.
  - Margin trajectory: changes in hardware vs. software mix, and software-enabled revenue contributions.
  - Regulatory/geopolitical developments that could impact supply chains or cross-border sales.
  - Insider activity and major customer announcements as supplementary context.
- Review cadence: Quarterly thesis review, with interim checks after earnings or material AI announcements.

Contingency planning
- If growth expectations slow or guidance disappoints: Reduce exposure quickly, consider reweighting toward hedged positions or a diversified AI infra basket to manage idiosyncratic risk.
- If macro risk intensifies or market regime shifts to risk-off: Lean into hedged exposure, potentially trim further, and preserve downside optionality for a later re-accumulation.

Operational notes
- Portfolio sizing should reflect your total risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and the availability of hedging instruments.
- If you’d like, I can tailor exact price levels for entry, stops, and targets to your specific portfolio size, risk appetite, and time horizon.
