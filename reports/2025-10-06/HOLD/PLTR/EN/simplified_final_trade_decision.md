# Investment Report: PLTR
## Executive Summary
Palantir provides data analytics software for government and enterprise clients. Near-term data is unclear and headlines can move the stock. Hold is prudent until credible multi-quarter progress is shown.

## Investment Decision
Hold (Confidence: Medium)

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Data and transparency gaps: backlog, margins, and cash flow are not clearly improving yet.
- Revenue mix risk: heavy government exposure creates policy and cadence risk; commercial ARR growth could improve margins if it materializes.
- Profitability timeline uncertain: high research and selling costs may keep GAAP profits and free cash flow unclear near term.
- Price volatility: the stock can swing with headlines; longer-term upside exists but requires durable progress.
- Optionality remains: meaningful upside requires credible, multi-quarter progress in profitability levers.

## Risks To Watch
- Government program cadence and policy changes can alter growth.
- Data visibility gaps: backlog clarity, revenue mix, margins, and cash flow stability.
- Near-term profitability risk due to high R&D and SG&A costs.
- Competition pressure on pricing and deployment speed.
- Security-related headlines or program exposure could move the stock.
- Concentration risk: reliance on DoD/UK MoD contracts; international exposure and currency effects.
