I attempted to fetch NFLX data with get_YFin_data but hit a tool error (FileNotFoundError) for both date ranges I tried. It looks like the data source or path is temporarily unavailable on my end. I can retry data retrieval as soon as the data backend is accessible, or you can specify a different date window and I’ll try again. In the meantime, here’s a focused plan with a carefully chosen set of indicators and how I would interpret them for NFLX given typical growth/tech stock dynamics.

Selected indicators (8), chosen for complementary insights and minimal redundancy
- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum via a fast exponential moving average.
  - Why NFLX: Captures quick shifts in momentum around earnings events, subscriber news, or guidance.
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why NFLX: Helps identify the prevailing trend direction and trade-friendly baselines beyond noise.
- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation and potential golden/death cross context.
  - Why NFLX: Provides strategic, multi-quarter context useful for positioning around major upside/downswing regimes.
- macd
  - What it measures: Momentum via differences of EMAs; crossovers signal trend changes.
  - Why NFLX: Good for spotting regime shifts (bullish/bearish) in a stock sensitive to subscriber growth and earnings surprises.
- macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA of MACD); crossovers with MACD help trigger signals.
  - Why NFLX: Helps filter MACD cross signals to reduce false entries in choppy periods.
- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence visualization.
  - Why NFLX: Divergence with price can foreshadow weakening or accelerating moves ahead of catalysts.
- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative momentum; overbought/oversold context.
  - Why NFLX: Useful for spotting potential reversals when paired with trend direction; keep in mind strong trends RSI can stay extended.
- atr
  - What it measures: Average true range; volatility level.
  - Why NFLX: Guides risk management (position sizing, stop placement) when volatility shifts around earnings or platform news.

Rationale and context for NFLX
- NFLX tends to react strongly to earnings, subscriber growth metrics, and competitive dynamics in streaming. A mix of trend filters (50/200 SMA), a responsive momentum signal (10 EMA plus MACD family), and volatility awareness (ATR) provides a well-rounded view that balances timing, trend direction, and risk.
- Using MACD trio (macd, macds, macdh) alongside RSIs gives a multi-angle view of momentum: direction, confirmation, and strength, which is valuable when evaluating post-earnings moves or guidance revisions.
- ATR helps in sizing positions and setting stops during periods of elevated volatility (e.g., post-earnings days or major content announcements).

How signals would be interpreted (general guidance, once data is available)
- Upward scenario: Price above 50 and 200 SMA, 10 EMA above price or crossing upward, MACD line crossing above signal with positive histogram, RSI rising but not overbought, ATR shows higher but manageable volatility.
- Downward scenario: Price below 50/200 SMA with 10 EMA sloping down, MACD negative and crossing below, RSI in a weakened zone or diverging lower, ATR indicating rising volatility with potential downside breakouts.
- Range-bound scenario: Price oscillates around mid-range of SMAs, MACD relatively flat, RSI alternating but not strongly overbought/oversold, ATR relatively stable; trading signals would rely more on price action near SMA bands and Bollinger-like thinking (though Bollinger bands aren’t in the chosen set here).

Next steps
- I can re-run get_YFin_data as soon as the data source issue is resolved. If you’d like, I can retry with:
  - A narrower range (e.g., last 6–12 months) to improve chances of success.
  - A specific window around known catalysts (e.g., earnings dates you care about).
- If you prefer, specify a new date range and I’ll fetch and compute the indicators, then produce a detailed, trend-focused report with actionable takeaways.

Appendix: concise table of indicators and their roles
| Indicator | What it measures | How it helps with NFLX context | Typical signal interpretation (in brief) |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Captures quick shifts around catalysts | Price/ema cross upward = bullish; cross downward = bearish (watch for whipsaw in choppy markets) |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Core trend direction, dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50 SMA = uptrend bias; below = downtrend bias; cross with price as dynamic signal |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Strategic trend confirmation | Price above 200 SMA = bullish long-term; below = bearish long-term; look for cross with 50 SMA for timing |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Core momentum regime signals | MACD line above signal = bullish momentum; below = bearish; crossovers near zero matter; confirm with other signals |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoother filter for MACD entries | MACD crossing above/below its signal confirms entry/exit timing, less noise than price alone |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Strength of momentum; divergence cues | Expanding histogram = strengthening move; contracting/negative = weakening; divergence with price is notable |
| rsi | Momentum overbought/oversold | Reversal risk context, especially near extremes | RSI >70 overbought or <30 oversold; watch for divergences against price and trend direction |
| atr | Volatility level | Risk management and position sizing | Rising ATR implies higher volatility; use to adjust stops and risk per trade/position |

If you want, I can proceed as soon as the data fetch succeeds, or you can authorize a new date window and I’ll run the same plan immediately.
