I ran into a snag pulling the data you asked for: all tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError (“No such file or directory”). That means I can’t fetch the insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financial statements for TSLA right now.

What I can do next
- Retry fetching all data as soon as the data source/service is back online.
- If you’d like, I can:
  - Attempt the calls one by one (instead of in parallel) to isolate which endpoint is failing.
  - Proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis based on publicly known information up to my last update, clearly labeling it as not current for the past week.
  - Accept data you provide (e.g., paste the latest quarterly numbers) and build a detailed report around them.

Proposed plan for the comprehensive report (once data can be fetched)
- Company profile
  - Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): business segments (Automotive, Energy generation/storage, Services), geographic footprint, product lines (Model S/X/3/Y, Semi, Cybertruck, energy storage and solar), competitive positioning, and recent strategic initiatives.
- Recent corporate context (past week)
  - Key headlines, product updates, regulatory actions, or strategic partnerships.
- Income statement (quarterly)
  - Revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income, operating margin, net income, earnings per share.
- Balance sheet (quarterly)
  - Key items: cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable/payable, inventories, debt (short/long term), shareholders’ equity, book value per share.
- Cash flow statement (quarterly)
  - Operating cash flow, capital expenditures, free cash flow, financing activities.
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Net sentiment score, notable insider buys/sells, any unusual activity vs. historical norms.
- Financial history and trends
  - Margin progression, profitability metrics, liquidity/solvency metrics, leverage, capex intensity, working capital changes.
- Key ratios and screen
  - ROA, ROE, gross/operating/net margins, FCF yield, debt-to-equity, current ratio.
- Risk factors and qualitative takeaways for traders
  - Sensitivities to demand, supply chain, pricing, regulation; potential catalysts or risks over the next 1–4 weeks.
- Trader-oriented insights
  - What to watch in the near term, potential mispricings, and how insider activity might influence sentiment.

Markdown table (structure you’ll get at the end)
- A concise table listing key data points such as Revenue, Net Income, Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Cash & Equivalents, Total Debt, Free Cash Flow, Insider Sentiment, Insider Purchases/Sales, and any notable one-off items, plus a quick interpretation column.

Request
- Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, either by:
  - Re-running all tools in parallel, or
  - Running them sequentially to identify a failing endpoint, or
  - Proceeding with a best-effort qualitative Tesla fundamentals summary using publicly known information (clearly labeled as not current data for the past week)?
- If you have any preferred data window (e.g., last quarterly results, trailing twelve months, or a specific week), tell me and I’ll align the report to it.

Note: If you want, I can also switch gears to a different company or accept data you provide to fill the report.
