I attempted to fetch TSLA data and run the requested indicator analyses, but the data retrieval tools are currently returning a FileNotFoundError. Specifically, TSLA data for 2025-04-01 to 2025-10-06 and the associated indicator reports could not be generated due to an internal file access issue. I can retry fetching the data now or on a set schedule, or proceed with a qualitative, framework-based analysis using the requested indicators once data is available. In the meantime, here is a detailed plan and rationale for TSLA analysis using a complementary 8-indicator set you can expect once data is accessible.

Selected indicators (8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helpful to identify mid-term trend alignment with price.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark and useful for golden/death cross context. Strong confirmation tool for strategic orientation.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Responsive short-term momentum and potential quick entry/exit reference. Prone to noise in choppy markets; best used with longer-term filters.
- macd: MACD line (momentum). Signals trend changes via crossovers and divergence with price.
- macds: MACD Signal (the MACD’s EMA). Crossovers with MACD line help trigger entries/exits with smoother signals.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength gauge; helps spot early changes when used with MACD/momentum context.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions; watch for divergences and threshold crossings (e.g., 30/70).
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility; guides position sizing and stop placement, especially for a high-volatility name like TSLA.

Why these indicators are well-suited for TSLA
- TSLA tends to exhibit pronounced trend shifts and sizable swings. A combination of trend (50/200 SMA), momentum (MACD trio and RSI), and volatility (ATR) provides a robust, non-redundant picture.
- The three MACD-related indicators give a clearer sense of momentum changes (MACD line vs signal) and strength (histogram) than using a single MACD metric.
- RSI complements MACD by showing momentum extremes and potential divergences, which can precede reversals when used with trend direction.
- ATR helps manage risk in a volatile stock by adjusting stop levels and position sizing to current volatility.

How I would interpret TSLA once data is available (framework, not results)
- Trend context
  - Price above 200SMA with 50SMA rising and price above 50SMA suggests a bullish longer-term trend; look for pullbacks to the 50SMA as potential support zones.
  - Price below 200SMA or 50SMA flattening/rolling over signals a risk-off or consolidation phase; require stronger momentum confirmations before taking new long positions.
- Momentum confirmations
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal with a positive or growing MACD histogram supports bullish entries; a cross below with negative histogram supports bearish entries.
  - RSI rising through midline (e.g., above 50) in conjunction with MACD bullish signals strengthens the case for longs; RSI failing above 50 or showing bearish divergence can warn of a pullback.
- Entry/exit points
  - Favor entries when price is aligned with the long-term trend (above 200SMA) and MACD/momentum signals align with that direction, while RSI confirms strength.
  - Use ATR to set initial stop-loss distances (e.g., a multiple of current ATR from entry) and adjust as volatility evolves.
- Risk management and position sizing
  - In periods of high ATR, widen stops proportionally and reduce position size to maintain risk per trade.
  - In low-volatility regimes (lower ATR), tighter stops and possibly smaller position adjustments can be considered, always in line with overall risk limits.
- Reversal/exit considerations
  - MACD bearish cross or histogram turning negative, combined with RSI failing to sustain above 50 or moving toward overbought territory with deteriorating price action, can be a signal to trim or exit.
  - Price breaking below key levels indicated by 50SMA or 200SMA (especially with accompanying MACD/rsi signals) can be a cue to reassess or reduce exposure.

Next steps and options
- Option A (preferred): I retry fetching TSLA data and the 8 indicators now and will provide a data-driven, detailed report with observations, trend analysis, and a concise set of actionable takeaways for TSLA.
- Option B: If you’d like a qualitative, framework-only analysis immediately (no data-driven numbers), I can deliver a TSLA-oriented interpretation using the above indicators and hypothetical signal combinations, then plug in real data as soon as it becomes available.

Please let me know:
- Should I retry the data fetch now and provide the full, data-backed report as soon as the data is retrieved?
- Or would you prefer I proceed with the framework-based qualitative analysis right away, and then update with actual readings once the data tools succeed?

Markdown table: Key points at a glance (pending data)
| Indicator | Role | What to look for in TSLA | Practical implication if signals align |
|----------|------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Trend/Support | Price above/below 50SMA; slope direction | Confirms mid-term trend; use pullbacks to 50SMA as potential entries/ reversals aid |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Price above/below 200SMA; cross with 50SMA | Golden cross/Death cross context; strategic bias confirmation |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10EMA; close to price | Timely entry/exit hints; governs micro-trend shifts |
| macd | Momentum | MACD line vs MACD signal; histogram shape | Trend-change signals; corroborate with price action and RSI |
| macds | Momentum filter | MACD signal line behavior; crossovers | Smoother triggers for entries/exits; reduces false signals |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion/contraction | Early momentum strength/weakness clues; supports timing |
| rsi | Momentum/overbought-oversold | RSI crossing 50; divergence patterns | Signals strength/overextension; aids risk management when combined with trend |
| atr | Volatility | Current ATR level; changes in ATR | Set stops and sizing; adjust for volatility regime |

Notes
- The above framework assumes data access succeeds. I’m ready to fetch TSLA data and deliver a fully data-backed, nuanced report as soon as the tool issue is resolved. If you want me to retry now, I’ll run the fetch and indicator suite again and summarize the exact numbers, trends, and potential trades.
