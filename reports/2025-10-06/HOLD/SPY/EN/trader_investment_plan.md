Decision: Hold SPY with hedges.

Rationale
- The provided plan intentionally hedges near-term uncertainty (data reliability, breadth concentration, regime risk) while preserving upside optionality. A Hold with protective hedges aligns with this framework.
- Multi-indicator convergence remains the key: only when price action, momentum, and breadth confirm should we meaningfully increase long exposure. Until such confirmatory signals appear, stepping up risk is not warranted.
- The hedging approach keeps capital protected against volatility spikes tied to data or policy surprises, while allowing participation if confirmatory signals emerge.

Recommended actions (short, actionable)
- Core exposure: Maintain SPY exposure at a restrained level (roughly 60–70% of total targeted equity exposure) to preserve liquidity and optionality.
- Hedge: Keep a protective hedge in place (e.g., SPY puts or a small put spread) to cap downside without fully sacrificing upside.
- Triggers to adjust:
  - Buy/tilt toward more long exposure if SPY clears above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages with a positive, rising MACD, RSI in the 50s–60s range, and improving breadth on volume.
  - Hedge/deflate risk if SPY closes below the 50-day SMA with negative MACD, RSI weakening toward 40s with bearish divergence, deteriorating breadth, or rising downside ATR.
- Review cadence: Weekly check-in on trend/momentum/breadth signals; adjust hedges and exposure only when you see sustained multi-indicator confirmation.
- Data-availability contingency: If data tools remain unavailable, maintain the hedged-core posture and avoid aggressive new long additions.

Notes on adaptability
- If breadth broadens and leadership shifts beyond mega-caps with constructive macro prints, consider a gradual rotation toward a more diversified long tilt or selective sector exposure to reduce single-name risk.
- If downside risks intensify or data reliability worsens, increase hedging or shift toward cash-equivalents to preserve capital.
