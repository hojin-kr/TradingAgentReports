I ran into a tool issue pulling the data for GOOGL. All requested endpoints returned a FileNotFoundError, so I couldn’t fetch insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financial statements this time.

What I attempted to do just now
- Requested: 
  - Finnhub insider sentiment (past 15 days)
  - Finnhub insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - SimFin balance sheet (quarterly)
  - SimFin cash flow (quarterly)
  - SimFin income statement (quarterly)
- Current date for reference: 2025-10-06
- Result: All calls failed with FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory

Options to proceed
- Option 1: Retry now
  - I can attempt the data fetch again immediately in case the issue is transient or the environment recovers. If it fails again, I’ll document the exact error and propose next steps.

- Option 2: Proceed with a qualitative fundamental report
  - I can produce a thorough fundamental overview of Alphabet (GOOGL) based on publicly available information up to the latest filings, noting that I won’t have the latest insider sentiment/transactions or the exact quarterly figures from SimFin unless the tools become available. This would include:
    - Company profile and business segments
    - Revenue drivers and profitability framework
    - Cash flow and balance sheet quality (high-level)
    - Growth catalysts and risks
    - Competitive landscape and regulatory considerations
    - Insider activity and sentiment (qualitative summary if data becomes available later)
  - I’ll still structure the output with a detailed narrative and a Markdown table at the end to summarize key points.

Please tell me which option you’d like:
- Retry data fetch now (I’ll attempt again and report back the results);
- Proceed with a qualitative fundamental report (I’ll generate a comprehensive analysis now, clearly indicating where data is not pulled from the tools).

If you want me to proceed with the qualitative route, I can start immediately and deliver a detailed report with a final Markdown table of key takeaways.
