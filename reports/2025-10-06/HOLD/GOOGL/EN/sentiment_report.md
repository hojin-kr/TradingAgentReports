I’m running into a tool error fetching Reddit stock news for GOOGL on 2025-10-06:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

This looks like a backend data path for the Reddit feed is missing. I can proceed in a few ways:

- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now or after a short interval to see if the backend issue is resolved.
- Option B: Proceed with a comprehensive analysis using other sources (public news, sentiment from other platforms, etc.) and provide a robust long-form report while we wait for Reddit data to come back.
- Option C: I draft the full report structure now (without Reddit-specific data) and fill in Reddit insights as soon as the tool is available again.

If you’d like me to continue right away, I recommend Option B or C so we don’t stall the analysis. I can still deliver a detailed, trader-focused long report using available sources and a clear plan for incorporating Reddit data once the tool is operational.

What would you prefer?
- Proceed with Option B (pull from other sources now)
- Proceed with Option C (draft the structure now, fill Reddit later)
- Retry Reddit fetch now (and I’ll report back as soon as it returns)
