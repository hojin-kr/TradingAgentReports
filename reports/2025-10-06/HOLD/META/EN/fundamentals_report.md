Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch META’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow for 2025-10-06, but the data retrieval failed with a FileNotFoundError from the data service. It looks like a temporary issue with the data backend.

What I can do next
- Retry data retrieval right away to see if the services come back online and return the latest information.
- Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals report using the most recently confirmed data I can access, clearly noting that the latest 15-day insider sentiment/transactions data may be missing until the data feed is restored.
- Or wait for you to choose a specific approach.

If you’d like me to retry now, I’ll run the data fetch again and then deliver a full, detailed fundamentals report including:
- Company profile and business model
- Revenue streams, margins, and growth drivers
- Balance sheet snapshot (debt, cash, equity, liquidity)
- Income statement highlights (revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income)
- Cash flow overview (operating, investing, financing)
- Recent insider sentiment (past 15 days) and insider transactions (past 15 days) with interpretation
- Key risk factors and catalysts relevant to traders
- Fine-grained, trader-oriented insights (e.g., how recent insider activity or balance sheet changes could affect risk-reward)
- A Markdown summary table at the end organizing the key points for quick reference

If you’d prefer not to wait, I can provide a thorough qualitative analysis based on META’s general fundamentals and recent public information up to the last confirmed period, with explicit notes where data is unavailable, and suggest what to look for once the data feed is restored.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry data retrieval now
- Proceed with a qualitative fundamentals write-up (no latest insider data)
- Wait and retry after a set time (e.g., in 15 minutes)

A quick note: even without the latest insider data, META’s fundamental picture (business model, revenue drivers, capital structure, and cash generation) can still be analyzed to form a trader-oriented view, with the caveat that insider activity insights will be missing until the data service is back.
