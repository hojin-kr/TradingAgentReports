# Investment Report: META
## Executive Summary
META aims to monetize AI across its platforms with data-center investments. Near-term ROI and regulatory costs create margin risk, so hold with staged exposure until durable monetization progress is shown.

## Investment Decision
- Hold META. Confidence level: Medium.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- The long-term AI monetization thesis remains credible: scalable compute and new non-advertising products could boost profits over time.
- Near-term ROI on large capital expenditures is uncertain; margins may tighten if ad demand weakens or regulatory costs rise.
- Regulatory risks are real and could affect costs and monetization, tempering near-term upside.
- Upgrades to a full Buy require multi-quarter proof of durable monetization progress, not a single catalyst.
- The core AI strategy may drive growth later, but near-term clarity and ROI proof are needed.

## Risks To Watch
- Ad-market weakness or slower macro ad cycles could weigh on near-term revenue.
- Regulatory costs and potential new rules in key regions could compress margins.
- Execution risk in expanding non-ads monetization and reliance on AI-enabled monetization.
- Large capex commitments create ROI payback risk if monetization ramps are slower than expected.
- Data privacy and signal changes could affect targeting and monetization efficiency.
