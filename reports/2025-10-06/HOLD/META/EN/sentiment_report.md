Thanks — I attempted to fetch META Reddit sentiment data for the requested dates, but the tool call failed.

What happened
- Tried to fetch Reddit stock sentiment for META for 2025-10-06, 2025-10-05, 2025-10-04, 2025-10-03, 2025-10-02, 2025-10-01, and 2025-09-30.
- The get_reddit_stock_info tool returned FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) for all dates. This looks like an environment/tool issue rather than data unavailability.

What this means for your analysis
- I can’t produce the day-by-day Reddit sentiment breakdown or a sentiment heatmap for the past week without a functioning data source.
- I can still proceed in two ways: retry the Reddit tool, or switch to alternative data sources (e.g., other social platforms and news) to build a comprehensive view.

Next steps (your call)
- Option A: I retry the Reddit tool now to pull META sentiment data for the exact dates requested. If the tool is still unavailable, I’ll switch to alternative sources.
- Option B: I proceed with a broader sentiment and news synthesis using other accessible sources (e.g., mainstream news coverage, general social sentiment on X/Twitter, StockTwits, or Reddit summaries from other aggregators) and provide a robust long-form report with trader-focused insights.
- Option C: You provide OK to proceed with a qualitative snapshot based on recent public news and typical sentiment drivers for META (AI monetization, ad demand, regulatory environment, competition), clearly marked as qualitative until we can fetch exact sentiment figures.

What I’ll deliver in the final long report (if you choose to proceed with data gathering)
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment tone, key catalysts, and any notable divergences between sentiment and price action.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: day-by-day sentiment scores, top themes, and notable posts or threads driving the mood.
- News synthesis: a summary of META-related news from the past week (earnings context, product/AI updates, regulatory/regulatory-tech developments).
- Thematic analysis: recurring topics (AI monetization, ad market trends, user engagement, privacy/regulatory concerns, Metaverse pivot) and how they align with price action.
- Trader implications: risk flags, potential catalysts, and scenario-based guidance (bullish/bearish/neutral cases with likely timelines).
- Quantitative cues: if sentiment data is available, correlate with intraday/close price moves, volume spikes, and volatility shifts.
- Key takeaways and watchlist ideas.

Proposed Markdown table to append at the end of the report
- I’ll populate this fully once data is in. Here is the table structure I’ll use:

| Date | Sentiment (avg) | Top themes observed | News highlights | Trader implications |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 2025-10-06 | | | | |
| 2025-10-05 | | | | |
| 2025-10-04 | | | | |
| 2025-10-03 | | | | |
| 2025-10-02 | | | | |
| 2025-10-01 | | | | |
| 2025-09-30 | | | | |

Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry the Reddit data pull now (I’ll attempt again immediately and report back).
- Proceed with Option B (alternative sources) and deliver a comprehensive sentiment/news report with trader-focused insights.
- Proceed with Option C (qualitative snapshot) while we wait for data retrieval.

Once you pick, I’ll move forward and deliver the full long-form report.
