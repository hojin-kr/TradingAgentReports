Decision: Hold META

Rationale
- Near-term uncertainty remains tangible: ROI on the large AI/capex program, potential regulatory costs, and ad-cycle volatility could pressure margins in the short to medium term.
- Long-term thesis is plausible but not yet proven in the near term: AI-enabled monetization could lift ARPU and take-rates, but requires sustained execution and favorable regulatory evolution.
- The provided plan's logic is sound: hold with risk controls, and upgrade to Buy only on clear, demonstrable progress in monetization metrics and regulatory stability. The current pricing embeds optimism; the risk-reward favors patience until tangible ROI and margin improvement materialize.

Key trade-offs and triggers
- Upgrade to Buy if, for 2 consecutive quarters, you see:
  - Sustained ARPU uplift driven by AI-enabled targeting and non-ads monetization (Business AI for SMBs, creator ecosystem, cross-platform features) with improving gross margins.
  - Evidence that CoreWeave/NVIDIA compute spend translates into better unit economics (higher take-rates, favorable payback).
  - Regulatory outcomes stabilizing or improving, with lower incremental compliance costs.
- Trim or reassess if:
  - ROI on AI capex under-delivers over a multi-quarter window.
  - Operating costs rise or margins compress beyond plan due to headwinds from regulation or ad-market weakness.
  - AI rollout delays or uptake lags meaningfully, depressing ad and non-ad monetization velocity.

Strategic actions (concise)
- Exposure: maintain a disciplined, modest allocation (1–2% starter tranche for new entrants; scale into the thesis only on confirmed progress).
- Risk controls: use staged entries, a clear stop framework (e.g., 8–12% from entry per tranche), and hedging around major catalysts.
- Monitoring: quarterly reviews focused on ARPU, take-rate, gross margin, capex intensity, and ROI payback. Use these as the primary KPIs to decide whether to hold, add, or trim.
- Decision cadence: rely on data-driven milestones rather than headlines. If ROI and monetization improvements are tangible within the next two quarters, consider stepping toward Buy. If not, trim exposure or reallocate.

Lessons applied
- Avoid chasing hype; rely on measurable ROI and monetization progress.
- Treat regulatory risk as a live input; adapt exposure based on evolving costs and rulings.
- Use hedges and staged exposure to stay in the game while awaiting clarity on ROI trajectory.
