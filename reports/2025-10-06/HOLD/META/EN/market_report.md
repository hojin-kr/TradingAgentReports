Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch META data with the available Yahoo Finance data tool, but the data retrieval failed due to a backend FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data fetch now, or proceed with a structured indicator plan that we will apply as soon as the data is available. Please tell me which you prefer:
- Retry fetching META data now
- Proceed with the 8-indicator plan and provide the interpretation once data is accessible

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of indicators I would use for META to give complementary insights (max 8). These selections aim to cover trend, momentum, volatility, and volume considerations without redundant overlap.

Why these 8 indicators are suitable for META
- close_10_ema: Captures quick momentum shifts and potential entry points; useful for tech stocks with rapid developments.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level; helps confirm the near-term trend.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; essential for confirming overall market regime and to watch for golden/death cross implications.
- macd: Momentum and trend-change signals; crossovers or divergences help identify potential shifts in conviction.
- macds: The MACD signal line; its crossovers with MACD provide clearer entry/exit validation when combined with MACD.
- macdh: MACD histogram; shows momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than crossovers.
- rsi: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold signals; useful for spotting reversals when aligned with trend.
- atr: Volatility measure; informs risk management, stop placement, and position sizing in line with current price movement.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch immediately and then generate a full, nuanced report with:
  - Data-driven trend assessment (short/medium/long-term)
  - Momentum analysis (MACD family and RSI)
  - Volatility and risk management (ATR and related signals)
  - A cohesive interpretation that guides potential entries/exits or risk controls
- If you prefer a provisional analysis right now, I can proceed with the 8 indicators above, once data is available, and deliver a detailed trend/signal report plus a concise action plan.

Markdown table: key indicators, category, and rationale (for META)

| Indicator | Category | Rationale for META context |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------|
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Captures rapid momentum shifts; useful for identifying near-term entry/exit points in a high-activity tech stock. |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Provides mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps filter short-term noise when used with other signals. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark; essential for assessing regime and spotting major trend confirmations or reversals. |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and potential trend-change signals; helpful when confirming with other indicators in a volatile tech context. |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD add reliability to momentum-based entries/exits. |
| macdh | MACD Related | Histogram; illustrates momentum strength and potential divergences ahead of MACD crossovers. |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold cues; useful for spotting reversals when aligned with trend direction. |
| atr | Volatility | Volatility-based risk management: informs stop placement and position sizing under changing price ranges. |

If you’d like me to retry the data fetch now, say “Retry,” and I’ll run META again and then deliver the fully data-driven, detailed trend report with the eight indicators above. If you prefer a provisional plan without waiting, I can proceed with the indicators and provide a structured interpretation as soon as data becomes available.
