I attempted to fetch SPY data and run the requested indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t access current SPY values right now. If you’d like, I can retry the data pull, or proceed with a detailed qualitative setup using the chosen indicators and explain how to interpret them once the data is available. Below is a carefully chosen 8-indicator set with rationale and a plan for interpretation.

Selected indicators (8 total, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- boll_ub
- vwma

Why these are suitable for SPY
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Provide a clear sense of medium- to long-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. SPY, as a broad-market proxy, benefits from monitoring both a mid-term (50) and a long-term (200) baseline to distinguish tradable regimes from secular moves.
- macd and macds: Combine momentum and trend-change signals. MACD crossovers (macd vs macds) help identify shifts in momentum that can precede price breaks, especially useful in a market with episodic volatility.
- rsi: Measures momentum with overbought/oversold context. Useful for spotting potential reversals or divergences when price is extending in one direction, especially when paired with trend context from the moving averages.
- boll and boll_ub: Bollinger Middle (20-SMA) provides a volatility-adjusted benchmark; Bollinger Upper adds a signal element for potential overbought zones or breakouts. Together they help gauge squeeze/breakout dynamics and price interaction with volatility bands.
- vwma: Volume-weighted view helps confirm price moves with volume, improving signal quality in a market where participation matters. This is particularly valuable for SPY where large-volume days can drive or validate moves.

What to look for once data is available
- Trend confirmation: If price stays above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA and 50_SMA is above 200_SMA, the near-term trend is bullish. Conversely, price below both with a 50/200 cross (death cross) signals bearish tilt.
- MACD signals: A bullish crossover (macd crossing above macds) in an uptrend adds conviction to continued upside; a bearish crossover suggests weakening momentum or a potential reversal, especially if accompanied by price testing or breaking below the 50/200 SMAs.
- RSI context: RSI rising toward overbought (near 70) in a strong uptrend may still push higher if the trend remains intact; RSI divergence (price making new highs, RSI not) could warn of exhaustion. In downtrends, RSI near or below 30 can signal oversold conditions but should be filtered by trend signals.
- Bollinger bands: Price touching the boll_ub can indicate an overbought or breakout zone, particularly if accompanied by rising volume. Price testing boll (middle) can act as a dynamic support/resistance frontier; breaches of boll_ub with strong VWMA-confirmed volume may precede a breakout.
- VWMA: A move where price and VWMA align (price above VWMA with VWMA trending up) strengthens the case for a sustained move, while price crossing below VWMA with volume spikes can signal a shift in participation and potential reversal.
- Interaction of signals: The most robust setups occur when multiple indicators align (e.g., price above 50/200 SMA, MACD positive crossover, RSI not overextended, price hugging or breaking above boll_ub with solid VWMA confirmation). Conversely, conflicting signals (e.g., price above 50/200 but RSI diverging and MACD weakening) warrant caution and tighter risk controls.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching SPY data and generate a full, numerically grounded report with the chosen indicators, including current readings, crossovers, RSI levels, Bollinger band interactions, and VWMA confirmation.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a staged approach: first pull price data, then compute and present the indicators one by one, followed by a trading-apply synthesis.

Proposed 8-indicator quick-reference table (interpretive guidance)
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for SPY | Trading cue (simplified) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend base | Price above indicates uptrend; price below indicates downtrend; cross of price above/below 50_SMA can signal pullbacks or entries | Above trend: look for bullish setups; below: be cautious |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200_SMA suggests long-term uptrend; below suggests long-term weakness | Golden/death-cross context matters; use with other signals |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | MACD cross above MACD_signal = bullish momentum; cross below = bearish momentum | Use crossovers with other filters to confirm entries |
| macds | MACD signal line | Supports MACD cross interpretations; smoother signal line reference | Confirm with price action and/or SMA trend |
| rsi | Momentum strength | RSI rising but not overbought is constructive in uptrends; overbought readings need trend context | Watch for divergences and overextension |
| boll | Bollinger middle (20-SMA) baseline | Price near/below middle indicates mean-reversion potential; interaction with bands signals volatility regime | Breakouts often occur with band touches and volume confirmation |
| boll_ub | Upper Bollinger Band | Price touches or breaches boll_ub can signal overbought zones or breakout potential, especially with volume | Use with price action and VWMA for confirmation |
| vwma | Volume-weighted trend confirmation | Price moves corroborated by rising VWMA imply stronger participation and durability | Look for price above VWMA with VWMA trending up for sustainable moves |

If you’d like, I can retry the data pull now and, once successful, deliver a detailed, numbers-backed report that includes current readings, trend strength, and concrete entry/exit ideas aligned with these indicators. Please tell me whether you want me to retry the data fetch immediately or proceed with the qualitative framework and wait for the data to be available.
