Recommendation: SELL SPY (reduce exposure) with hedging and a staged, risk-managed approach. This aligns with macro/rate uncertainty, breadth risk, and data-gap concerns highlighted in the plan, and it preserves liquidity and optionality for a later re-entry.

Rationale and key actions:
- Why: Macro regime risk and rate uncertainty, breadth concentration on a few mega-caps, and potential data gaps (sentiment signals) create downside risk that a core long SPY without hedges may not withstand.
- Core reduction: Scale SPY exposure to roughly 40–60% of the prior full allocation over 2–4 weeks, transitioning from a full to a guarded core.
- Hedging: Implement protective hedges (e.g., long puts with 12–18 month duration near ATM to 5–10% OTM, or a collar strategy financed by selling calls). If cost is prohibitive, consider cheaper near-term put spreads to establish a defined floor.
- Tactical tilts (optional): If breadth deteriorates further, tilt toward defensives (staples, utilities, healthcare) while maintaining liquidity; keep cash/T-bills as optionality.
- Re-entry triggers and pacing: Rebuild exposure only on confirmed breadth expansion and trend resilience (breadth broader, SPY clears meaningful trend levels, not overbought RSI, volatility contained). Use incremental tranches (2–4 steps) rather than a full reset.
- Risk controls: Limit exposure per tranche (e.g., 2–4% of portfolio per tranche), establish price/volatility stops, and use multiple signal sources to avoid data-gap overreliance.
- Review cadence: Weekly reassessment of breadth, macro data, and hedge effectiveness; adjust hedges and exposure gradually as new data arrives.

Lessons applied:
- Don’t rely on a single signal or a data feed—emphasize breadth confirmation and multiple indicators.
- Hedge and stage risk before increasing exposure; avoid all-in, unhedged bets.
- Use data-gap awareness to anchor decisions in price/action and macro signals rather than sentiment alone.
- Have defined triggers for re-entry to prevent ad-hoc chasing.
