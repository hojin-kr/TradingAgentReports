I attempted to pull the PLTR fundamentals data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) but ran into an internal file-not-found error with the data tools. I can retry the data pulls, but I’m also happy to proceed with a high-quality qualitative analysis or a best-effort quantitative snapshot using publicly available information if you’d like. Here are your options:

Options to proceed
- Retry data pulls now: I’ll try calling the five data tools again (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement) and report back with a full, integrated fundamental analysis once the data is retrieved.
- Qualitative/best-effort analysis: I’ll provide a comprehensive fundamental overview of Palantir (PLTR) using publicly known information up to the latest available quarter, clearly labeling data gaps and offering trader-oriented insights (strengths, risks, liquidity, profitability trends, and insider activity themes) without exact numeric figures.
- Hybrid approach: I’ll provide a structured framework and methodology, then retry the data pulls in parallel. If any tool still fails, I’ll fill in with best-effort qualitative notes for the missing parts.

If you’d like me to proceed immediately with a qualitative/best-effort analysis (no tool calls needed right now), I’ll cover:
- Company profile and business model (government vs commercial segments, product lines, moat, competitive landscape)
- Revenue and earnings trajectory (growth rate, gross margin, operating margin, cash flow from operations, free cash flow)
- Balance sheet health (liquidity, leverage, working capital dynamics)
- Cash flow profile (capital expenditure, free cash flow evolution, sustainability)
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions themes (how recent insider activity may reflect confidence or concerns)
- Key risks (valuation, contract concentration, customer mix, geopolitical/regulatory factors)
- Key takeaways for traders (what would make PLTR more attractive or riskier under different scenarios)

Appendix: proposed Markdown table (to be filled with actual data when available)

Please tell me which path you prefer:
1) Retry the five data pulls now, hoping to fetch the latest numbers
2) Proceed with the qualitative/best-effort fundamental analysis (no live data fetch)
3) Hybrid approach (retry but also prepare a qualitative overlay as a fallback)

Once you choose, I’ll deliver the analysis in a detailed, trader-focused format and, if you pick option 1 or 3, I’ll include a final Markdown table summarizing the key points.
