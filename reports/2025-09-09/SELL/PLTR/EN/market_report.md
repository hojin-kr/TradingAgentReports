I attempted to fetch PLTR data with get_YFin_data but the tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can retry, or we can try an alternate date range (shorter window or different start date). If you’d like, I can also proceed with the indicator plan now and run the analyses as soon as the data retrieval issue is resolved.

Proposed indicator set (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
1) close_50_sma
- Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm the prevailing trend for PLTR and filters out some noise when used with faster indicators.

2) close_200_sma
- Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for identifying major trend context (golden cross/death cross) and aligning risk/position sizing with the larger regime.

3) macd
- Why: Momentum and potential trend-change signals via MACD line crossovers. Adds a momentum perspective that complements price/price-averages.

4) macds
- Why: MACD Signal line crossovers provide confirmation for MACD-derived entry/exit signals and help reduce false positives from raw MACD.

5) macdh
- Why: MACD histogram offers visual momentum strength and early divergence signals, useful for spotting waning or accelerating momentum before MACD crossovers.

6) rsi
- Why: Momentum/overbought-oversold context. Complements trend indicators by signaling exhaustion or potential reversals, especially useful in choppy markets.

7) atr
- Why: Volatility baseline for risk management. Helps set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizing according to current market volatility around PLTR.

8) vwma
- Why: Volume-weighted trend confirmation. Integrates price action with volume to validate uptrends or downtrends, useful for confirming breakout-like moves in PLTR.

Notes on interpretation guidance for PLTR (once data is available)
- Trend confirmation: If 50SMA is above 200SMA and price trades above both, expect a bullish bias. Look for MACD bullish cross and RSI rising without hitting overbought extremes for potential entries; use ATR to size stops.
- Momentum checks: A bullish MACD crossover with a rising MACD histogram (macdh) near or above zero adds conviction. Conversely, a negative MACD crossover with a widening negative histogram warns of a potential pullback.
- Reversals: RSI divergences (price making higher highs while RSI makes lower highs, or vice versa) can precede reversals. Confirm with price-structure signals and MACD/macd_s crossovers.
- Volatility management: ATR rising suggests widening moves and warrants larger stops; ATR shrinking can imply consolidation and tighter risk controls.
- Volume validation: VWMA rising with price action supports a sustainable move; declining VWMA or price moving on light volume may indicate a fragile move or a possible pullback.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A detailed, nuanced report describing how PLTR is behaving across these indicators, including:
  - Current trend context (short/medium/long-term) with SMA crossovers.
  - Momentum signals from MACD family and RSI, with identified potential entry/exit points.
  - Volatility and risk metrics from ATR and how to set stops.
  - Volume-backed trend confirmation via VWMA.
  - Any divergences or confluences that suggest stronger signals or cautions.
- A concise, trader-friendly verdict (BUY/HOLD/SELL) only after synthesizing the eight indicators and confirming alignment, if a trading decision is warranted.

Markdown table: key indicators and their role
- Indicator | What it measures | How it helps with PLTR
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and support/resistance | Confirms trend context; aids timing with faster signals
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend context | Filters decisions by broader regime; signals major trend shifts
- macd | Momentum and trend-change signals | Detects shifts in momentum; crossovers validate entries/exits
- macds | MACD signal line crossover | Reduces false positives; reinforces MACD signals
- macdh | MACD histogram momentum strength | Early momentum cues and divergence signals
- rsi | Relative momentum and overbought/oversold | Signals potential reversals; divergence clues
- atr | Market volatility for risk management | Guides stop placement and position sizing
- vwma | Volume-weighted price trend | Validates moves with volume; confirms trend strength

Next steps
- Please confirm if you’d like me to retry get_YFin_data with the same range, or provide an alternate date range (e.g., shorter window like 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-09) or allow me to proceed with the indicator plan and run once the data issue is resolved.
- If you have a preferred trading style (e.g., swing trading, intraday, long-term investing) or a risk tolerance, share it so I can tailor the interpretation and any required thresholds accordingly.
