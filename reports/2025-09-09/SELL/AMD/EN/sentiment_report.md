Sorry — I hit an internal error with the Reddit data tool while trying to fetch AMD posts for 2025-09-09. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the Reddit-sourced sentiment data to include yet.

Here are options to move forward:
- I can retry the Reddit data fetch now and proceed with the full long report once I have the data.
- If you prefer not to wait, I can proceed with a detailed framework-driven report using available public news and general sentiment patterns, clearly marking where Reddit data would be incorporated once retrieved.
- I can also pull in any additional sources you’d like (e.g., notable news outlets, press releases) in parallel if you want a broader view.

Plan for the full AMD report (once Reddit data is retrieved):
- Executive snapshot: overall mood from Reddit posts over the past week, key sentiment drivers (bullets on positive vs negative themes).
- Daily sentiment trend: day-by-day polarity and volume, with notable spikes tied to any events or announcements.
- Topic and rhetoric analysis: common themes (GPU launches, AI accelerators, supply chain, pricing, drivers, driver software, gaming vs enterprise data center) and how sentiment evolved around each.
- News correlation: how recent AMD news (earnings, product launches, partnerships, supply/demand signals) aligned with social sentiment shifts.
- Risk factors and catalysts: potential downside/upside catalysts derived from sentiment dynamics and the news cycle.
- Trader/Investor implications: actionable takeaways, typical reaction patterns to watch for (e.g., sentiment-led short-term squeezes, cyclical sentiment around product cycles, etc.).
- Key data visuals (described): sentiment distribution, top keywords, volume over time, sentiment vs. notable news events.
- Makrdown table: a concise synthesis of the above points for quick reference.

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry of the Reddit data fetch right now and then deliver the full, detailed long report with a Makrdown table at the end. Please confirm how you’d like to proceed.
