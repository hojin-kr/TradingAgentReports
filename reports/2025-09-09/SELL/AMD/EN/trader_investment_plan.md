Based on the proposed investment plan and the current risk environment, the actionable takeaway is to SELL AMD (or materially trim long exposure) and implement hedges to manage downside risk while preserving some upside optionality.

Rationale
- Near-term catalysts are uncertain: backlog visibility, MI/EPYC ramp, and ROCm traction need clearer, data-driven confirmation. Without those, the bear case around execution risk and competitive dynamics remains front-and-center.
- Competitive landscape: Nvidia’s ecosystem moat and CUDA/ROCm adoption create a meaningful near-term headwind for AMD’s share gains, especially if hyperscalers delay or reoptimize capex.
- Macro and regulatory headwinds: Data-center upgrades and AI deployments can be delayed by macro uncertainty and export controls, amplifying downside risk in the near term.
- Risk-reward skew: The plan emphasizes timing-driven catalysts that are not reliably visible in the near term, making downside risk asymmetric relative to potential upside catalysts.

Concrete actions
- If you’re already long: trim exposure by a substantial amount (roughly 40–60%) to reduce downside risk, unless you’re employing a hedged strategy.
- Hedging strategies (to consider, depending on risk tolerance and liquidity):
  - Buy at-the-money or slightly in-the-money put options expiring 1–2 quarters out to establish a protective floor.
  - Alternatively, implement a bear collar: long put near current level and short OTM call to finance the puts, aiming for a net low or zero cost.
  - Put calendar spread for a more gradual cost profile and to mitigate time decay while maintaining protection.
- Risk triggers and management:
  - If AMD trades below a defined support zone or a key moving average crossover (e.g., 50-day SMA below 200-day SMA) with negative momentum signals, increase hedges or deepen the trim.
  - If there is credible backlog uptick or MI/EPYC order flow improvement, reassess hedge size and consider partial unwind.
- Portfolio context:
  - Keep position sizing modest in AMD due to its high beta and sensitivity to headlines.
  - Pair with hedges or less-risky tech exposures to smooth volatility.

Monitoring and next steps
- Watch quarterly results for MI/EPYC backlog trends, enterprise wins, and ROCm momentum.
- Monitor hyperscaler commentary, AI capex signals, and regulatory developments affecting AI deployments.
- If catalysts materialize clearly (backlog ramp, software traction, real share gains), re-evaluate the thesis and consider partial or full unwind of hedges.

Final
- Decision: SELL (or materially trim) with hedges to manage risk, given near-term downside catalysts and the less certain near-term backlog/MI ramp despite a plausible longer-term bull case.
