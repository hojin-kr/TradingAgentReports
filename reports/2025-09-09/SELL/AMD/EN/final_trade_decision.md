Decision: SELL

Recommendation: Sell (or materially trim) AMD now and implement hedges to protect downside while preserving optionality for any upside surprise.

Why this decision follows from the debate
- Strongest near-term risk signals exist, even if the long-run AI thesis is intact:
  - Bear/Conservative emphasis: “Near-term AI demand signals are choppy... backlog ramp and MI/EPYC ramp” and a macro/regulatory backdrop can delay data-center upgrades. The bear case highlights that sentiment can overcorrect before fundamentals recover.
  - Risky’s view reinforces this with a clear emphasis on asymmetric downside protection: “Near-term catalysts are uncertain, but the setup is still highly asymmetric” and the plan to trim now while hedging to monetize downside protection.
- The bear consensus is explicit about downside risk dominating the near term:
  - “Definitive stance: Sell. Short- to medium-term downside risk dominates the near-term risk-reward,” with concern about backlog visibility, execution risk, and Nvidia-led ecosystem headwinds.
- The Neutral view adds balance but does not contradict the core risk: it urges hedging and a measured trim rather than adding aggressively to the long. The Safe view explicitly concludes with a sell/trim posture with hedges, underscoring conviction on risk controls.

Direct quotes and how they support the plan
- Bear-definitive stance: “Definitive stance: Sell. Short- to medium-term downside risk dominates the near-term risk-reward...” This anchors the core decision.
- Risky framing: “Near-term catalysts are uncertain, but the setup is still highly asymmetric... trim now and hedging to monetize downside protection while preserving optionality.”
- Safe framing: “Bottom line — SELL (or materially trim) with hedges to manage risk…” This reinforces the recommended action and the hedging approach.
- Neutral context: “Core idea: reduce exposure to a sensible, non-binary degree and implement cost-efficient downside protection…” which aligns with a hedged, partial exposure stance rather than a full long or full exit.

Concrete, actionable plan you can act on
1) Immediate stance and sizing
- Primary action: Sell AMD now or materially trim your existing long exposure by 40–60%.
- If you want hedged exposure instead of outright sale: implement hedges that limit downside while preserving upside potential (bearish protection financed by limited upside cap).

2) Hedge structure options (cost-efficient and scalable)
- Default hedge: bear collar
  - Buy an at-the-money (or slightly in-the-money) put expiring roughly 6–9 months out.
  - Finance with a short, out-of-the-money call to keep net cost near zero or with a small credit.
  - Purpose: protect below a floor while preserving upside optionality if AMD surprises to the upside.
- Backup hedge: put calendar spread
  - Long a nearer-term ATM/ITM put and fund with a longer-dated put at the same strike.
  - Purpose: reduce time decay costs while maintaining longer-dated protection.
- Alternative if costs are high: bear put spread
  - Buy an ATM/ITM put and sell a lower-strike put to reduce upfront premium while accepting a defined downside cap.

3) Positioning and risk management
- Hedge sizing: target hedges that cover a meaningful portion of downside risk on the long exposure (roughly 50–75% of the planned long exposure after trimming). Adjust based on liquidity and premium costs.
- Time horizon: focus on the next 1–3 quarters; catalysts or disappointing signals in that window will drive the hedge readjustments.
- Triggers to adjust hedges (mechanistic, not discretionary):
  - If price action shows sustained weakness: AMD trades below 50-day and 200-day SMAs, MACD bearish, RSI under midline, or ATR expanding without bullish confirmation → increase hedge size or deepen trims in increments (e.g., add 10–15% of hedge notional per trigger).
  - If backlog/MI/EPYC indicators show credible improvement: progressively unwind hedges in staged steps and consider re-risking portions of the trim.
- Portfolio context: keep AMD as a smaller, risk-managed sleeve within a diversified book; pair with hedges or less volatile tech exposures to smooth volatility.

4) Monitoring and catalysts
- Key near-term data: quarterly results focusing on MI/EPYC backlog trends, ROCm momentum, and enterprise wins; hyperscaler commentary on AI capex cadence.
- Macro/regulatory watch: export controls and broader AI deployment timing; treat as risk events that justify protecting capital with hedges.

5) Execution mindset and data notes
- You’ll want precise, data-driven trigger levels tied to the 8-indicator framework (close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, MACD, MACDS, MACDH, RSI, ATR). If you want, I’ll pull the latest AMD price/indicator readings and tailor exact hedge strikes, expirations, and notional amounts to your risk tolerance the moment data access is restored.
- If catalysts materialize (clear backlog uptick, ROCm traction, enterprise wins) you can unwind hedges gradually and re-risk portions of the trim to participate in upside.

Two quick scenario snapshots to guide execution
- Bearish scenario (the most likely near term if data disappoints):
  - AMD breaks key supports, MACD weakens, RSI erodes toward 30–40. Action: full/near-full hedge scaling, deeper trim, and potentially add to protection or layered hedges to preserve capital.
- Neutral/base scenario (ambiguous near term, but catalysts may show later):
  - Price meanders near support with mixed indicator signals. Action: maintain hedges at a moderate level, ready to adjust as backlog/MI/EPYC data become clearer; look for relief rallies to unwind a portion of protection gradually.
- Bullish scenario (less likely in near term but possible):
  - Clear backlog ramp and ROCm traction; price breaks above key SMA crossovers with constructive momentum. Action: unwind hedges in stages, re-risk exposure, and participate in upside with a smaller long core.

Bottom line
- Decision: Sell (or materially trim) with hedges.
- Rationale: Near-term downside risk dominates the risk-reward due to uncertain backlog/MI/EPYC ramp, Nvidia’s ecosystem moat, and macro/regulatory headwinds. The bull case relies on timing-dependent catalysts that aren’t reliably visible yet; hedged selling or trimming preserves capital while keeping optionality for future upside.
- Next steps: implement the hedged trim plan, use cost-efficient hedges (bear collar or calendar puts), set mechanistic risk triggers, and monitor backlog/enterprise signals to re‑risk if and when catalysts materialize.

If you want, I can assemble a precise hedge parameter set (strike choices, expiration dates, notional allocations) and two crisp scenario matrices (2–4 weeks and 6–12 weeks) tailored to your risk tolerance as soon as data access returns.
