I attempted to fetch AMD data for the period needed, but the data retrieval tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry shortly, but in the meantime here’s a detailed, structured framework using a curated set of indicators (up to 8) that will give you complementary, non-redundant insights once the data is available. This should help you interpret AMD’s setup as soon as the data comes through.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s relevant for AMD: AMD’s price often respects the 50SMA during tech cycles and AI/GPU demand shifts. Useful for validating mid-term trend and potential pullbacks to a dynamic floor.
- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend benchmark; golden/death cross context.
  - Why it’s relevant for AMD: Long-cycle perspective helps distinguish secular uptrends from bear phases in a volatile semiconductor cycle.
- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average; responsive short-term momentum.
  - Why it’s relevant for AMD: Captures quick shifts in momentum, helpful for early entries or exits in a choppy market.
- macd
  - What it measures: MACD line vs. signal line; momentum shifts and trend changes.
  - Why it’s relevant for AMD: Broad momentum signals that can align with or diverge from price trends as AI/semiconductor news drives moves.
- macds
  - What it measures: MACD signal line (EMA-smoothed MACD line).
  - Why it’s relevant for AMD: Crosses of MACD vs. MACDS can confirm entries/exits when combined with price action.
- macdh
  - What it measures: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence signals.
  - Why it’s relevant for AMD: Histogram changes offer early momentum cues, especially around earnings or AI-related news catalysts.
- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index; momentum magnitude and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why it’s relevant for AMD: Helps spot potential reversals in strong uptrends or downtrends; beware of persistent overbought readings in strong rallies.
- atr
  - What it measures: Average True Range; volatility level and range dynamics.
  - Why it’s relevant for AMD: AMD often experiences elevated volatility around product launches, supply cycle news, or AI demand shifts; use ATR to size positions and set stops adaptively.

How to interpret signals (high-level guide)
- Bullish setup (confluence toward upside)
  - Price above 50SMA and 200SMA, with 50SMA above 200SMA (positive trend alignment).
  - MACD line above MACDS and both rising; MACD histogram positive and widening.
  - RSI trending upward but not overbought (e.g., 40–70 range, with rising RSI).
  - ATR trending higher or stable at elevated levels (implies sustained volatility; manage risk accordingly).
  - Interpretation: Moderate-to-strong uptrend with rising momentum; consider pullback entries around dips toward 50SMA/200SMA with favorable MACD/macd signals.
- Bearish setup (confluence toward downside)
  - Price below 50SMA and/or 200SMA; potential cross of 50SMA below 200SMA (death cross).
  - MACD line below MACDS and both descending; MACD histogram negative and expanding.
  - RSI rolling over, crossing below midline (e.g., 50) or failing to hold prior highs.
  - ATR elevated but price action confirming downside (risk is asymmetric with macro/earnings catalysts).
  - Interpretation: Downside trend/weakness with deteriorating momentum; look for breakdown signals or failed rallies.
- Caution/nuance
  - In a strong uptrend, RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; avoid selling solely on overbought readings without corroborating trend signals.
  - MACD histogram can diverge from price in some setups; cross-confirm with price action and SMA relationships.
  - Volatility spikes (high ATR) can widen spreads and lead to false breakouts; use ATR for stop placement and position sizing.

Next steps and data retry
- I can retry fetching AMD data (Yahoo Finance) to compute these indicators and provide a precise, data-backed read. Please confirm you’d like me to retry now, or specify a time to retry.
- If you prefer, I can also switch to an alternative data window (e.g., 3–6 months, or year-to-date) once data access is restored.

Key points in a concise summary
- Indicators chosen provide a balanced view: trend (50SMA, 200SMA), momentum (10_EMA, MACD family, RSI), and volatility (ATR).
- They cover short-term to long-term dynamics and help with entry/exit decisions, risk management, and awareness of potential reversals in AMD’s volatile semiconductor/AI cycle.
- Data availability is the current blocker; once data returns, I’ll generate concrete latest-value readings and precise signal flags aligned with these indicators.

Markdown table: quick reference for the chosen indicators
| Indicator | What it measures | Why it helps for AMD now | Signals to watch (simplified) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day trend, dynamic support/resistance | Mid-term trend guidance; AMD sensitivity to AI/semiconductor cycles | Price > 50SMA with 50SMA > 200SMA = bullish; price crossing below 50SMA = caution |
| close_200_sma | 200-day trend benchmark | Long-term context; assess secular vs. cyclical moves | Golden cross (50SMA above 200SMA after uptrend) = bullish; death cross = bearish |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Captures quick shifts; useful for timing | Price above 10-EMA and rising = bullish momentum; cross below = bearish momentum |
| macd | Momentum trend changes | Broad momentum signal; works with price trends | MACD > MACDS and rising = bullish momentum; MACD crossing below = bearish |
| macds | MACD signal line | Confirms MACD-derived signals | MACD crossing above MACDS = potential buy; crossing below = sell |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength; early divergence cues | Positive histogram widening = stronger up-move; negative/expanding = down-move |
| rsi | Momentum magnitude; overbought/oversold | Divergence and pullback/reversal cues | RSI rising toward 70; watch for bearish divergence; RSI below 30 = oversold risk |
| atr | Volatility level | Risk management; stop placement for AMD’s swings | Rising ATR implies higher risk/volatility; use for wider stops or position sizing adjustments |

If you’d like, I can attempt the data fetch again now and then provide the exact latest indicator readings and a narrative trend report based on the actual values. Would you like me to retry the data retrieval for AMD now?
