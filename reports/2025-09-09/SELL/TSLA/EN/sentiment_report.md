Sorry about that — the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It seems to be a runtime issue on the tool side right now.

Here are two options. Let me know which you prefer:

Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now
- I’ll attempt to pull TSLA-related Reddit sentiment for 2025-09-09 again and then deliver a comprehensive long-form report (social sentiment, daily sentiment trends, recent news, and trader-oriented insights), followed by a Markdown table of key points.

Option B: Proceed with a best-effort analysis without the Reddit feed
- I’ll synthesize TSLA sentiment drivers and recent news from publicly known sources, focusing on how social chatter and headlines typically affect traders (without live Reddit data). I’ll still deliver a detailed, trader-focused report with insights and a Markdown table at the end.

If you’d like, I can also mix: retry now for Reddit data and, while waiting, start drafting the analysis framework so you get something actionable right away.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you choose Option A, I’ll retry immediately and then provide the full report with the Markdown table. If you choose Option B, I’ll proceed with the best-effort analysis right away.
