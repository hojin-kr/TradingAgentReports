Data fetch attempt failed.

What happened
- I tried to pull TSLA data for insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the quarterly balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement, but the tool layer returned FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) for all requests. This looks like an environment/tool availability issue rather than a problem with TSLA data itself.

What I can do next
- Retry the data pulls now or at a time you specify.
- If the tool environment remains unavailable, I can still provide a thorough fundamental report framework and proceed with qualitative analysis based on public information you’re comfortable me relying on, clearly labeled as not tool-derived.

Proposed plan for the comprehensive fundamental report (TSLA, as of 2025-09-09)
- Company profile and business model
  - Brief overview of segments (Vehicles, Energy, Services), geographic exposure, major risks and catalysts.
- Basic company financials (historical context)
  - Key revenue drivers, scale of operations, and how revenue mix has evolved.
- Income statement overview (quarterly/TTM)
  - Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, margins (gross, operating, net), EBITDA where relevant.
- Balance sheet snapshot
  - Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable/payable, inventory, property, plant & equipment, total assets, total liabilities, shareholders’ equity, net debt, liquidity metrics.
- Cash flow statement
  - Cash flow from operating activities, investing activities (CAPEX), financing activities, free cash flow, cash conversion cycle insights.
- Financial history and trends
  - Revenue growth rate, margin progression, capital intensity (CAPEX vs depreciation), profitability trajectory, cash flow quality, any material one-time items.
- Capital structure and liquidity
  - Debt levels, interest coverage, liquidity buffers, credit facilities, covenant considerations (if applicable).
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 30 days)
  - Net sentiment direction, notable insider buys/sells, concentration of activity among executives or board members, potential implications for the stock.
- Valuation context (brief, if relevant)
  - How fundamentals relate to valuation signals like P/E, EV/EBITDA, FCF yield, and any notable multiple compression/expansion drivers.
- Trader-focused takeaways
  - What the above means for momentum, risk, and name-specific catalysts or red flags in the near-to-medium term.

Markdown table (structure you can expect at the end of the final report)
- I will populate this with the actual numbers once the data pulls succeed.

Next steps – your call
1) I can retry the data pulls immediately to populate the report with the latest figures.
2) Or, if you prefer not to wait, I can proceed with a qualitative TSLA fundamentals overview based on public, non-tool data, clearly labeled as such.

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with the qualitative overview? If retrying, I’ll report back with the updated numbers as soon as the tools are available.
