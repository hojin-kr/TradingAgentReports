Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch TSLA data with the YFin data tool, but I hit a backend error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data fetch now, or adjust the date window if you prefer. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a focused, non-redundant set of indicators (8 total) that provide complementary insights for TSLA given a mid-to-long-term horizon and current market dynamics.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators):
- close_50_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Captures the medium-term trend and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Helps gauge whether price is generally above/below the mid-term trend.
- close_200_sma (Moving Averages)
  - Why: Establishes the long-term trend context. Useful for confirming overall market direction and potential golden/death cross setups.
- macd (MACD)
  - Why: Momentum-based indicator that highlights trend strength and potential reversals via crossovers with its signal line.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - Why: Smoother signal line to confirm the MACD-derived signals, reducing false entries when used with other signals.
- rsi (Momentum)
  - Why: Momentum oscillator to spot overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences, useful in conjunction with trend signals.
- atr (Volatility)
  - Why: Measures true market volatility; helps set risk controls and adaptive position sizing (e.g., stop placement).
- vwma (Volume-Based)
  - Why: Volume-weighted trend confirmation; helps validate price moves with market participation and avoid false signals in low-volume periods.
- boll_ub (Bollinger Upper Band)
  - Why: Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones when price interacts with the upper band; adds a breakout/divergence lens in volatile moves.

Why this set is complementary and not redundant:
- Combines both trend (50/200 SMA) and momentum (MACD/RSI) for entry/exit context.
- Adds volatility (ATR) for risk management and position sizing, plus a volume-confirmation (VWMA) to avoid price moves lacking conviction.
- Uses Bollinger upper band (boll_ub) to identify potential breakout zones and overbought dynamics, without duplicating RSI’s overbought readings.

Next steps:
- I can retry fetching TSLA data from Yahoo Finance (2024-04-01 to 2025-09-09, as requested) and then compute these indicators. If you’d like, I can also:
  - Narrow the date window (e.g., last 12 months) to reduce data gaps.
  - Use a shorter range for more responsive signals.
  - Try a one-shot fetch with a different data source if available.
- After data is retrieved, I’ll produce a detailed, nuanced TSLA trend report, including:
  - Price action interpretation (short-term, medium-term, long-term view)
  - Indicator-driven signals with potential entry/exit zones
  - Risk management considerations using ATR and VWMA
  - A concise summary table of key observations

Markdown table (indicator plan for TSLA):
- Indicator | Category | Rationale
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation and macro context
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum trend changes and crossovers
- macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD signals to filter noise
- rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context and potential divergences
- atr | Volatility | Volatility-based risk control and stop-placement guidance
- vwma | Volume-Based | Trend confirmation with volume; filters price moves
- boll_ub | Bollinger Upper Band | Potential breakout/overbought zones; confirms volatility regime

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry the data fetch now (same range: 2024-04-01 to 2025-09-09), or would you prefer a shorter window (e.g., last 12–18 months) to improve reliability?
- If you have a preferred data source or date range, share it and I’ll adapt. 

Once you confirm, I’ll fetch the data, compute the 8 indicators, and deliver a detailed TSLA trend report with a practical set of actionable insights (plus a results table).
