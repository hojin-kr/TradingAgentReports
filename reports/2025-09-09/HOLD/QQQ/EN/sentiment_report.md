Thanks for the update. The Reddit data tool you asked me to use is currently returning a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t fetch live posts right now. I’ll proceed with a thorough, forward-looking analysis for QQQ (the Nasdaq-100 ETF) using a structured framework you can rely on while we wait for the data tool to come back online. Once the Reddit data tool is working again, I’ll overlay the actual daily sentiment signals and pull in daily news sentiment to update the report.

Below is a comprehensive long-form analysis you can use now, followed by a Markdown table with key points. When the Reddit feed is available again, I’ll append precise sentiment deltas and day-by-day chatter.

Executive snapshot
- Instrument: QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF)
- Context: QQQ tracks a concentrated basket of large-cap tech and growth names. Its price action is heavily influenced by technology sector earnings, AI/tech policy developments, interest rate expectations, and broader risk sentiment.
- What to monitor now: adjacent macro backdrop (inflation, rates, QT), mega-cap tech earnings cadence, AI/innovation narratives, and any geopolitical or supply-chain shocks affecting large-cap tech.

Social sentiment overview (framework, pending data)
- What social sentiment typically reveals for QQQ:
  - Mega-cap tech talk (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, META) tends to drive most daily chatter. Positive sentiment often coincides with favorable quarterly results, AI breakthroughs, or strong guidance from these names; negative sentiment spikes around disappointment or guidance misses.
  - AI hype cycles can create short-lived surges in optimism, followed by pullbacks if gains seem unsustainable or if valuations appear stretched.
  - Rotation between growth/tech leadership and broader market risk-off periods can cause cyclic swings in sentiment, even when macro indicators are mixed.
- Expected daily pattern (hypothetical without current data):
  - Mondays/market opens: sentiment often reacts to weekend headlines and pre-market guidance.
  - Earnings season: spikes in both directions around big-cap results; relevance is magnified for QQQ due to weightings.
  - Broad macro days: sentiment can drift negative if rates rise or growth expectations cool, even if tech fundamentals are sound.
- Limitations: Without real-time Reddit data, I can’t provide precise day-by-day sentiment scores or identify top hot topics. I’ll ingest and synthesize that once the tool is available again.

Recent news pulse (categories to watch)
- Earnings and guidance from top holdings (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, META) and their impact on tech leadership and valuations.
- AI policy/ethics discussions and any regulatory probes affecting big tech.
- Macroeconomic updates (inflation prints, Fed communications, unemployment data) and whether they push rate expectations up or down.
- Supply-chain and geopolitics affecting semiconductor suppliers and cloud infrastructure (critical for several QQQ components).
- Market structure shifts (growth rotation, sector leadership changes) and ETF flows into/out of tech-focused vehicles.

Implications for traders and investors
- Concentration risk: QQQ is heavily weighted toward a few mega-cap tech names. Positive/negative news on these leaders tends to move QQQ disproportionately, more so than broad-market ETFs.
- Reward drivers: AI advancements, cloud growth, and software/services expansion among top holdings can sustain upside momentum for the ETF during tech-led rallies.
- Valuation and rate sensitivity: If rates stay low or fall, tech growth can remain attractive, supporting QQQ. If rates rise or growth expectations cool, QQQ may see sharper volatility given its growth tilt.
- Risk signals to watch:
  - Divergence between price action of top holdings and the broader market (broad-based weakness with only a few names leading).
  - Shifts in implied volatility around tech earnings windows or AI-related announcements.
  - Flow data indicating renewed institution or retail interest in large-cap tech ETFs.

What to monitor next (checklist)
- Daily sentiment signals for AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, META, and the overall QQQ basket.
- Upcoming earnings calendars for the top-weighted constituents and any guidance updates.
- Macro disclosures on rates, inflation, and liquidity conditions.
- Any regulatory or geopolitical headlines that could impact tech capital expenditure or supply chains.
- Option market signals around earnings or policy events (skew, put/call ratios) to gauge hedging intensity.

Analytical takeaways for positioning (non-prescriptive)
- Short-term (days to weeks): Be attentive to earnings cadence and AI-related news. Expect heightened volatility during major events; use those windows to reassess risk exposures in the ETF’s top-weighted names.
- Intermediate-term (weeks to a few months): If tech earnings stay resilient and macro easing persists, upside for QQQ could persist. Watch for breadth vs. leadership: broad participation supports more durable moves than a narrow leadership rally.
- Long-term (quarterly horizon): Structural tech demand and AI-driven productivity trends can support multi-quarter upside, but valuations and rate expectations remain key risk factors.

Data gaps and next steps
- Once the Reddit data tool is back online, I will:
  - Pull daily Reddit sentiment for QQQ and for its top constituent names.
  - Compute day-over-day sentiment deltas and identify top trending topics influencing QQQ chatter.
  - Correlate sentiment with short-term price moves and with news sentiment (positive/negative news events).
  - Deliver a refreshed, data-backed sentiment heatmap and a day-by-day narrative.

If you’d like, I can also create a structured template you can paste into your notes or a report, which will be ready to fill in as soon as the Reddit tool comes back. Additionally, I can run parallel analysis using alternative data sources (e.g., X sentiment, general news sentiment, ETF flow data) to provide a cross-check until Reddit data is available.

Would you like me to proceed with an alternative sentiment triangulation (using other public sources) while we wait for the Reddit tool to recover? If you have any specific time window (e.g., last 7 days) you want prioritized, tell me and I’ll tailor the framework accordingly.
