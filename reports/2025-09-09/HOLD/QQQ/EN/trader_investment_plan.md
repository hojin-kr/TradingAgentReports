Recommendation: Hold with hedges and a disciplined risk framework. This aligns with the provided plan, which recognizes upside from AI-enabled growth while acknowledging meaningful macro, valuation, and concentration risks.

Key rationale
- Prospective upside: AI/Cloud leadership remains a durable growth driver with solid balance sheets in mega-caps.
- Key risks: Concentration risk, rate/valuation sensitivity, macro shifts, and regulatory headwinds can amplify draws if conditions deteriorate.
- Why hold now: The risk-reward is favorable for staying invested, but only with protective overlays to dampen downside and preserve optionality.

Concrete actions to implement
- Hedge/defensive overlay
  - Consider protective puts on QQQ with a horizon of 6–12 months. Choose an OTM strike around 5–15% below the current level to cap downside while limiting cost.
  - Alternatively, implement a collar: finance puts by selling slightly OTM calls. This bounds both upside and downside and lowers net hedging cost.
- Position sizing
  - Reduce naked QQQ exposure from a full overweight to a core exposure in the 40–60% range of your prior QQQ weight, with a cash sleeve available for opportunistic reallocation.
- Entry/exit rules
  - Revisit core exposure if QQQ clears a constructive trend: price action with breadth confirmation and moving averages (e.g., above a converging 50-day/200-day with supportive breadth).
  - Establish stop/gate lines: if QQQ breaks below a meaningful level (e.g., 50-day average on high volume or a top-weight name misses badly), trim further or adjust hedges.
- Diversification and risk balance
  - Introduce modest exposure to less-concentrated tech or equal-weight tech indices to reduce single-name/idiosyncratic risk.
- Monitoring cadence
  - Quarterly reviews focused on earnings trajectories of the top holdings (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN) and any regulatory developments; monitor inflation/rate expectations and adjust hedges accordingly.

Operational notes
- If you already have gains you want to protect, hedges can be cost-effective via a collar or synthetic hedges.
- If you’re starting fresh, a hedged core allows participation in upside while limiting downside risk, with optionality to scale up exposure on favorable macro signals.

Scenarios and adaptability
- If macro signals improve (inflation moderates, rates stabilize), gradually reduce hedges and tilt back toward core QQQ exposure.
- If macro or earnings risk intensifies, be prepared to tighten hedges or further reduce exposure to protect capital.
