I attempted to fetch NFLX data and indicator reports, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t access the NFLX price series or generate the indicator values at the moment. If you can re-run the data fetch or provide the data, I’ll deliver a full, data-driven, trend-by-trend analysis. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 complementary indicators tailored for NFLX, plus how they would be interpreted once the data is available.

Selected indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale for the selection
- Trend and structural view:
  - close_50_sma and close_200_sma provide a clear view of medium- and long-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance zones. Their interaction (e.g., a golden cross or death cross) offers strategic context.
- Momentum and timing:
  - close_10_ema gives a responsive read on near-term momentum, which helps in early entry/exit timing when aligned with longer-term trend signals.
  - macd and macds (MACD and its signal line) help confirm trend changes via crossovers and momentum shifts, reducing reliance on a single indicator.
- Momentum quality and potential reversals:
  - rsi highlights overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences, which can alert to reversals or pullbacks within an ongoing trend.
- Volatility and price context:
  - boll (Bollinger middle) sets a dynamic price benchmark (20-period SMA) and, when combined with price relation to the bands, helps identify breakouts or reversals in relation to volatility.
- Risk management context:
  - atr provides a measure of current volatility, useful for setting stop distances and position sizing in a stock known for thematic moves and volatility (NFLX).

How to interpret these indicators together (framework once data is available)
- Trend confirmation:
  - If price is above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, the longer-term trend is bullish; look for pullbacks toward the 50 SMA or 200 SMA for potential entries.
  - If 50 SMA is below 200 SMA, the long-term trend is bearish; be cautious with long entries and look for evidence of a potential reversal (e.g., MACD bullish cross, RSI bullish divergence).
- Momentum and timing:
  - A bullish MACD cross (MACD above its signal line) corroborated by price trading above the 50 SMA increases the probability of a sustained move.
  - A bearish MACD cross, especially if price is below the 200 SMA, strengthens the case for downside continuation or a fade of rallies.
  - A cross of price above (or below) the 10 EMA can signal near-term momentum shifts; use it in conjunction with MACD and RSI readings to avoid choppy entries.
- Reversals and overbought/oversold signals:
  - RSI approaching or exceeding 70 in an uptrend may indicate upside exhaustion or a potential pullback; look for RSI divergence with price and corroborating MACD/price bread crumbs.
  - RSI dipping toward 30 in a downtrend can hint at a short-term bounce, but confirm with MACD and price positioning relative to the SMAs.
- Volatility and risk management:
  - Bollinger middle (20 SMA) provides a dynamic anchor. Price touching the upper band with rising ATR can indicate a breakout phase; a touch near the lower band may signal oversold conditions in the right context.
  - ATR helps calibrate stop losses; higher ATR suggests wider stops and smaller position sizes to manage risk during volatile NFLX moves.

Practical steps you can take once data is available
1) Check trend anchors:
   - Is price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA? If yes, bias is bullish; if not, bias is bearish or mixed.
2) Look for conjunction signals:
   - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal line while price sits above the 50 SMA can be a stronger bullish signal; the reverse is a stronger bearish setup.
3) Confirm momentum with RSI:
   - If RSI is >70 and price is holding above the 50 SMA with a bullish MACD, monitor for a potential pullback rather than a continuation—watch for divergence signals for caution.
4) Assess volatility and risk:
   - Use ATR to set adaptive stop distances: larger ATR means wider stops; smaller ATR allows tighter risk controls.
5) Plan the entry/exit with Bollinger context:
   - Breakouts above the upper Bollinger band with strong volume (if VWMA data is available) and rising ATR can signal sustained moves; reversals near the middle or lower band may be more tradable with confirmatory MACD/RSI moves.

Notes and next steps
- I can proceed with a detailed, data-driven assessment as soon as the data fetch can be completed successfully. If you can retry the data call or provide the CSV, I will produce:
  - A granular trend assessment for NFLX as of 2025-09-09 (or your chosen date range).
  - A concise, actionable trading plan using the 8 indicators above.
  - A Markdown table summarizing the key signals, interpretations, and suggested actions.

Proposed Markdown summary table structure (for when data is available)
- Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret for NFLX | Trade implications
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Mid-term trend direction and support/resistance | Bullish if price > 50 SMA; look for pullbacks to 50 SMA as entries | Enter on pullback to 50 SMA with confirming MACD RSI
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend direction | Bullish only if price > 200 SMA and 50 SMA above 200 SMA | Favor longs in bullish regime; avoid or be cautious in bearish regime
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Crosses with price or 50/200 SMA indicate momentum shifts | Use as timing filter for entries/exits
- macd | MACD | Momentum and trend change | Bullish crossover when MACD > Signal; bearish when opposite | Use to confirm entries aligned with trend
- macds | MACD Signal | Smoothed momentum signal | Cross of MACD and MACDS strengthens entry/exit signals | Helps reduce false positives
- rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context | >70 overbought, <30 oversold; watch for divergences | Combine with trend context to assess reversals
- boll | Bollinger Middle | Price around dynamic mean; volatility context | Price near/through bands signals volatility regime; breakouts when bands are used | Use with price action and MACD RSI for breakout plays
- atr | Volatility | Market volatility level | Higher ATR implies wider price ranges; set stops accordingly | Risk management: adjust position size and stop distance

If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now or after you confirm a retry. Alternatively, you can paste the latest NFLX price data (or a CSV) and I’ll generate the eight-indicator analysis immediately.
