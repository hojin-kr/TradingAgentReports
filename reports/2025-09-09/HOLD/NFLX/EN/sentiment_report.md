Thanks for the update. I attempted to query the Reddit stock-info tool for NFLX across the requested dates, but the tool is returning a FileNotFoundError (internal issue). It looks like a temporary malfunction on the data-fetching side, so I can’t pull the Reddit sentiment data right now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now or after a short interval to see if the tool comes back online.
- Proceed with a robust qualitative analysis using other sources (public news, earnings discussions, official filings, general social sentiment) if you’re okay with that. I can still structure a detailed report and note where Reddit sentiment would be included once the tool is available.
- If you have other data sources you’d like me to incorporate (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, StockTwits, YouTube commentary, or a particular news feed), share them and I’ll integrate them.

What I can deliver right now (even without the Reddit tool data):
- A comprehensive, trader-focused long report framework for NFLX (Netflix) covering sentiment and news themes, with day-by-day sentiment angles, risk flags, and potential catalysts for the next week.
- A detailed outline of metrics to watch, including subscriber trends, pricing/tier changes, content pipeline impact (new releases, licensing deals), ad-supported strategy, and competitive positioning (Disney+, AMZN Prime Video, etc.).
- A Markdown table at the end to organize key takeaways.

Proposed structure for the NFLX long report (to be filled with data once Reddit tool is available or with alternative sources):
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment tone, major breakthroughs or concerns, and near-term catalysts.
- Daily sentiment thread (NFLX last 7 days): tone (positive/neutral/negative), top themes, notable posts, and any spikes tied to news or events.
- News and events (last 7 days): earnings cues, subscriber updates, price changes, product launches (ads tier, partnerships), content slate, regulatory or macro factors.
- Sentiment drivers analysis: what’s driving sentiment up or down (content releases, price hikes, competitive pressure, user churn concerns, platform policy changes).
- Technical alignment: if sentiment aligns with price action (breakouts, pullbacks, volume spikes) and implications for risk management.
- Risk flags: potential negative catalysts, overhangs, and scenarios that could reverse sentiment.
- Opportunities and catalysts: what data points would flip sentiment positively in the near term and how traders might position.
- Implications for trading strategies: short-term scalps vs. swing trades, risk controls, and horizon-based considerations (1–2 weeks vs. 1–3 months).
- Appendix: data sources, methodology, and caveats.

If you’d like, I can proceed immediately with this structured report using best-available public information and clearly mark placeholders where Reddit sentiment would be inserted once the tool is back online. Just confirm you’re okay with that approach, and tell me whether you want me to retry the Reddit fetch now or proceed with an alternative data-first version.

Additionally, if you want a quick starter, I can draft a concise “current-state” summary (without the day-by-day Reddit sentiment) to get you something actionable right away.
