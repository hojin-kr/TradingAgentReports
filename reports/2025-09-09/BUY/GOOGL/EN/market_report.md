Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull the required price data and stock stats indicators for GOOGL, but the data retrieval service returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) for Yahoo/CSV data, so I don’t have the actual numeric series to compute the indicators right now. I can proceed in two ways: (a) wait for the data service to be available and then deliver a full, data-driven, nuanced trend report, or (b) proceed with a clearly defined, ready-to-run indicator framework (8 indicators) so we’re prepared as soon as data comes in. I’ll outline option (b) now and can run the exact calculations the moment the data source is accessible.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, chosen for complementary insights without redundancy)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- vwma

Rationale and how these indicators complement each other for GOOGL
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - What it signals: medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why useful for GOOGL: Helps confirm the prevailing trend in a large-cap growth stock where medium-term cycles (earnings, AI news, regulatory events) can drive sustained moves.
- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - What it signals: long-term trend and major regime shifts (golden cross/ death cross when crossing with shorter SMAs).
  - Why useful for GOOGL: Aids strategic, multi-week to multi-month positioning; good context for risk-on/risk-off phases.
- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  - What it signals: short-term momentum and rapid shifts in price.
  - Why useful for GOOGL: Helps catch early entries/exits in a stock with frequent enthusiasm around tech headlines.
- macd (MACD line)
  - What it signals: momentum and potential trend changes via MACD crossovers.
  - Why useful for GOOGL: Works well with price trends in tech sectors where momentum can lead price moves; good to confirm with other indicators.
- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it signals: smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line indicate stronger momentum shifts.
  - Why useful for GOOGL: Adds a smoother confirmation layer to MACD signals, reducing false positives in choppy markets.
- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it signals: momentum strength and potential divergence early.
  - Why useful for GOOGL: Visual gauge of momentum acceleration/deceleration; helps detect waning momo before price falters.
- rsi (RSI)
  - What it signals: overbought/oversold conditions and momentum strength; potential divergence signals.
  - Why useful for GOOGL: In tech/growth stocks, RSI can stay extreme for longer during strong trends; use with trend context to avoid premature reversals.
- vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
  - What it signals: trend confirmation with volume support; price action in conjunction with volume.
  - Why useful for GOOGL: Large-cap liquidity and AI/news-driven moves often come with notable volume surges; VWMA helps validate persistent moves, not just price levels.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed, data-driven trend report that integrates the eight indicators above.
- For each indicator: current value, recent changes, alignment with other indicators, and inferred trend/momentum regime.
- Trading insights: potential entry/exit zones, trend confirmation, and risk controls (where to place stops, where to be cautious in low-volatility regimes, etc.).
- Specific scenarios (bullish, bearish, range-bound) and what the combination of indicators would imply in each case.
- A synthesis of signals into a concise framework you can use for decision-making.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval as soon as the data service is available, and then produce a full, numbers-backed report with the eight indicators.
- Alternatively, if you’re comfortable proceeding with a purely framework-driven analysis (no exact values until data is in), I can provide an initial qualitative interpretation guide using the same eight indicators and describe what you should look for in the current market regime for GOOGL.

Appendix: Key points at a glance (indicator roles)
- Trend direction: 50_sma, 200_sma, VWMA
- Short-term momentum: 10 EMA, MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram
- Momentum strength and reversals: RSI
- Volume support: VWMA

Markdown table: indicator roles and interpretations
| Indicator | Role | What to look for (interpretation) | How it helps with trading decisions for GOOGL |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend | Price above: uptrend; price below: downtrend; watch for cross with price | Confirms trend direction and potential dynamic support/resistance levels |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend | Price above: bullish regime; price below: bearish regime; look for golden/death cross with shorter SMA | Guides strategic positioning and risk exposure over weeks to months |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above: bullish momentum; price below: bearish momentum; quick cross signals | Helps time entries/exits in a volatile stock reacting to headlines |
| macd | Momentum/trend changes | MACD line cross above/below signal; rising/falling MACD | Signals potential trend changes to confirm with other indicators |
| macds | Smoother momentum signal | MACD Signal cross with MACD; histogram trends | Adds confirmation and filters false MACD cross signals |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Positive/negative histogram; divergence hints | Early warning of momentum exhaustion or acceleration |
| rsi | Momentum strength/overbought-oversold | RSI approaching/extreme levels (70/30) or diverging | Helps gauge potential reversals or continuation; use with trend context |
| vwma | Volume-supported trend | Price action with rising VWMA confirms trend; volume spikes validate moves | Distinguishes hollow moves from volume-backed advances; improves signal reliability |

Note: I’m ready to run the exact calculations and deliver the full data-driven report as soon as the data source becomes available. If you’d like me to proceed with the data retry now, say “retry,” and I’ll attempt again and generate the detailed analysis immediately after a successful fetch.
