I attempted to fetch the AAPL data for 2023-09-01 to 2025-09-09, but the data service returned an error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can retry fetching as soon as the data source is available. In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen, complementary set of indicators (8 in total) and a detailed plan for how to interpret them once the data is retrieved.

Selected indicators (8), with rationale
- close_50_sma
  - What it tells you: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s useful: Helps confirm trend when used with longer-term and shorter-term indicators; robust for filtering noise.
- close_200_sma
  - What it tells you: Long-term trend benchmark (golden/death cross context when combined with shorter SMAs).
  - Why it’s useful: Great for strategic trend confirmation and regime awareness; slow to react but highly informative for bias.
- close_10_ema
  - What it tells you: Short-term momentum and quick shifts in price action.
  - Why it’s useful: Responds faster than SMAs and can flag early entries, especially when aligned with longer-term trend signals.
- macd
  - What it tells you: Momentum via the difference between fast and slow EMAs; crossovers indicate potential trend changes.
  - Why it’s useful: Works well with trend-following rules and is effective when used with other filters in low-volatility or sideways markets.
- macds
  - What it tells you: MACD signal line; smoothing of MACD for cleaner cross signals.
  - Why it’s useful: Helps confirm MACD-based momentum shifts; reduces false positives from MACD alone.
- macdh
  - What it tells you: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence signals.
  - Why it’s useful: Visualizes how quickly momentum is accelerating or waning; adds nuance to MACD readings.
- rsi
  - What it tells you: Momentum magnitude and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - Why it’s useful: 70/30 framework is a staple for reversals; useful for spotting divergences when combined with trend context.
- atr
  - What it tells you: Market volatility (average true range) over the look-back window.
  - Why it’s useful: Crucial for risk management and position sizing; helps set stops and gauge regime shifts (high vs. low volatility environments).

Brief note on context (2023–2025, high level)
- Apple’s stock typically traded with strong price moves around product cycles and services revenue growth, but macro risk and market regime shifts can alter volatility and trend strength. The chosen indicators cover trend, momentum, and volatility to help adapt to varying regimes (trending, range-bound, and volatile periods).

What I would look for once data is available
- Trend confirmation: Price action relative to 50_sma and 200_sma
  - Bullish bias: Price above 50_sma and 200_sma; 50_sma trending upward; potential golden cross (if 50_sma crosses above 200_sma).
  - Bearish bias: Price below 50_sma and 200_sma; 50_sma crossing below 200_sma (death cross).
- Short-term momentum: 10_ema and MACD family signals
  - Entry signals: 10_ema crossing above price or aligning with MACD positive momentum (MACD line above signal and rising).
  - Caution: In choppy markets, rely on MACD histogram (macdh) strength and RSI levels to filter false moves.
- Momentum strength: MACD, macds, macdh
  - Bullish momentum: MACD line above zero and crossing upward; macds above the signal; macdh histogram widening positively.
  - Bearish momentum: MACD line below zero and/or crossing downward; macds below signal; macdh histogram widening negatively.
- Overbought/oversold context: RSI
  - Overbought (>70) may warn of pullbacks when trend is uncertain; oversold (<30) may indicate reversals in downtrends if price action supports bottoming.
  - Watch for RSI-divergence with price to anticipate reversals in both uptrends and downtrends.
- Volatility and risk management: ATR
  - Use ATR to size positions and place stops at a multiple of ATR to adapt to current volatility.
  - Higher ATR suggests wider stops and potentially larger drawdowns; lower ATR indicates tighter stops and lower required risk budget.

Trade considerations and scenario guidance (high level)
- If price is above 50_sma and 200_sma, RSI not in extreme overbought, MACD shows positive momentum, and ATR is rising moderately:
  - Favor long exposure or trend-following entries, with stops based on ATR-based levels.
- If price tests the 50_sma/200_sma region while MACD momentum wanes (macdh fading, macds near signal, RSI flattening near 50):
  - Be cautious on new longs; look for a clean breakout or a reversal signal before committing.
- If ATR spikes with price breaking out of a consolidation range:
  - Consider widening stops and reducing position size unless momentum indicators confirm a strong directional move.
- If RSI shows clear divergence with price in an uptrend, or MACD histogram diverges:
  - Consider hedging or waiting for a confirmatory price move before adding to positions.

Markdown table: key points at a glance
| Indicator | Insight Type | How to Use | Signals to Watch | Caveats |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| close_50_sma | Trend direction / dynamic support | Compare price to 50_sma; look for crossovers with price or with 200_sma | Price above 50_sma with rising slope; price crossing above 200_sma | Lagging indicator; use with faster signals for timing |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Assess overall regime; watch for interactions with 50_sma | Golden cross (50_sma above 200_sma) or price above 200_sma | Very lagging; best for strategic bias rather than entry timing |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Monitor quick shifts; confirm with longer-term signals | 10_ema crossing price or crossing above 50_sma; price above 10_ema | Prone to noise in choppy markets; filter with other signals |
| macd | Momentum trend changes | Use crossovers with MACD signal for entry/exit cues | MACD line above signal with rising MACD; MACD crossing zero to flip momentum | Requires corroboration in range-bound markets |
| macds | MACD signal smoothing | Confirm MACD moves; reduce false positives | macds crossing macd line; sustained moves with MACD momentum | Signal lag relative to price; use with histogram |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Visualize momentum shifts; watch for divergence | Macdh bars widening positively; negative widening indicates momentum fade | Can be volatile; combine with other filters |
| rsi | Momentum / overbought-oversold | Identify potential reversals, divergences | RSI >70 overbought; RSI <30 oversold; divergences with price | In strong trends RSI can remain extreme; use trend context |
| atr | Volatility / risk management | Set stops and adjust position sizes; gauge regime | Rising ATR indicates higher volatility; use as stop-loss basis | Reactive metric; should be paired with price action signals |

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data for AAPL as soon as the data service is available or if you’d like, I can adjust the date range (e.g., last 1 year, last 2 years) to fit the data access we have.
- If you want, I can proceed with a different set of up to 8 indicators (e.g., swap in boll and boll_ub/boll_lb for runoff signals) or tailor the mix to a specific trading style (intraday, swing, or long-term).

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or adjust the date range or indicator set?
