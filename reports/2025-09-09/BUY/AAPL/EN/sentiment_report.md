Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based stock news for AAPL on 2025-09-09, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). I can’t retrieve the Reddit/crowd sentiment data for that date right now.

Here are options to move forward, pick one or ask for a different approach:
- Retry now: I can re-run the Reddit stock info call immediately to see if the issue is transient.
- Try another date: I can pull Reddit sentiment/news for the closest available date (earlier or later) to 2025-09-09.
- Use alternative sources: I can compile a comprehensive sentiment/news analysis using other data sources (e.g., Twitter/X posts, major news headlines, earnings/industry context) and clearly note that Reddit data isn’t included for that window.
- Proceed with a qualitative framework: I can deliver a thorough, long-form analysis focusing on AAPL’s current state, typical sentiment drivers, and actionable takeaways for traders, with a transparent note about data gaps from Reddit for that date.

If you’d like, I can proceed with option 3 or 4 right away and provide:
- A detailed sentiment/news framework for AAPL over the past week (excluding Reddit if necessary).
- Key drivers and catalysts (product lifecycle, services growth, supply-chain/news, regulatory/regulation signals, AI-related hardware, competitive landscape).
- Risk factors and potential trade ideas (watch for product/earnings catalysts, sentiment spikes, options activity, and headline risk).
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, catalysts, sentiment direction, and trading implications.

Please tell me which option you prefer:
1) Retry Reddit data now
2) Use another date for Reddit data
3) Use alternative sources only (no Reddit)
4) Proceed with a full qualitative report based on available non-Reddit data

If you want the full qualitative report right away (without Reddit data for that date), I’ll proceed and include a clear note about the data gap.
