I attempted to fetch the required data for AAPL, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError for all requested tools. Specifically, the parallel tool wrapper failed to access the underlying data sources, so I can’t currently pull insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the latest balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now (preferable): I can try calling the tools again, first sequentially to isolate any single-tool issue, then in parallel if each call succeeds.
- Retry in sequence: Run each tool one by one to identify which one (if any) is causing the failure.
- Manual/qualitative route (less precise): I can provide a structured qualitative analysis of Apple (AAPL) based on publicly known fundamentals up to 2024, plus what traders typically look for, but I won’t have the exact 2025-09 figures or the latest insider data without the data feeds.

What I recommend:
- Let me retry the data fetch in sequence to confirm whether the error is transient or systemic. If successful, I will generate a comprehensive fundamental report with:
  - Company profile and basic financials (revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, EPS, etc.)
  - Balance sheet snapshot (assets, liabilities, equity, cash, debt, liquidity metrics)
  - Cash flow analysis (operating, investing, financing, free cash flow)
  - Insider sentiment (past 30 days) and insider transactions (past 30 days)
  - Trend analysis and fine-grained insights for traders (margin analysis, cash flow quality, liquidity health, leverage, share repurchase effects, etc.)
  - A concise, easy-to-scan Markdown table at the end summarizing key points

If you’d like me to proceed with retries, say “Retry sequentially,” and I’ll run the calls one by one and then assemble the report as soon as I have the data. If you’d prefer the qualitative route in the meantime, I can provide a detailed interpretation framework for AAPL’s fundamentals and typical trader takeaways, noting that it won’t include the latest 2025 data.
