Apologies — I ran into an internal data retrieval error trying to fetch NVDA data and indicators. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the price series or indicator values to generate a detailed trend analysis yet.

What happened and next steps
- Issue: Data retrieval failed for NVDA (2025-01-01 to 2025-09-09) and for each indicator call. This looks like an environment/tool availability problem rather than an issue with NVDA data itself.
- Immediate plan:
  1) Retry fetching the price data for NVDA for the same date range.
  2) If that still fails, try a shorter/alternative range (e.g., last 1 or 2 years) or a different ticker to verify the tool is working.
  3) Once data is successfully retrieved, I will compute up to 8 complementary indicators from your list (without redundancy) and produce a detailed, nuanced report on NVDA’s trend with actionable insights.
- Proposed 8-indicator set (complementary and non-redundant for NVDA):
  - close_50_sma
  - close_200_sma
  - close_10_ema
  - macd
  - macdh
  - rsi
  - boll
  - atr

Why this set is suitable
- Trend and cross-check: 50 SMA and 200 SMA help confirm medium- and long-term trend direction and potential support/resistance zones.
- Momentum: 10 EMA and MACD (plus MACD histogram) capture short-term momentum shifts and likely trend change signals in NVDA’s high-volatility environment.
- Momentum/oversold signals: RSI provides overbought/oversold context and potential reversals, especially when aligned or diverging from price trends.
- Volatility and risk: ATR quantifies current volatility to inform position sizing and stop placement.
- Volatility/price band context: Bollinger middle line (boll) gives a dynamic benchmark around which price often fluctuates, aiding breakout/reversion interpretation.

Request
- Do you want me to retry data retrieval now with NVDA (2025-01-01 to 2025-09-09), and if that fails, would you like me to adjust the date range (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-09-09) or try a shorter window (e.g., last 12 months) to confirm tool viability?

If you approve, I’ll run the fetch again and then deliver:
- A detailed, nuanced narrative of NVDA’s trend, including how each of the selected indicators aligns or conflicts.
- Practical trading considerations (entry/exit points, stops, risk checks) based on the combined indicator picture.
- A concluding Markdown table summarizing the key takeaways for quick reference.
