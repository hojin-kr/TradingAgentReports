Recommendation: HOLD NVDA

Rationale
- Long-term thesis intact: AI infrastructure demand, data-center expansion, and the CUDA/software ecosystem remain powerful tailwinds that support durable earnings power.
- Valuation and risk: NVDA commands a premium multiple; any softer AI capex cadence, policy/regulatory shifts (notably in China), or a data-gap-driven misread in momentum could compress near-term upside and multiple valuation.
- Moat and execution: CUDA ecosystem and software/licensing flywheel offer durable competitive advantages, but no moat is invincible. Regulatory and geopolitical risks remain meaningful.
- Data gap risk: With live price/indicator data unavailable, momentum signals are less reliable. A cautious stance helps protect against headline-driven volatility.

Actionable plan (practical steps)
1) If you already hold a large overweight position
- Trim exposure: reduce by 10–20% to lock in some gains and reduce convex downside exposure while data and catalysts remain uncertain.
- Reallocate proceeds: diversify into a broader AI/semi sleeve or cash to maintain optionality for future re-entry on clearer signals.
- Maintain risk controls: keep stops aligned to defined technical supports and ensure position sizing caps non-diversified risk (e.g., 8–12% of equity exposure per name, depending on your risk budget).
2) If you’re not long NVDA or are light
- Do not initiate a large long position now. If you add, do so in a phased, data-confirmed manner only after trend leadership returns (see trigger levels).
- Prefer diversified AI exposure over a single-name bet until trend clarity returns.
3) Risk management and hedges
- Use practical stop levels tied to a clear support zone (not just a percentage).
- Consider hedging if you’re exposed at higher weights or if a risk event looms (policy/reg headlines, licensing updates, competitive moves).
4) Catalysts and monitoring (over next 1–3 quarters)
- Licensing/regulatory developments (especially China) and hyperscaler capex commentary.
- Data-center demand cadence and any shifts in AI software/solutions revenue mix.
- Competitive dynamics and any material architecture/pricing changes.
5) Revisit triggers (when data returns)
- Revisit to Buy: durable breakout above resistance with volume plus confirmatory trend/momentum signals and manageable regulatory risk.
- Revisit to Sell/Reduce: licensing/regulatory headwinds or meaningful deceleration in hyperscaler capex; strong technical breakdown with momentum deterioration.
- Revisit to Hold: data remains inconclusive but no new negative catalysts emerge; maintain risk controls and wait for clearer trend.

Timeline
- Short term (1–2 weeks): Avoid aggressive new long-building; preserve capital, monitor for any acute headlines.
- Intermediate term (1–3 quarters): Reassess as data on data-center demand and licensing comes in; adjust stance as trend clarity improves.
- Long term (as data supports): If AI infrastructure growth proves durable and licensing/policy risk moderates, consider a measured re-accumulation with explicit targets and smaller initial allocations.

Lessons applied
- Avoid narrative overcommitment without trend confirmation; rely on data-driven triggers once data returns.
- Treat regulatory and policy risk as material; plan scenarios for licensing shifts.
- In data-gap intervals, emphasize diversification and risk controls rather than aggressive positioning.
