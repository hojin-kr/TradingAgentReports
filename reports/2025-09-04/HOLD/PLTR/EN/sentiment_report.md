Thanks for the nudge. I’m hitting an internal error with the stock-news tool (AttributeError: 'ResponseFunctionWebSearch' object has no attribute 'content') that prevents me from pulling the latest PLTR social sentiment and news data right now. I attempted retries, but the issue persists.

To keep moving, I can proceed with a default data window and data-collection plan, then deliver a thorough long-form report once the tool is accessible again. Please confirm if you’re happy with the following defaults, or tell me a different preference:

Default plan (if you agree)
- Date window: Aug 29, 2025 to Sep 4, 2025 (the 7 days ending on Sep 4, 2025)
- Platforms: public posts from X/Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, and public Facebook
- Language: English only
- Output format: CSV export (fields: date/time, platform, author, post_text, link, engagement metrics if available)
- Keywords/scope: PLTR, Palantir, Palantir Technologies (exclude unrelated mentions unless clearly relevant)
- Deliverables: a comprehensive long-form analysis with sentiment-by-day, notable news items, risk/cotential catalysts, and a trader-oriented wrap-up
- End product: a Makrdown (Markdown) table at the end organizing key points

What I will deliver (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: high-level sentiment trend over the week, notable sentiment spikes, and any obvious platform-driven divergences
- Daily sentiment breakdown: day-by-day sentiment distribution (positive/neutral/negative) with platform-specific notes
- Topic and driver analysis: dominant themes driving sentiment (product updates, government/contracts, partnerships, earnings/search interest, etc.)
- News integration: top news items about Palantir in the window and their potential sentiment impact
- Price/action context: how sentiment and news align with recent price moves, implied volatility, and risk factors
- Trader-oriented implications: actionable takeaways, catalysts to watch, and risk checks (e.g., regulatory headwinds, government contract news, competitive pressures)
- Risks and caveats: data gaps, noise in social sentiment, potential manipulation, and attribution limits
- Key takeaways: concise, decision-relevant conclusions
- Output table: a final Markdown table summarizing the core findings, ready to paste into a report

If you’d like a different window, platform set, or language filter, tell me and I’ll adjust.

In the meantime, to keep things moving, here’s a draft structure of the final report and a placeholder table you’ll see filled with data once the tool is accessible:

Draft report outline (structure you’ll get)
- Title: Palantir (PLTR) Social Sentiment and News Analysis — Week of Aug 29, 2025 to Sep 4, 2025
- Summary: high-level sentiment posture, major drivers, and potential catalysts
- Data methodology: sources, cleaning, sentiment scoring approach, and any limitations
- Daily sentiment narrative: one-paragraph read per day with notable posts or threads
- Platform-specific observations: key differences between X, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook
- News highlights: bullet points of the week’s top news items and quick sentiment read
- Implications for traders: what the data could imply for price action, volatility, and risk management
- Risks: data quality, noise, and external factors
- Conclusions: takeaways and watch list
- Appendix: raw data notes and links (CSV export-ready fields)
- Markdown table (Key findings) at the end

Provisional Markdown table layout (to be populated)
- Columns: Date, Platform, Theme/Topic, Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative), Post Snippet (short), Link, Engagement (if available)

Example rows (illustrative, not final)
- 2025-08-29, X/Twitter, Government contracts, Neutral, "Palantir signs new defense contract ..." , https://..., 12k
- 2025-08-30, Reddit, AI product updates, Positive, "Palantir’s new integration could boost enterprise adoption" , https://..., 8k
- 2025-09-01, TikTok, retail investor chatter, Negative, "PLTR hype vs. fundamentals" , https://..., 5k

Next steps
- Please confirm the default plan or provide your preferred adjustments.
- Once confirmed (or after you provide adjustments), I’ll retry data collection and deliver the full long-form report with the final Markdown table appended.

Apologies again for the hiccup. If you’d prefer, I can also switch to a fallback approach (e.g., summarize high-signal publicly available news items and provide a qualitative sentiment read based on historical patterns) while we wait for the tool to stabilize.
