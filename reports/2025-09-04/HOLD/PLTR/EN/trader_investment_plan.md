Assessment summary:
- The plan aligns with a cautious stance: near-term bear signals but a strong long-term thesis for PLTR. Entry should wait for clear re-acceleration.

Recommendation:
- Hold now. Buy only on confirmed re-acceleration above key resistance with bullish momentum.

Rationale:
- Technicals: MACD below zero and RSI ~42–50 range; price trading under short-term averages, testing the 50-SMA near 156. This suggests a pause/rollover rather than a new up-leg.
- Long-term drivers remain intact (gov/defense + AI exposure, international expansion), so exposure is justified on strength.
- Risk management: Valuation and rate/sentiment sensitivity remains a headwind; avoid premature entries to minimize whipsaws.

Strategic actions by scenario:
- If flat/no position:
  - Primary entry (confirmation): Buy on a close/ breakout above 159–160 with RSI > 50 and a bullish MACD turn (cross above signal ideally).
  - Volume should be above average.
  - Initial stop: around 149–150 (~1 ATR below the 156–160 zone).
  - Position sizing: risk 0.5%–1.0% of the account per trade.
  - upside targets: 165–170 (Tier 1), 175–180 (Tier 2) if momentum sustains.
- If already long:
  - Protect gains: place/adjust stop around 149–150.
  - Consider trimming 20%–30% into 159–160 resistance if momentum stalls.
  - Optional hedge: short-dated puts around 150 or a collar to define downside into confirmation.
- If tactically bearish (for traders only):
  - Short only on a break below 155–156 with RSI < 40 and deteriorating MACD; stop around 158.5–159; targets 150 then 145; keep size conservative given the uptrend on longer timeframes.

Execution checklist:
- Watch: MACD bullish cross and RSI rising above 50; price reclaim of the 50-SMA; volume confirming breakout.
- Key levels: 156 reclaim; 159–160 breakout; downside guardrails at 150 and 145.
- Fundamentals to monitor: new/expanded government contracts, ARR/margin trajectory, and progress in international channels; macro drivers like rates and AI sentiment.

Bottom line:
- Hold now; buy strength, not weakness. The long-term bull case remains credible, but the tape hasn’t turned yet. Let momentum confirm above 159–160 with RSI > 50 and a MACD turn, then scale in with disciplined risk.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
