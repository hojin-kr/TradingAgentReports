Decision: HOLD

Why (judge’s synthesis anchored in the debate)
- Momentum is objectively negative now. Safe: “The safest path… is to be patient and protect capital until there is a verified, durable change in momentum.” Data cited by all: MACD below zero and signal (histogram ~ -2.33), RSI ~42–43, price under the 10-EMA and below/retesting the 50-SMA (~156).
- Long-term thesis remains intact, but it doesn’t justify buying into a decelerating tape. Risky (agreeing with the core plan): “Core thesis: Hold now; buy strength, not weakness… confirm entry with a breakout above 159–160, RSI > 50, and MACD cross-turn, with above-average volume.”
- Balanced path avoids missing a real turn without front-running it. Neutral: “The long-term thesis… remains intact, but the near-term tape is fragile.” Their staged approach preserves upside while respecting current weakness.

Counterpoints weighed
- Risky warns about missing the “first leg,” but both Safe and Neutral highlight elevated ATR (≈7.6) and sub-50 RSI, which raise whipsaw risk if you’re early. The solution is a staged/confirmation-based plan rather than anticipatory buying.
- Valuation/macro risk isn’t a reason to sell the secular story, but it is a reason not to add until momentum confirms. Safe: “Macro-rate moves and AI-sector sentiment can swing fast and erase near-term gains.”

Verdict
- Hold is not fence-sitting here—it is the highest-probability, risk-adjusted call given unanimous momentum deterioration and agreement on confirmation triggers before adding.

Refined trading plan (starting from your original and tightening with the analysts’ insights)

Key refinements vs your original plan
- Lower near-term risk per trade to 0.25%–0.5% (from 0.5%–1.0%) while ATR is elevated.
- Make the MACD cross above signal a hard condition for full breakout adds.
- Offer a clearly defined “starter” only after a decisive 50-SMA reclaim, with small size and the same total-risk cap.

1) What to do now
- If flat: Do nothing yet. Prepare orders and alerts.
- If already long: Hold core. Protect with a stop/stop-zone around 149–150 on the trading sleeve; consider trimming 20%–30% into 159–160 if momentum fails to confirm.

2) When to buy (two-step triggers)
- Starter (optional, 1/3 size): On a decisive close back above the 50-SMA (≈156.2–156.5) with:
  - RSI > 45 and rising, and
  - MACD histogram improving (less negative two sessions in a row),
  - Above-average volume preferred.
- Full add/primary entry: On a close above 159–160 with:
  - RSI > 50,
  - MACD crossing above its signal (bullish turn),
  - Above-average volume.
- Position sizing: Risk 0.25%–0.5% of account per entry while ATR ~7–8. Keep total risk across staged entries within your single-trade risk cap.

3) Risk controls
- Initial stop: 149–150 (about 1 ATR below the 156–160 zone) or 1.0x ATR below your actual entry, whichever is tighter but not so tight that normal noise stops you out.
- If the breakout fails (close back below 156 with RSI < 45 and MACD deteriorating), exit the starter and wait for the next valid signal.
- If price closes below 149 with RSI < 40 and worsening MACD, reduce to core or step aside entirely; revisit near 145.

4) Upside management
- Tiered targets: 165–170 (first scale), 175–180 (second). Trail a stop under the 10-EMA once RSI > 55 and MACD is advancing to protect gains.

5) Optional options
- Get paid to wait: Sell cash-secured 150 puts 21–45 DTE when premium is acceptable; willingness to own at 150 required.
- On confirmation: Consider a defined-risk call spread (e.g., 160/175, 2–3 months) to participate with capped downside.

6) Tactical short only if breakdown
- Only on a decisive close below 155–156 with RSI < 40 and worsening MACD; stop ~158.5–159; targets 150 then 145. Keep size small given the higher-timeframe uptrend.

What we’re watching
- Momentum: MACD bullish cross + RSI > 50, price reclaiming the 50-SMA and 10-EMA on above-average volume.
- Levels: 156 reclaim; 159–160 breakout; 150 and 145 as downside guardrails.
- Fundamentals/macro: New government/commercial contracts and ARR/margins; rates/real yields and AI-sector risk appetite that affect multiples.

Summary of strongest debate points (for auditability)
- Bull/long-term: “Dual-engine growth (gov/defense + US commercial AI)… defensible platform moat (AIP)… long-term uptrend intact (well above 200-SMA).”
- Bear/near-term: “Momentum is objectively negative across MACD/RSI/EMA… valuation is vulnerable to rates/sentiment… ATR elevated, so whipsaws are costly if you’re early.”
- Consensus action signal: “Hold now; buy strength, not weakness,” with confirmation above 159–160, RSI > 50, MACD turning up, volume.

Lessons applied to avoid past mistakes
- Don’t buy into negative momentum: We require RSI > 50 and a MACD bull cross for the full entry.
- Control whipsaw risk in high ATR: Risk per trade cut to 0.25%–0.5%; stops set via ATR, not arbitrary dollars.
- Avoid oversized conviction before confirmation: Staged entries keep total risk bounded and reversible.
- Don’t ignore macro-rate sensitivity: We’ll gate larger adds if real yields spike and AI beta is risk-off, even if price pokes levels intraday.
- Commit to explicit invalidation: Close below 149 with weak momentum triggers de-risking to core or flat.

Bottom line
- Hold. Do not add until the tape proves a re-acceleration: close above 159–160 with RSI > 50, MACD cross up, and volume. Optional small starter only after a firm 50-SMA reclaim with improving momentum, using tight, ATR-aware risk. This captures the long-term upside while respecting the current, unanimously identified momentum deterioration.
