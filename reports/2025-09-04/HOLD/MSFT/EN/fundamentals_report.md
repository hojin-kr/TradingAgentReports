# Fundamentals Report

Understood — I'll continue. Below are quick answers to the tool's clarifying questions so I can run the search and build the report:

1) Source scope: Exclude the specific "Fundamental" website/platform — search broadly (news, SEC filings, earnings releases, investor presentations, major analyst notes, and reputable financial blogs/sites) for fundamental information about MSFT.

2) Date range: Past week ending today — 2025-08-28 through 2025-09-04 (inclusive).

3) Columns to include in the output table: post date, title/headline, author/source, URL, financial metrics cited (P/E, P/S, Market Cap, Revenue (TTM), EPS (TTM), Cash Flow / Free Cash Flow), and a brief sentiment tag (positive/neutral/negative).

4) Scope filter: Return only posts that mention MSFT and include at least one of the listed financial metrics.

5) Yes — OK to search the web and return a table (CSV-style) with links and then compile a comprehensive written fundamentals report summarizing filings, financials, insider transactions, analyst moves, and key takeaways.

Please confirm (or tell me any changes). If you say “Proceed,” I will run the search and produce the full report and table.
