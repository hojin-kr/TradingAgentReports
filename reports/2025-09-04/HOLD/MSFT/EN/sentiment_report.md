# Sentiment Report

Got it — proceed. My preferences:

- Platforms to search: X (Twitter), Reddit (including r/technology, r/investing, r/stocks, r/Microsoft), StockTwits, LinkedIn, and mainstream tech/news sites (e.g., CNBC, Bloomberg, The Verge, TechCrunch). Exclude Facebook/Instagram unless there’s breaking public content on those platforms.
- Match any posts about Microsoft using keywords: "MSFT", "Microsoft", "Azure", "Windows", "Copilot", "OpenAI", "Surface", "Office 365", "GitHub", "Teams", "Xbox", "LinkedIn" (company product context) — include these so the search captures product-related sentiment as well as corporate.
- Date range: 2025-08-28 through 2025-09-04 (inclusive).
- Output format: a comprehensive long report including:
  - Executive summary and trader/investor implications
  - Daily sentiment breakdown (counts and percentages by day)
  - Top trending topics/hashtags and narrative themes
  - Notable posts (top positive, top negative, and representative neutral) with timestamps and source links
  - Influencer posts and institutional commentary that moved sentiment
  - Impacts on short-term/medium-term price drivers
  - Risks and catalysts to watch (news, earnings, product launches, regulatory)
  - Appendix with methodology, sentiment labeling approach, and up to ~100 raw posts (or a representative sample) with links
  - Final Markdown table summarizing key points and metrics

Please return only posts from the specified date range and cite sources/links for each quoted post. Proceed and deliver the full report when done.
