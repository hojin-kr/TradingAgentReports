Thanks for the note. I ran into an internal error when attempting to fetch latest stock news for AAPL (and APPL). The tool returned an AttributeError related to the web search response object, so I couldn’t retrieve the latest headlines or sentiment data directly right now.

A couple of quick clarifications and options to keep us moving:
- Ticker check: APPL appears to be a typo. The correct ticker for Apple Inc. is AAPL. Do you want me to proceed with AAPL only?
- If you’re okay, I can retry the stock-news fetch as soon as the tool is available again. Alternatively, you can paste or share any headlines or posts you want me to analyze (e.g., links, headlines, or a list of social posts), and I’ll build the sentiment analysis and insights from that data.

What I can deliver in the meantime (a robust plan you’ll get once data is in):
- A comprehensive long-form report analyzing public sentiment from social media, forums, and news over the past week, focused on AAPL.
- Daily sentiment trend breakdown (positive/negative/neutral) with key drivers (product news, earnings chatter, supply chain, regulatory issues, macro factors).
- Thematic synthesis of social chatter (e.g., iPhone demand, ecosystem strength, services growth, AR/VR/product roadmap chatter) and how these themes map to potential trading implications.
- News tone and event context (headline-level analysis of notable news items that could move sentiment or price).
- Trader-focused implications: potential catalysts, risk/uncertainty points, and scenario-based trading considerations (e.g., on stronger/ weaker sentiment days).
- A final Markdown table organizing key points for easy reference.

What I need from you to finalize the report quickly:
- Confirm you want me to use AAPL (Apple) as the ticker, not APPL.
- If you have preferred sources (e.g., X/Twitter, Reddit, StockTwits, news outlets) or specific dates (past 7 days, or a custom window), tell me so I can tailor the data collection.
- If you already have headlines or posts handy, paste them here and I’ll analyze them immediately and deliver the full report with a table at the end.

Draft report outline I’ll produce once data is available (structure you’ll see in the final version):
- Executive snapshot: current sentiment posture and notable news over the past week; immediate implications for traders.
- Daily sentiment chart narrative: per-day sentiment polarity and notable spikes, with brief cause analysis.
- Thematic map: top themes driving sentiment (e.g., device demand, services growth, supply chain, regulatory/regulatory tech talk, ecosystem/brand strength).
- Newsheat: summary of major news items and their potential impact on price/action.
- Price-sentiment linkage: how sentiment days aligned with intraday/close moves and suspected catalysts.
- Risk and catalysts: potential swing factors over the next 1–2 weeks.
- Trading takeaways: actionable ideas (e.g., when sentiment pivots near key levels, what to watch for in price action).
- Appendices: data sources, methodology notes, and confidence notes.

Tentative Markdown table (structure to be filled after data is in)
- I will append a final table like this with actual data:
- Columns: Date, Source, Headline/Theme, Sentiment (P/N/U), Probable Impact on Price, Notable Catalyst, Example Price Move (intraday/close)

Table: Key points and snapshot (to be filled with data)
- Date
- Source
- Headline/Theme
- Sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
- Estimated Price Move Window (Intraday / Close)
- Catalyst or Driver
- Trader Takeaway

If you’d like, I can try to re-run the stock-news fetch immediately for AAPL once you confirm, and I’ll deliver the complete, trader-focused report with the Markdown table at the end.
