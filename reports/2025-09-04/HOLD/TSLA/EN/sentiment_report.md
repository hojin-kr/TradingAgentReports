# Sentiment Report

Got it — before I run the search I need a couple quick choices. I’ll suggest sensible defaults; please confirm or change any.

1) Date range
- Default: 2025-08-28 through 2025-09-04 inclusive (7 days). OK?

2) Social platforms to include
- Default: X/Twitter, Reddit (r/teslamotors, r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets), StockTwits, LinkedIn (public posts), and mainstream news sites. Include "all public sources" beyond those? (Facebook/Instagram public posts are lower-signal; I can include them if you want.)

3) Language / account filters
- Default: English-only, all accounts (including influencers and verified accounts). Want to restrict to verified accounts only or include non-English?

4) Output format and scope
- Default: Comprehensive long report with:
  - Summary of key themes and sentiment trends (daily sentiment breakdown)
  - Notable viral posts/tweets (sample with timestamps and links)
  - News headlines and implications
  - Trading implications and risk points
  - Final concise takeaways + a Markdown table summarizing key points
- OK, or do you want a CSV/JSON export of raw posts and sentiment as well?

Tell me any changes (or just say “Proceed with defaults”) and I’ll fetch the data and prepare the full report.
