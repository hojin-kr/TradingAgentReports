Sorry about that — I’m seeing an internal error from the fundamentals fetch tool when I try to pull AAPL data for 2025-09-04. I’ll retry, but if the issue persists I can switch to an alternative approach (see options below).

What would you like to do?
- Option 1: Retry now to fetch AAPL fundamentals for 2025-09-04 and generate the full report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option 2: Use an alternative approach and provide a qualitative/fundamental snapshot for Apple as of late Aug–early Sep 2025 based on public filings and news (with a detailed analysis and a summary table of key points).
- Option 3: If you have a specific data source or URL (platform of “Fundamental”), share it and I’ll compile the table from that source.

Additionally, to tailor the report, please confirm which metrics you want included. A common set is:
- Revenue
- Operating income / margin
- Net income / margin
- Earnings per share (GAAP and/or non-GAAP)
- Free cash flow
- Cash and cash equivalents
- Total debt
- Cash conversion and cash flow metrics (OCF, FCF)
- Valuation snapshots (P/E, P/S, P/B)
- Share count and buybacks
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (if available)
- Any per-share vs. company-level presentation you prefer

If you want me to proceed with Option 2 right away, I’ll pull a comprehensive fundamental overview for Apple (AAPL) covering the recent period and present:
- A narrative summary with fine-grained insights for traders
- A detailed breakdown of financials and trends
- A markdown table at the end organizing key points

Would you like me to retry the fetch now (Option 1) or proceed with Option 2?
