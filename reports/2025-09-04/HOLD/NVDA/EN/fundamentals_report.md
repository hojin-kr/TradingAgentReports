Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch NVDA fundamentals for the requested dates, but the data-fetch tool is currently returning an internal error (AttributeError related to a web-search component). I can’t reliably pull the week-by-week fundamentals right now.

Here’s how I can proceed—pick an option or suggest a blend, and I’ll execute:

- Option A: Retry the full week-long pull now
  - I’ll try the multi-date fetch (2025-09-01 to 2025-09-04 and nearby dates you requested) and return a detailed weekly report with a Markdown table at the end.

- Option B: Start with a single-day snapshot
  - I’ll fetch NVDA fundamentals for 2025-09-04 (the latest date in your window) and deliver a concise snapshot. Then I can iteratively add prior days as the tool becomes stable.

- Option C: General fundamentals fallback
  - If you’re okay with it, I can provide a high-level fundamentals snapshot for NVDA using standard public sources (revenue, earnings, margins, cash flow, leverage, etc.) as of the latest filings, without the per-day week-by-week granularity. Then we can build from there once the weekly fetch is working.

If you want the fullest version as initially planned, please say “Retry now (A)” and I’ll attempt the parallel-date fetch again and deliver a Markdown table with:
- Date
- Key fundamentals (e.g., P/E, P/S, cash flow metrics, ROE/ROIC, debt, revenue, net income)
- Any notes or data caveats
- Source links per date

Let me know which path you prefer. If you choose A, I’ll retry immediately and report back as soon as I have results.
