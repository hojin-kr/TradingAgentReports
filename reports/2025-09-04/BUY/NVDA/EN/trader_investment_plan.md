Evaluation summary:
- The plan favors a bullish, long-term view on NVDA driven by AI compute leadership and CUDA ecosystem moat, but emphasizes disciplined, confirmation-based entry to avoid near-term momentum risk.
- Current near-term action signals are cautious: price sits below key short-term moving averages (50SMA ~171.6, 10EMA ~176), RSI ~41, MACD histogram negative. This argues against indiscriminate dip-buying and supports waiting for a clean confirmation move.

Recommendation:
- Buy, but only through staged entries on confirmation. Do not chase strength; deploy capital as the market proves the uptrend via technical triggers.

Entry plan (flat or underweight):
- Entry Tranche 1: Buy 1/3 position on a daily close back above the 50SMA region (~171.6) with RSI > 45 and a rising MACD histogram (less negative than prior day). 
  - Stop for Tranche 1: daily close below 168 or a worsening MACD histogram beyond entry.
- Entry Tranche 2: Add 1/3 on a close above the 10EMA (~176) and the Bollinger middle (~178.9), with MACD histogram turning positive.
  - Stop for Tranche 2: close back below the 50SMA after reclaim, or a break of the prior swing low by more than 1 ATR.
- Entry Tranche 3: Add final 1/3 on a higher high above the 178.9–180 zone on expanding volume or a second consecutive positive MACD day.
  - Stop for Tranche 3: as above (below reclaimed 50SMA or swing low breach).

Risk controls and sizing:
- Total NVDA exposure: target 3–5% of portfolio, increasing only after confirmation.
- Individual tranche risk: 0.5–0.75% of portfolio.
- Hard guardrail: exit all exposure on a decisive break of the 200SMA (~139).

If already long:
- Maintain core position but refrain from adding until the confirmation sequence above is triggered.
- Risk trim if price stalls at the 171–176 band and shows deteriorating momentum (e.g., RSI slipping, MACD weakening) or closes below 165 with RSI < 40.
- Use a trailing stop (20-day EMA or 2x ATR) to protect gains if the uptrend resumes.

Rationale:
- The secular bull case (AI compute leadership, CUDA ecosystem, hyperscaler/enterprise AI spend) remains intact, but near-term momentum is fragile. The plan’s staged entries align with the need for architectural confirmation before sizing up, reducing the risk of premature exposure while preserving upside participation.

Note:
- This assessment follows the provided investment plan’s logic. No historical memory is carried over beyond preserving disciplined entry criteria and risk controls.
