I attempted to fetch NVDA news for 2025-09-04, but the news tool returned an internal error:

Error: AttributeError("'ResponseFunctionWebSearch' object has no attribute 'content'")

This looks like a bug in the helper tool (not in your request). I can try again now, but if the tool continues to fail, I’ll switch to a fallback plan.

What I can do next (choose one or both):
- Retry retrieving NVDA news for 2025-09-04 (and, if possible, pull a week-long window of headlines and summaries).
- Expand to pull sentiment signals and notable social media chatter from the past week once news data is available, then synthesize a trader-focused report.

If you’d like, I can proceed with the retry immediately and report back with a full long-form analysis once the data comes through. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the final report once I have the data:

Proposed report structure (to be filled with actual data):
- Executive summary: key sentiment mood and actionable takeaways for traders in the current week.
- News overview (past 7 days): major headlines, earnings/exec moves, supply chain, regulatory, and AI/tech sector context.
- Daily sentiment scan: day-by-day sentiment signals (positive/negative/neutral), top drivers (product launches, partnerships, guidance changes, etc.).
- Social media signal analysis: themes (e.g., AI compute demand, data center deployments, chip supply, pricing trends), influencer activity, and notable spikes or memes.
- Event-driven risk and opportunity: upcoming catalysts (product cycles, earnings, AI/compute demand shifts) and potential surprise risks.
- Technical context (brief): momentum cues, volatility considerations, and any obvious pattern signals related to NVDA’s stock price.
- Implications for traders:
  - Short-term: entry/exit pressure, risk management notes, potential headline catalysts.
  - Medium-term: thematic exposure (AI, data center, gaming, automotive) and inventory/supply-chain considerations.
- Key takeaways: concise bullets for quick decision-making.
- Append a MakrMarkdown-style table at the end that organizes key points (topic, data source, sentiment, potential impact, trader takeaway).

If you want me to proceed with the retry now, say “Retry now” and I’ll fetch the latest NVDA news and then generate the full report. If you prefer a different date window or a more focused angle (e.g., AI compute demand, supply chain risk, Nvidia’s datacenter business), tell me and I’ll tailor the analysis accordingly.
