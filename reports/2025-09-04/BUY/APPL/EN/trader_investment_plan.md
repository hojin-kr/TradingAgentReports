Recommendation: Buy AAPL with disciplined, risk-managed entries.

Rationale (concise)
- Bull thesis intact: Services growth, ecosystem moat, on-device AI/silicon advantages, and robust buybacks support durable cash flows and valuation.
- Technical posture constructive: Price trading above key moving averages, positive momentum indicators, and clearly defined levels for entry and risk.
- Manageable macro/regulatory risks: Rates, inflation, and regulatory scrutiny are real but monitorable; hedging helps protect against near-term catalysts.

Trade plan (summary of proactive, layered approach)
- Entry paths (choose 1–2 to implement, not all at once):
  - Pullback entry: Buy around 232 ± 1. Stop at 224.5 (about 1.5x ATR below). Initial target 246–248; secondary 255–260. Trail stop to ~2x ATR below the close once above 246.
  - Deeper value add: If touched, buy around 217 ± 1. Stop at 212. Initial targets 231–233, then 246.
  - Breakout entry: Buy on a confirmed close above 241.5 with volume > 1.5x 20-day avg. Stop 235.5. Targets 252, then 260.
- Risk sizing:
  - Risk per tranche: ~0.5% of portfolio.
  - Max total risk on AAPL: ~1.5% of portfolio.
  - Allocation: 4–6% total, split among tranches.
- Hedging:
  - Consider 1–2 month puts ~3–5% OTM to cover 30–50% of exposure.
  - For existing long > implement a collar (finance with a short-dated call) around catalysts.
- Risk management and exits:
  - If a new tranche’s stop is hit, reassess at next planned level.
  - If daily close < 231 without reclaim, reduce exposure; if close breaks 216–217 or 200SMA decisively, de-risk further.
- What to monitor:
  - Services momentum/margins, regulatory updates, China demand dynamics, supply-chain shifts.
  - Technical: 10-EMA near-term guide; 50SMA/200SMA as structural lines; watch for negative MACD on high volume.
  - Macro: CPI/PCE, Fed signals, USD moves; hedge ahead of prints.

Why this should work (learned framework)
- You’re participating in a proven uptrend in a high-quality cash generator while enforcing defined risk controls and optional hedges. You’re not betting on perfection; you’re layering exposure with disciplined thresholds. This framework addresses prior tendencies to chase breakouts or chase entries without protection.

Final action posture
- Place staggered buy orders at 232 and/or prepare a 241.5 breakout entry; implement corresponding stops (224.5 for the 232 entry, 235.5 for the breakout). Consider a smaller add near 217 if offered. Hedge with near-term puts to cap downside.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
