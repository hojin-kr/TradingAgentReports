# Sentiment Report — instructions & confirmation

Thanks. I’ve cleaned and clarified your request below so we have a single, precise brief to execute. Please confirm or correct any details, and tell me how you want me to obtain the source posts (see last section).

## Search scope
- Platforms: X (Twitter), Reddit (including r/technology, r/investing, r/stocks, r/Microsoft), StockTwits, LinkedIn, and mainstream tech/news sites (examples: CNBC, Bloomberg, The Verge, TechCrunch).  
  - Exclude Facebook and Instagram unless there is breaking public content on those platforms that you explicitly want included.

## Keywords to match (include product context)
- MSFT, Microsoft, Azure, Windows, Copilot, OpenAI, Surface, Office 365, GitHub, Teams, Xbox, LinkedIn

## Date range
- 2025-08-28 through 2025-09-04 (inclusive)

## Required deliverables (full report, Markdown)
1. Executive summary and trader/investor implications  
2. Daily sentiment breakdown (counts and percentages by day)  
3. Top trending topics/hashtags and narrative themes  
4. Notable posts: top positive, top negative, and representative neutral — each with timestamp and source link  
5. Influencer posts and institutional commentary that moved sentiment  
6. Impacts on short-term and medium-term price drivers  
7. Risks and catalysts to watch (news, earnings, product launches, regulatory)  
8. Appendix:
   - Methodology and sentiment-labeling approach
   - Up to ~100 raw posts (or a representative sample) with links — all within the specified date range  
9. Final Markdown table summarizing key points and metrics

Additional instructions:
- Return only posts from the specified date range and cite sources/links for each quoted post.
- Preserve headings, bullets, numbers, tickers, and dates.
- Keep language in English.
- Deliver the full report in one Markdown document.

## Confirmation & data-access options
Before I begin assembling the report, please confirm which of these you prefer for data collection:
- Option A — I collect posts directly from the web/APIs (you confirm I may access live public sources). Note: indicate if you have API keys or specific endpoints you want me to use.
- Option B — You upload a dataset (CSV/JSON/links) of posts for the date range and I analyze and produce the report from that dataset.
- Option C — A hybrid: you provide proprietary/internal data and I supplement it with public sources you approve.

Also confirm:
- Any additional platforms or subreddits to include or exclude beyond those listed?
- Any particular influencers, institutional accounts, or news outlets that must be prioritized?
- Desired timezone for timestamps (UTC, ET, PT, etc.) and preferred time format.

Once you confirm choices above and provide access or files as needed, I will proceed to compile the full report per your specified format.
