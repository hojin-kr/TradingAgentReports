# Fundamentals Report

Sorry — I tried to fetch the live fundamentals with the provided tool but it raised an internal error and couldn’t return data. I can proceed in one of three ways — please tell me which you prefer:

Options
1) Retry the live fetch now (I can attempt again). Note: I already made two attempts and the tool errored; a retry may fail but I’ll try.
2) Proceed immediately with a comprehensive fundamental report using my available knowledge (cutoff 2024-06) and a clear checklist of the specific live data points you should add/confirm for 2024-06 → 2025-09-04. I’ll mark any items that are likely changed since my cutoff.
3) You upload the latest filings/press releases/insider transaction screenshots or paste key figures (latest 10-Q/10-K, most recent earnings release, delivery numbers, Form 4s) and I’ll synthesize them into the requested report.

If you want option 2 now, I’ll deliver:
- Full company profile and business model summary for TSLA
- Historical financials and key ratios (through 2024-06 where available), with interpretation
- Recent structural/strategic items to watch (FSD, price strategy, Shanghai/Gigafactory, energy & storage, Robotaxi program)
- Insider sentiment and what to look for in insider transactions
- Specific, actionable items traders should monitor this week (earnings, delivery reports, filings, analyst revisions)
- A final Markdown table summarizing the key points and recommended data to update

Which option do you want? If you choose retry (1), I’ll attempt the tool again immediately. If you choose 2, I’ll start the report right away. If you choose 3, please upload or paste the documents/screenshots.
