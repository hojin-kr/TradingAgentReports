# Trader Investment Plan

Short answer: Follow the proposed plan and reduce exposure now — SELL (trim to a smaller core holding and hedge the remainder). The near‑term evidence (confirmed China price cuts, European weakness, fragile short‑term technicals) creates more downside probability than upside until concrete margin/delivery stabilization or a clean technical reclaim. FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**

Actionable steps (execute immediately)
- Size: If you are currently 100% long TSLA, sell 40–60% of your position now (I prefer 50%). If your position is smaller (<2% portfolio), sell ~25–50% depending on risk tolerance.
- Hedge remaining position: buy a 3–6 month put spread to protect downside while financing cost.
  - Example structure: Buy 320 put, sell 280 put (adjust strikes to available chains and your remaining exposure). Size the spread to cover the delta-equivalent of the retained shares.
- If you prefer collars instead of put spreads: sell a near‑dated covered call (e.g., 1–3 month strike ~$360–380 depending on IV) and buy a 3–6 month 320 put.

Trade management rules and stops
- Immediate stop for remaining unhedged shares: tighten risk — if you hold any unhedged shares, set a stop ~1×ATR (~$12) under your entry or under the 200‑SMA support (~$318–320 if you intend to use $330 support).
- Short/active bearish trades: use put spreads only (no naked shorts). Trigger a new bearish spread if daily close <200‑SMA (~$330) on expanding volume and MACD histogram stays negative. Targets: $323 (50‑SMA), then $300, then $275. Place profit-taking in tranches.
- Hedge roll/upgrade: if price breaks <200‑SMA with heavy volume, widen and/or roll the protective put spread lower (e.g., buy 300/260) and consider selling another 20–25% of the original position.

Re‑entry rules (strict, event‑driven)
- Only rebuild longs on BOTH technical and fundamental confirmation:
  - Technical: daily close >10‑EMA/VWMA (~>$337) on expanding volume plus MACD histogram turning sustainably positive and a subsequent higher high above the prior swing ($351–363).
  - Fundamental: clear signs of MoM stabilization in China deliveries/ASPs (no additional price cuts), improving margin commentary, or visible improvement in FSD/subscription unit economics.
- If those conditions are met, redeploy proceeds in tranches (e.g., 25% then 25%) with ATR-based trailing stops.

Risk management & sizing
- Per‑trade risk: limit to 1–2% of portfolio on any directional trade.
- Use ATR to size stops and position sizing. With ATR ≈ $12: set long stops roughly 1×ATR under support; short stops can be 1.5×ATR above entry or a reclaim above $337 on volume.

Monitoring checklist (daily/weekly)
- Daily: price vs 10‑EMA/VWMA (~$336–337) and 200‑SMA (~$330), volume on closes, MACD histogram, ATR and IV shifts.
- Weekly: China deliveries/ASP commentary, European registrations, any new price cuts or incentives, FSD subscriber/revenue signs, supplier/battery cost commentary.
- Immediate action triggers:
  - Add hedges / trim more if: daily close <200‑SMA on expanding volume and negative fundamental news (new price cuts/guidance).
  - Reduce short/hedge positions if: reclaim >VWMA/10‑EMA on volume and improving fundamental datapoints.

Rationale in one line
Concrete near‑term margin pressure + fragile short‑term technicals = asymmetry favors trimming/hedging now; keep a small core only if you accept high volatility and optionality risk.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
