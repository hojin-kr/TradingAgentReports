I ran the Reddit sentiment data fetch for QQQ over the requested dates, but I’m hitting a system error (FileNotFoundError) from the tool. I also retried for 2025-10-18 and got the same error. So I don’t currently have Reddit sentiment data to analyze for this week.

How would you like to proceed?
- Retry now: I can try again immediately, either
  - sequentially (one date at a time) to isolate the failure, or
  - in a new parallel batch to see if the issue resolves.
- Use an alternative approach: I can proceed with a high-quality qualitative analysis based on recent news and public sentiment signals from other sources I can access, and clearly flag that Reddit data is unavailable this cycle.
- Wait and I’ll continue attempting to fetch Reddit data until successful, and then compile the full report.

Plan for the final long report (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: What the week’s sentiment says about QQQ (the ETF tracking the NASDAQ-100), and how retail traders vs. institutions appear to be positioned.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: Bullish, bearish, and neutral counts per day; top recurring themes per day (AI hype, tech earnings, macro headlines, rate expectations, etc.).
- Top themes and posts: Extract and summarize the most influential topics driving sentiment (e.g., megacap tech momentum, semi exposure, AI deployment chatter).
- News and macro alignment: Correlate sentiment with any notable company/sector news and macro events (earnings, Fed commentary, inflation data, geopolitical headlines).
- Implications for traders:
  - Short-term moves: If sentiment spikes bullish around AI/tech catalysts, potential squeezes or volatility windows.
  - Medium-term positioning: ETF flows, sector rotation signals, risk-on vs. risk-off shifts.
  - Risk factors: Sentiment fatigue, regulatory/tech regulations, macro risk.
- Data-backed insights: Quantified sentiment scores, daily themes, and actionable takeaways for entries/exits or hedging.
- Limitations: Note missing Reddit data for the week and any implications for interpretation.

Proposed final deliverable structure (with a Markdown table at the end)
- A detailed narrative analysis (spotting signals, conflicts, and nuance)
- A daily sentiment appendix (per date)
- A summarized verdict for traders
- Makrdown table example (to be updated once data is in)

Example table skeleton (to be populated after data returns)

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry Reddit data fetch now (specify sequential vs. parallel preference), or
- Proceed with the plan using alternative sources for sentiment/news, and I’ll note Reddit data as unavailable for this cycle.
