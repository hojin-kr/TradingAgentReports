I attempted to fetch Reddit stock news for GOOGL on 2025-10-18, but I hit an internal error: FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory. It looks like the Reddit data source isn’t accessible in this environment right now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can try the Reddit data fetch again immediately.
- Use an alternative approach: I can proceed with a comprehensive long-form analysis based on public company news and general sentiment from other sources (press releases, earnings coverage, major tech news, regulatory/compliance context) for the past week, and clearly label data that would have come from Reddit if available.
- Collect once more later: I can wait and retry if you’d prefer to pause before attempting again.

If you’d like me to continue now, please confirm which path you want:
1) Retry Reddit data fetch now.
2) Proceed with a broader sentiment/news analysis without Reddit data (I’ll still aim for a thorough, trader-oriented report and include a Markdown table at the end).
3) Try a different date for the Reddit feed (e.g., 2025-10-17 or another recent day) if you think that would help.

Note: I can still prepare the long report and traders’ implications once you choose the path. The current date is 2025-10-18, and the company is Alphabet (GOOGL).
