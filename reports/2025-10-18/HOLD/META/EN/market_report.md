I’m seeing an issue fetching the data for META from the data source right now (FileNotFoundError). I can’t pull the actual price history and indicator values at the moment. I’ll provide a robust indicator plan and a detailed, actionable interpretation framework you can use as soon as the data fetch succeeds. If you’d like, I can retry fetching data immediately or proceed with a qualitative, data-free scenario analysis in the meantime.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale for the chosen indicators
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for identifying the prevailing trend in META’s mid-cycle performance (e.g., ad demand cycles, product launches).
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm the overarching market regime (bullish, bearish, or sideways) and flags major trend shifts like golden/death cross setups.
- close_10_ema: Quick momentum gauge. Captures short-term shifts in price action, helpful around earnings releases or AI-driven news when moves can be fast.
- macd: Core momentum indicator. Crossovers and centerline behavior help signal shifts in momentum that may precede price moves.
- macdh: Momentum strength (MACD histogram). Complements macd by indicating the strength and speed of momentum changes, useful for avoiding early entries in choppy markets.
- rsi: Momentum/overbought-oversold context. Complements price trend with momentum extremes; watch for divergences in META given sentiment and ad-market cycles.
- atr: Volatility metric. Essential for risk management, position sizing, and adjusting stops in reaction to earnings volatility or macro headlines.
- vwma: Volume-confirmed trend. Helps validate price moves with volume, which is valuable for META where large moves often come with outsized participation during product/news events.

Very detailed, nuanced framework (no actual values available yet)
- Trend interpretation (price above/below moving averages)
  - If price trades above both 50SMA and 200SMA with the 50SMA rising toward the 200SMA, the medium- to long-term trend is improving. Look for MACD to be positive and rising, and RSI to trend higher but not in overbought territory.
  - If price remains below both SMAs or the 50SMA is below the 200SMA and trending down, the trend is bearish or weakening. MACD should be negative or deteriorating, RSI may drift lower toward the 30–40 range, and ATR could be elevated if volatility is increasing due to negative catalysts.
- Short-term momentum vs. longer-term trend
  - A bullish signal might occur when close_10_ema crosses above price with the MACD line crossing above zero and the MACD histogram turning positive (macd positive, macdh increasing). This is more persuasive if VWMA aligns with price (volume confirming the move).
  - In choppy markets, the MACD histogram (macdh) can oscillate without a clear trend; rely more on RSI (not overbought) and price staying above established support levels (50SMA or trendline) to avoid false entries.
- Momentum strength and timing
  - RSI in an uptrend often rises but should not reach extreme overbought levels (above 70) without price confirmation. Look for bullish RSI divergence only if price makes higher highs but RSI fails to do so, which can precede a pullback—use ATR to gauge if pullbacks are likely shallow or deep.
  - A rising macdh with a rising MACD line and a broadening histogram indicates strengthening momentum, often accompanied by higher VWMA readings if volume participates.
- Volatility and risk management
  - A rising ATR signals higher expected move magnitude; use this to widen stops or adjust position size to manage risk in META, especially around earnings or regulatory headlines.
  - If ATR spikes while price breaks above a key resistance (e.g., around 50SMA or a swing high) with VWMA confirming volume, it can signal a genuine breakout; otherwise, it might be a false breakout in a high-volatility environment.
- Volume confirmation
  - VWMA rising in tandem with price reinforces a sustainable move; if price pushes higher but VWMA declines or remains flat, be cautious about continuation, and consider tighter risk controls.
- Scenario-driven implications for entries/exits
  - Bullish setup: Price above 50SMA and 200SMA, MACD positive with rising hist, RSI climbing toward 60–70, VWMA rising on strong volume, ATR indicating moderate volatility. Enter on a pullback test to the 50SMA/previous resistance-turned-support, with a stop below the 50SMA or a recent swing low.
  - Neutral/sideways setup: Price oscillating around SMAs, MACD near zero or flat, RSI wandering, ATR relatively cool, VWMA flat. Favor ranges-based entries near support/resistance with tight stops and smaller position sizes.
  - Bearish setup: Price below both SMAs, MACD negative with deteriorating hist, RSI trending down toward 30–40, ATR elevated on negative news, VWMA declining. Consider short entries only on clear breakdowns below support with stops above recent highs and risk controls.
- Important caveats for META
  - META tends to react to ad market dynamics, regulatory/regulatory tech policy headlines, AI advertising competition, and large product updates. A confluence of MACD weakness, RSI failures to maintain momentum, and rising ATR around such events is a strong warning for risk management rather than a signal to add exposure.
  - Volume can spike on earnings or major product announcements; use VWMA to distinguish genuine participation from algorithmic or rumor-driven moves.

Next steps (when data retrieval succeeds)
- Compute the 8 indicators on META for the requested window (2024-10-18 to 2025-10-18).
- Generate a structured analysis summarizing:
  - Current trend (position relative to 50SMA/200SMA)
  - Momentum signals (MACD, macd histogram, RSI)
  - Volatility signal (ATR)
  - Volume-confirmed movement (VWMA)
  - Key resistance/support interactions (where price met or broke through)
  - Any divergences (RSI vs. price, MACD vs. price)
  - Suggested actions (entry, add-on, or risk-managed exit) with rationale
- Deliver an organized Markdown table with the interpretation points and suggested thresholds.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation (ready to populate once data is available)
- Indicator | What it Measures | How to Interpret for META | Trade Implications
- close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Interpret relative to price; trending above implies bullish context; crossing below may signal caution | Consider trend-following entries or risk-reductions around pulls to 50SMA
- close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above suggests longer-term bullish regime; below suggests bearish regime | Use for strategic bias; avoid premature entries against the primary trend
- close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick momentum shifts; can precede price moves | Entry on pullbacks toward the EMA with confluence from other signals
- macd | Momentum trend changes | Positive/negative momentum crossovers; sustained positive suggests uptrend | Use in combination with price position relative to SMAs
- macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram expansion indicates strengthening momentum; contraction signals weakening momentum | Use to confirm MACD signals and avoid false entries in volatile regimes
- rsi | Momentum and overbought/oversold context | Rising toward 60–70 with uptrend; potential pullback near or above 70; divergence signals | Use with trend; avoid chasing overbought extremes without price confirmation
- atr | Volatility level | Higher ATR means larger expected moves; adjust stops and sizing accordingly | Widen stops around high-volatility events; avoid placing risk per trade that’s too tight in volatile times
- vwma | Volume-confirmed price action | Moves accompanied by rising VWMA are more reliable | Favor entries aligned with rising VWMA, especially on breakouts or tests of resistance

Apologies again for the data fetch issue. I can retry fetching META data immediately or proceed with a qualitative, scenario-based analysis now if you’d like. If you’re ready, tell me whether I should retry the data pull right away or continue with this framework and keep you updated as soon as the numbers come through.
