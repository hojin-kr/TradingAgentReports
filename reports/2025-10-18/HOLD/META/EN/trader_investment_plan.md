After reviewing the proposed META plan, the prudent stance remains Hold. The bull case for long-term AI monetization is real, but near-term headwinds (capex drag, regulatory/privacy risk, and valuation premium) create a balanced risk-reward. A Hold keeps exposure intact while we watch for clearer monetization milestones and margin improvement.

Key rationale
- Pros for Hold: upside potential from AI-enabled monetization, data-center cost discipline, ecosystem synergies, and near-term catalysts around ROAS and ARPU improvements.
- Cons for Hold: near-term margin pressure from capex, uncertain ROAS payoffs, regulatory/privacy risk, and valuation that can compress if hard near-term catalysts don’t materialize.

Operational guidance
- Risk controls: keep position size aligned with your risk budget; implement clear stops around recent support levels and use ATR-based sizing to avoid volatility trap scenarios.
- Triggers to upgrade to Buy: sustained, verifiable ROAS uplift across multiple ad formats, plus meaningful data-center utilization improvements that translate into margin expansion.
- Triggers to downgrade to Sell: ROAS remains flat or deteriorates, capex/working-capital dynamics worsen beyond expectations, or regulatory risk intensifies materially.

What to monitor (and why it matters)
- Near-term monetization milestones (ROAS, ARPU by format, Reels/shopping monetization progress)
- Data-center progress (El Paso, Louisiana) and unit economics
- Regulatory/privacy developments affecting targeting/measures
- Earnings guidance and ad-demand signals

Portfolio actions you can consider today
- If currently over-allocated to META, rebalance toward a more modest, risk-aligned exposure with defined stop levels.
- If you’re establishing a position, wait for a pullback toward defined support with constructive technical signals before initiating or topping up, unless your risk budget allows a longer horizon.

Final decision
- HOLD META now. Maintain exposure with disciplined risk controls and explicit catalysts to watch. Upgrade to Buy only on clear, near-term ROAS uplift and sustainable margin expansion; downgrade to Sell if ROAS stagnates or capex/regulatory risks deteriorate.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
