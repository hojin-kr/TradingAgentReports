# Investment Report: META
## Executive Summary
META runs Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, mainly through ads. Near-term spending and privacy rules create risk, but long-term AI-driven monetization could lift profits. Hold with medium confidence.

## Investment Decision
Hold â€” Medium confidence

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term challenges: Big spending now may keep margins under pressure; regulatory/privacy rules could slow ad targeting and revenue growth.
- Long-term potential: AI-driven monetization could raise ad effectiveness and user value; data-center expansion and in-house AI tools help lower costs and expand opportunities across apps.
- Timing and valuation: The stock is priced for upside but near-term progress is not guaranteed, so patience and proof of early monetization gains are important.

## Risks To Watch
- Privacy and regulatory changes that limit ad targeting and measurement.
- Capital spending delays or higher costs that keep margins restrained in the near term.
- Competition from TikTok and other platforms reducing ad demand.
- Slower-than-expected improvements in ad monetization (ARPU/ROAS) and data-center economics.
