Thanks for the patience. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit-based sentiment/news for SPY (ticker SPY, date 2025-10-18) using the get_reddit_stock_info tool, but it returned a FileNotFoundError from the underlying data source. It looks like an internal tool issue rather than a user error.

What I can do next (choose one):
- Retry now: I can attempt again to fetch the Reddit/news data for SPY in a moment to see if the internal error resolves.
- Proceed with a qualitative analysis: I can provide a detailed SPY sentiment and macro-news framework based on typical drivers (macro macro: rate expectations, inflation data, GDP, geopolitics; ETF-specific flows and liquidity; risk-on/risk-off sentiment; technical levels). This would be a best-effort synthesis without the Reddit feed, and I’ll clearly note where data is unavailable.
- Use alternative sources: If you have another data source you want me to pull from (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, financial news headlines, or a different subreddit), I can tailor the search to that and integrate it into the report.

Please tell me which option you’d prefer. If you want me to retry the Reddit feed now, I’ll do that and report back with the latest results.
