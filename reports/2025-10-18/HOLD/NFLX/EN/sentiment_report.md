I attempted to fetch NFLX Reddit sentiment/news for 2025-10-18, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError and isn’t delivering data right now. I can’t pull Reddit data at the moment.

How would you like to proceed?
- Retry now: I can try the Reddit data fetch again immediately and then build the full report with sentiment, news, and implications.
- Proceed with non-Reddit sources: I can generate a detailed long-form report using available public news, official company updates, and broader social sentiment (Twitter/X, stock forums, etc.) and clearly note the sources and limitations. We can add Reddit data later once the tool is working.
- Draft the report skeleton: I can lay out the full structure of the report with placeholders for sentiment scores and key points, so once data is accessible we can fill in the details quickly. This would include a Markdown table at the end as requested.

If you have a preference, let me know and I’ll proceed accordingly.
