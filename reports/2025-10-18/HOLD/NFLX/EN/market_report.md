I attempted to fetch NFLX data and run the selected indicators, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This looks like an environment issue on the data side rather than with your ticker. Here’s what I can do next:

- Retry data retrieval now (or at a specific time you prefer).
- If you’d like, adjust the date window (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31) or shorten to a recent look-back (e.g., last 365 days) to improve the chance of success.
- Once data is retrieved, run the 8 selected indicators and deliver a detailed, nuanced report with a final organized table.

Recommended indicator set (up to 8, curated for complementary insight on NFLX):
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; helps identify the mid-term trend.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend confirmation and classic trend-cross reference (golden/death cross).
- close_10_ema: 10-day EMA. Responsive momentum shifts; can highlight early entry or pullback points in conjunction with longer-term filters.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum and potential trend change cues; useful with other filters in choppier markets.
- macds: MACD Signal. Smoothing of MACD; MACD crossing this line can signal entry/exit when aligned with other signs.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength and divergence insights; helps gauge acceleration or weakening momentum.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; watch for divergences with price/trend.
- atr: ATR. Volatility gauge used to adjust risk management (stop placement and position sizing) given current volatility.

Rationale for these 8:
- They cover trend (50/200 SMA), momentum (10 EMA + MACD family + RSI), and volatility risk (ATR) without overlapping too heavily.
- Excludes Bollinger bands and VWMA in order to keep the set focused on price- and momentum-based signals and a volatility filter, which tends to be particularly useful for a high-variance stock like NFLX.

What you’ll get after data is retrieved:
- A detailed, nuanced narrative describing:
  - The price relationship relative to 50 SMA and 200 SMA (trend context, potential support/resistance zones, cross signals if any).
  - Short-term momentum signals from the 10 EMA in conjunction with MACD line/signal/histogram behavior (crossovers, momentum divergence, histogram trends).
  - RSI readings with potential divergences and overbought/oversold context, in the frame of the current trend.
  - ATR-driven risk considerations (how current volatility affects stop placement and position sizing).
- A concise “Read this for trading decisions” section with trade-entry/exit considerations framed by the indicators’ signals, plus caveats for false positives in low-volatility or high-noise periods.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key signals, current readings, and suggested actions for quick reference.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry fetching NFLX data now, using the same date window, or
2) Adjust the date window (please specify new start/end dates) and then proceed?

If you approve, I’ll run the data pull and indicators and deliver the full, detailed report with the organizing Markdown table as soon as the data is available.
