Assessment summary:
- Recommendation: Hold PLTR for now.
- Rationale: The bull case points to enterprise cross-sell potential, Snowflake/AI momentum, and international expansion, but those catalysts have not yet produced sustained ARR growth or meaningful margin expansion across a broad customer base. The bear case highlights government exposure, execution risk, and valuation sensitivity. Given the balance of risks and the need for more durable, data-confirmed progress, a cautious stance is warranted.

What would upgrade to Buy look like (data-driven triggers):
- ARR growth acceleration across at least two non-government verticals and one international geography, with visible cross-sell velocity.
- Sustained gross-margin improvement tied to platform monetization, not one-off mix shifts.
- Higher net dollar retention with rising add-on revenue per customer.
- Confirmed price-action signal: price trades above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, MACD positive with a widening histogram, RSI in constructive zone, and controlled ATR indicating manageable risk.
- Clear, repeatable cross-sell playbooks and durable renewals across multiple geographies.

Current plan posture and actions:
- For holders: maintain risk controls, reduce exposure toward neutral if overweight, tighten stops, and hedge around key catalysts (earnings/regulatory events). Consider building a watch position and scaling in only on multi-quarter ARR acceleration with margin improvement.
- For non-holders: avoid large new allocations now. If a starter position is taken, ensure explicit data-driven triggers are met and implement a staged entry with predefined stops and a plan to scale up only if alignment persists for 4–6 weeks.

Risk controls and monitoring:
- Use ATR/dollar-based stops to cap downside (e.g., 5–8% per entry module, adjusted for risk budget).
- Consider modest hedges around catalysts (protective puts or a collar) to manage tail risk without capping upside.
- Schedule frequent reviews around earnings and regulatory updates; re-run the 8-indicator framework and compare to the thesis.

Lessons applied:
- Avoid dependence on a single catalyst; ensure broad-based, repeatable revenue growth and margin leverage before increasing exposure.
- Require economic proof of the governance moat via pricing power, renewals, and unit economics per customer.
- Prioritize observable metrics (ARR, gross margins, retention, geographic mix) over headlines and sentiment.
- Maintain discipline with risk controls, hedging, and staged entries to manage headline or catalyst risk.

If you want, I can translate this into a live, stepwise execution plan with concrete trigger thresholds and a catalyst calendar, and tailor it to your current portfolio and risk tolerance.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
