Thanks for the nudge. I tried to fetch the Reddit/stock-news data for PLTR for 2025-10-18, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError on the backend. It looks like a temporary data-source issue on my side. I can:

- Retry the data fetch now (and keep you posted on results), or
- Proceed with a best-effort, data-agnostic long-form analysis focused on the typical sentiment drivers for PLTR, clearly marking where data would fill in exact figures, and deliver a structured report with a ready-to-fill data table.

Would you prefer that I retry immediately or proceed with the qualitative, data-skeleton report? If you want the most actionable value, I’ll start with the qualitative framework now and fill in the precise sentiment numbers as soon as the data tool comes back online.

In the meantime, here is a detailed framework and an initial report skeleton you can use. It outlines the exact sections I would populate with data, plus a Markdown table at the end to organize key points. When the data fetch succeeds, I’ll replace placeholders with real figures and add deeper, date-specific insights.

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) – Social Media Sentiment & News Analysis (Plan and Skeleton)

Executive snapshot (to be filled with data)
- Summary: Combined view of last 7 days of social sentiment (Reddit, X/Twitter, StockTwits, etc.), plus latest company news and notable price action patterns.
- Signal palette (tentative): bullish/bearish/mixed based on sentiment swing, news catalysts, and price/volume context.

What I would measure and how (data-driven outline)
- Social media sentiment
  - Reddit: daily sentiment score, top upvoted themes, burst days (sudden spikes in posts/comments), sentiment by subreddits (e.g., r/Investing, r/stocks, r/wallstreetsilver, etc.)
  - X/Twitter: authoritativeness of posts, engagement spikes, sentiment trends around key keywords (PLTR, Palantir, Gotham/AI, government contracts, data privacy)
  - StockTwits / YouTube / other: keyword clusters, sentiment distribution, notable influencers
- News and headlines
  - Recent contracts, product releases, earnings-related comments, regulatory or geopolitical headlines that could affect demand for Palantir’s data/AI platforms
  - M&A rumors or strategic partnerships
- Price-action context
  - Short-term momentum: intraday moves, gap behavior, volatility regime (low/medium/high), volume patterns
  - Relation to sentiment: do sentiment shifts precede, coincide with, or lag price moves?
- Thematic analysis
  - Core themes: government contracts, national security, data privacy concerns, AI/automation adoption, competitive positioning, talent/pipeline updates
  - Sentiment by theme: bullish, bearish, neutral
- Risk factors and dissenting signals
  - Bearish catalysts: negative regulatory risk, contract pullbacks, competition, execution concerns
  - Bullish catalysts: favorable contract wins, enterprise traction, product enhancements, favorable AI/ML integrations

What traders should watch (actionable considerations)
- If sentiment is turning bullish on a supportive news backdrop (e.g., a major contract win, favorable AI product update) with constructive price action (recovering dip, rising volume), it could support a near-term upside bias.
- If sentiment deteriorates amid negative headlines (privacy concerns, regulatory scrutiny) and price action weakens on high volume, consider risk-managed approaches (tight stop, reduced size or hedging).
- Watch for sentiment spikes that precede price moves (leading indicator) vs. those that lag (confirming moves).

Illustrative risk factors for PLTR (contextual, not predictive)
- Dependency on government and enterprise contracts: sensitivity to procurement cycles and political/regulatory changes.
- Competitive landscape in AI-enabled data analytics: differentiating with platform capabilities and data partnerships.
- Public perception of data privacy and surveillance implications: potential risk if coverage shifts unfavorably.
- Execution and profitability signals: any updates on margin expansion, unit economics, and operating leverage.

Data interpretation framework (how I would present the findings)
- Daily sentiment trajectory: a chart of sentiment score per day (positive/neutral/negative distribution).
- Top themes: a ranked list of recurring topics with sentiment weights.
- News catalysts: bullets linking headlines to sentiment shifts and potential price impact.
- Risk/Opportunity matrix: mapping themes to potential upside/downside scenarios and policy/regulatory risk.
- Confidence and data quality notes: visibility caveats for each data source and any known biases.

Sample structure for the final report (end of analysis)
- Executive summary
- Data sources and methodology
- Day-by-day sentiment overview (7 days)
- Thematic sentiment breakdown
- Key news events and their potential impact
- Price-action context and pattern observation
- Risk assessment and scenario analysis
- Trader implications and actionable signals
- Watchlist and next steps
- Appendix: data tables and charts

Proposed Markdown table (key points to organize once data is available)

- The following table is a placeholder framework to organize the final insights. I will populate it with real values after the data fetch succeeds.

Markdown table (Key points)
- Theme | Data Source | 7-day Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) | Notable Events | Price Action Context | Trader Implications | Confidence Level

If you’d like, I can proceed with the data-fetch retry now and then deliver the full data-driven report as soon as the tool returns results. Otherwise, I can provide a fully worked-out qualitative report using this framework and clearly label placeholders for data-driven numbers. What would you prefer?
