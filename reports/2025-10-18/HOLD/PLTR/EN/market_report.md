I attempted to fetch PLTR data to run the indicators, but the data retrieval step failed with a FileNotFoundError. I can retry as soon as the data service is available again. In the meantime, here’s a carefully chosen set of indicators (8 total) that provide complementary insights and avoid redundancy. Once data is retrievable, I’ll generate the actual indicator values and a detailed, nuanced trend report.

Selected indicators (8) with rationale for PLTR
- close_50_sma (50 SMA): Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps assess whether PLTR is in an uptrend or downtrend and where pullbacks might find support.
- close_200_sma (200 SMA): Long-term trend benchmark. Confirms the overarching trend and can flag golden/death cross dynamics when crossovers occur with shorter moving averages.
- close_10_ema (10 EMA): Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts and potential entry points, useful for spotting early trend changes when combined with longer-term averages.
- macd (MACD): Momentum snapshot via the difference between two EMAs. Crossovers and divergences help identify trend changes or confirm momentum strength.
- macds (MACD Signal): The smoothed MACD line. Crossovers with MACD provide more robust entry/exit signals when used with MACD.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Momentum strength visualization. The histogram helps spot momentum expansion/contraction and potential divergences earlier than line crossovers.
- rsi (RSI): Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; useful for divergence analysis in conjunction with trend context.
- atr (ATR): Volatility measure for risk management. Guides stop placement and position-sizing adjustments; rising volatility often precedes larger price moves.

How these indicators work together for PLTR
- Trend confirmation: If price sits above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA, with price above 10 EMA, the bias is bullish and pullbacks to the moving averages may offer higher-probability entries.
- Momentum validation: A bullish MACD line crossing above its signal, supported by a positive MACD histogram, reinforces upside momentum. RSI should be watched for whether it’s trending in overbought territory or showing signs of exhaustion/divergence.
- volatility risk management: A rising ATR indicates increasing volatility; use this to adjust stop distances and position sizes to avoid outsized risk during volatile periods.
- risk filters: If RSI diverges from price (e.g., price makes new highs while RSI doesn’t), use MACD/ATR signals to confirm whether momentum can sustain the move or a pullback is likely.

Proposed next steps (once data is available)
- Retrieve PLTR historical data for the desired window.
- Compute the 8 indicators listed above.
- Produce a detailed trend report: current alignment across trend (MAs), momentum (MACD components, RSI), and volatility risk (ATR). Highlight convergence/divergence signals and potential entry/exit zones.
- Provide a concise trading brief with example scenarios (bullish, neutral, bearish) and suggested risk controls (stop placement, sizing).

Markdown table: Key indicators at a glance
| Indicator | Category | Purpose | How to interpret for PLTR |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction & dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend; pullbacks to 50SMA can be bounces; cross below may signal weakness. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend baseline | Price above 200SMA indicates long-term bullish context; cross below can imply longer-term risk. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum entry signals | Price above 10EMA indicates near-term bullish momentum; cross below may precede a pullback. |
| macd | MACD | Momentum changes / trend shifts | MACD line above signal is bullish; below is bearish; histogram confirms strength. |
| macds | MACD | MACD signal smoothing | Crosses with MACD strengthen or weaken trade signals; helps reduce false positives. |
| macdh | MACD | Momentum strength / divergence | Positive histogram indicates rising momentum; divergences can warn of exhaustion. |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold status & momentum divergence | RSI >70 overbought, <30 oversold; watch for divergences and pullbacks in context of trend. |
| atr | Volatility | Volatility-based risk management | Rising ATR signals higher volatility; adjust stops and sizing accordingly. |

Notes
- Data retrieval is currently failing on my end. I can retry immediately or on your confirmation. If you’d like, I can also proceed with a qualitative, rule-of-thumb interpretation framework using generic PLTR patterns until the data feed is restored.
- Once data is back, I’ll deliver a detailed, data-backed trend report with concrete signals (entry/exit zones, stop levels, risk considerations) and a refreshed 8-indicator reading.
