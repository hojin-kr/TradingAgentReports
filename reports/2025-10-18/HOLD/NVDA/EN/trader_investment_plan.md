Recommendation:
- Buy NVDA on a confirmed breakout above 200 with above-average volume and positive momentum. If NVDA is not yet breaking 200, monitor closely and be prepared to initiate a starter position on a decisive close above 200 with strong volume; otherwise hold and wait for a clear breakout signal.

Rationale (foundation from the plan):
- AI infrastructure tailwinds continue to support durable growth for Nvidia, with CUDA ecosystem moat and software stack reinforcing long-term upside.
- Near-term catalysts (data-center momentum, upgrades, partnerships) provide credible upside potential and room for re-rating if the breakout holds.
- A clean breakout above 200 with sustained momentum (price/volume confirmation and improving MACD/RSI signals) offers a favorable risk-reward setup.

Entry and risk management:
- Entry trigger: close above 200 on higher-than-average volume; initiate a starter long (1–2% of portfolio), scale in if momentum persists.
- Position sizing and risk: use a cautious risk budget (e.g., 2–4% of portfolio for full exposure); consider ATR-based stops roughly 1.5x–2x below the breakout level (e.g., around 195–198 if breakout is near 200).
- Stop and exit rules: if price closes back below 200 on high volume, reduce or exit; set a hard plan to take partial profits if upper targets are hit and momentum fades.
- Hedging: optional use of short-term call spreads or protective puts to cap downside during volatile periods.

Targets:
- Short-to-mid targets: 210–230 as long as the uptrend and AI demand signals stay intact.
- Extend beyond 230 only if earnings guidance and bookings reinforce the AI tailwind and momentum remains strong.

Review and contingencies:
- Regularly reassess momentum and macro catalysts; adjust stops and targets weekly and after major events.
- If data flow is temporarily unavailable, rely on the breakout signal with disciplined risk controls; restore full indicators as soon as data returns.

Learnings:
- No past memories found. Maintain disciplined risk controls, require multi-indicator confirmation, and be ready to adapt if macro or momentum signals deteriorate.

Contingency if breakout is not immediate:
- If NVDA remains below 200, hold and wait for a decisive close above 200 with volume; avoid chasing and preserve capital with tight risk management.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
