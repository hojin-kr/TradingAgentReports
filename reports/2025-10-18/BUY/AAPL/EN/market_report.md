Sorry—I ran into a data fetch error pulling AAPL data from Yahoo Finance in this environment.

Error encountered:
- FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

What this means: I can’t access the required price data for 2024-01-01 to 2025-10-18 right now, so I can’t compute the indicators or generate a data-driven trend report at this moment. I can retry, try a different date window, or proceed with a strategy-focused indicator plan you can use once data is available. Below is a concrete, complementary 8-indicator setup tailored for AAPL, along with how I’d interpret signals once the data is retrievable.

Recommended 8 indicators for AAPL (complementary, non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s suitable for AAPL: Helps identify the prevailing trend against large-cap, high-volatility moves and filters choppiness when used with faster signals.
- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend baseline.
  - Why it’s suitable: Useful for confirming major trend regime (golden/death cross potential) and for strategic bias on longer horizons.
- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average; responsive short-term momentum.
  - Why it’s suitable: Captures quick momentum shifts and potential entry/exit points; helps flag changes in price pace that the longer SMAs might lag on.
- macd
  - What it measures: MACD line (difference of EMAs) signaling momentum changes.
  - Why it’s suitable: Core momentum signal; crossovers with the MACD line can indicate trend changes, especially when price is above/below major averages.
- macds
  - What it measures: MACD Signal line (EMA of MACD).
  - Why it’s suitable: Used with the MACD line crossovers to generate clearer entry/exit cues and reduce false positives when combined with other filters.
- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index; momentum with overbought/oversold levels.
  - Why it’s suitable: Helps identify potential reversals or continuations when combined with trend context; watch for divergences in stronger trends.
- atr
  - What it measures: Average True Range; volatility gauge.
  - Why it’s suitable: Critical for position sizing and stop placement; helps adapt risk to current volatility, especially around earnings or macro events that drive swings in AAPL.
- vwma
  - What it measures: Volume-Weighted Moving Average; price action confirmed by volume.
  - Why it’s suitable: Adds a volume-filtered trend view; supports or contradicts price action when price moves with or against volume spikes.

How I’d interpret signals once data is available (nuanced, not just “up/down”)
- Trend confirmation:
  - If price is consistently above both close_50_sma and close_200_sma, with rising VWMA and a bullish MACD, consider a constructive bias for longs.
  - If price trades below both SMAs, with weak VWMA and bearish MACD, bias toward shorts or cautious stance on long entries.
- Momentum timing:
  - A bullish MACD crossover (MACD above the MACD Signal) with positive RSI slope and price above 10 EMA strengthens a potential entry setup.
  - A MACD bearish crossover paired with RSI failing to create new highs can warn of a pullback or consolidation phase.
- Volatility and risk:
  - Rising ATR indicates expanding volatility; tighten stops or reduce position size to manage risk, especially near earnings or major product announcements.
  - Constrained ATR with price grinding near SMAs suggests a range-bound environment; rely more on breakout-related signals (bol bands or VWMA confluence) for entries.
- Volume confirmation:
  - Price moves above VWMA with rising volume reinforce a bullish move; price moves through VWMA on light volume may be a false breakout risk.
- Reversion risk:
  - RSI hitting extreme overbought/oversold levels (e.g., >70 or <30) in isolation is less reliable in strong trends; cross-check with MACD and SMA context to avoid premature exits/entries.
- Earnings/events context:
  - Expect higher implied volatility; ATR-based adjustments to risk and position sizing are particularly important around these dates to manage gaps and slippage.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching AAPL data now (or with a different date window) to generate the actual data-driven indicator values and a detailed trend report.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with this plan using a hypothetical data snapshot or you can provide a CSV/data feed I should use.

If you’d like me to retry automatically, tell me the preferred date window (e.g., include more recent data through today, or shift start date) and I’ll attempt again.

Appendix: quick reference table (indicators and purpose)
| Indicator | What it measures | How signals are interpreted | Use case for AAPL context |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day trend baseline | Price above/below indicates medium-term trend; crossovers with price help timing | Trend confirmation and dynamic support/resistance |
| close_200_sma | 200-day long-term trend | Price above/below; golden/death cross signals | Strategic bias; helps avoid whipsaws in volatile periods |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts; crossovers with price/longer averages signal entries | Capture early momentum moves, fine-tune timing |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Crossovers indicate momentum shifts; positive/negative divergence matters | Core momentum filter for entries/exits |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Crosses with MACD for trade signals; filters false positives | Smoother trigger alongside MACD |
| rsi | Momentum strength; overbought/oversold | Overbought/oversold levels and divergences signal reversals | Reversal/dip protection; avoid early entries in strong trends |
| atr | Market volatility | Higher ATR means wider stop placement; risk per trade scales with volatility | Risk management and position sizing around volatility spikes |
| vwma | Price action filtered by volume | Price/bar movement confirmed by volume strengthens signals | Volume-confirmed trend direction; better entry/exit conviction |

Please let me know how you want to proceed: retry data fetch now, adjust date range, or switch to a hypothetical analysis.
