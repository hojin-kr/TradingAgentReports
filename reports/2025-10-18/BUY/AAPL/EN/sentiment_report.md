Apologies — I attempted to fetch the Reddit stock data for AAPL on 2025-10-18, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source or file path it relies on isn’t accessible right now.

Ways we can move forward:
- Option A: Retry the Reddit data fetch now to see if the issue is temporary.
- Option B: Proceed with a structured qualitative analysis using other sources you approve (e.g., public news, other social platforms, or you provide links to specific threads).
- Option C: Wait until the Reddit tool is fixed and then run the full analysis in one go.

What I can deliver next (even if Reddit data is temporarily unavailable):
- A comprehensive long-form report outline analyzing social sentiment, recent company news, and implications for traders.
- A detailed methodology for sentiment analysis, daily sentiment breakdown, key themes, and risk signals.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points (themes, data sources, notable events, sentiment direction, and trading implications).

If you’d like, here is a ready-to-fill Markdown table structure I’ll populate once data is available:

- Section: Key sentiment themes
  - Theme
  - sentiment_direction (positive/negative/neutral)
  - sample_mentions (brief)
  - potential catalysts

- Section: Daily sentiment summary (past 7 days)
  - Date
  - Avg_sentiment_score
  - Top_topics
  - Notable_posts or threads (sample)

- Section: Notable news (past 7 days)
  - Date
  - Headline / Source
  - Impact assessment (bullish/bearish/neutral)

- Section: Sentiment-volatility insights
  - Metric (e.g., comment volume, post velocity)
  - Observed pattern
  - Implication for traders

- Section: Trader implications and scenarios
  - Base case
  - Bull case
  - Bear case
  - Key risks

- Section: Data gaps and next steps
  - Gaps
  - Suggested enhancements (additional data sources or tools)

Would you like me to:
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
2) Start with Option B and proceed with a qualitative analysis using alternate sources (please specify which sources you want included), or
3) Provide the full skeleton/report outline now and fill in the details once data becomes available?

If you prefer, I can also proceed with Option B immediately using the best-available public signals (without Reddit) and deliver a detailed report with a Markdown table.
