Sorry — I hit an internal error with the Reddit stock info tool right now. The tool returned a FileNotFoundError, so I can’t pull the latest TSLA sentiment data from Reddit at the moment.

What would you like to do next?
- Option A: I retry the Reddit data pull now (same date 2025-10-18) and proceed with a full, detailed report once it succeeds.
- Option B: I retry with a different date or extend to a broader past week if you want more data.
- Option C: I proceed with a qualitative, framework-based analysis for TSLA using public signals I can discuss without the tool (note: this won’t include direct Reddit data).
- Option D: You provide an alternative data source or data dump (e.g., a CSV of sentiment by day), and I’ll build the report from that.

If you want me to proceed with Option A (retry now), I’ll attempt again as soon as the tool is available. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the long report and the end-Makrdown table I will append once data is in:

What I’ll cover in the full report (once data is accessible)
- Daily sentiment sweep: quantify positive/neutral/negative sentiment day-by-day over the past week, with notable spikes tied to headlines or events.
- Social signals: key themes driving sentiment (e.g., product updates, production milestones, price targets, regulatory news, supply chain chatter, AI initiatives, competition).
- Newsflow snapshot: a brief synthesis of macro and company news over the week that likely influenced sentiment.
- Drivers and catalysts: what’s likely to move TSLA sentiment next (earnings cadence, model launches, energy/storage developments, capex plans, regulatory changes).
- Risk factors: sentiment-driven risk (e.g., polarization around valuation, delivery/margin concerns, supply chain risk, macro headwinds).
- Trading implications: how sentiment momentum, headline risk, and trendlines could influence short-term moves; possible entry/exit scenarios and risk controls.
- Quantified takeaways: top 5 observations with bullet-backed rationale.

Markdown table (to be appended at the end)
- Columns: Theme / Sentiment Tilt / Key Drivers / Timeliness (date or event) / Potential Trade Implication / Data Source

Example structure (placeholder, to be filled after data arrives)
- Theme: Sentiment Pulse
  - Sentiment Tilt: Positive / Neutral / Negative
  - Key Drivers: e.g., “new Model Y pricing sequence,” “Giga Texas updates”
  - Timeliness: 2025-10-17
  - Trade Implication: Short-term upside bias / caution on pullbacks
  - Data Source: Reddit, Newswire, social mentions

If you’d like me to proceed now with a retry (Option A), please confirm and I’ll attempt again immediately. If you prefer one of the other options, tell me which one and I’ll tailor the approach accordingly.
