I’m running into an issue pulling the data right now (the data fetch tool is returning a FileNotFoundError). I can retry fetching TSLA data, or proceed with a data-less, plan-only analysis focusing on the selected indicators. Which would you prefer? If you’d like, I can retry automatically in a moment and then provide a full data-backed, nuanced report.

In the meantime, I’ve prepared a set of up to 8 complementary indicators that are well-suited for TSLA given its typical volatility and momentum-driven moves. I’ve selected them to provide a balanced view across trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context.

Selected indicators (8)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these are suitable for TSLA
- close_50_sma: Captures the medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming whether price is trending higher or lower in the current window.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend anchor. Helps filter signals in choppier periods and assess whether the asset is in a broader uptrend or downtrend.
- close_10_ema: Quick momentum gauge. Great for catching early shifts in price action, especially useful in TSLA’s often rapid moves around catalysts.
- macd: Momentum and potential trend-change signals via MACD line crossovers and divergence. Helpful to time entries with the direction of the underlying trend.
- macds: The smoother MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD itself provide an additional confirmatory layer to MACD signals.
- rsi: Momentum strength with overbought/oversold cues. TSLA can stay extended in strong runs, so RSI along with trend context helps gauge risk of reversals.
- boll: Bollinger middle (20-SMA) as a dynamic baseline for price movement. When used with how far price rides the bands, it helps spot breakouts or reversals in volatile conditions.
- atr: Volatility gauge for risk management and position sizing. Aids in setting stop losses and understanding current price swing magnitude.

Nuanced, data-driven interpretation framework (when data is available)
- Trend context (50SMA vs 200SMA)
  - Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA suggests a stronger uptrend bias; look for pullbacks to the 50SMA as potential entries if momentum indicators align.
  - Price below both and 50SMA below 200SMA signals a downtrend bias; rally attempts to 50SMA may fail unless momentum confirms a reversal.
  - A cross of 50SMA over 200SMA (golden cross) or under (death cross) can provide strategic directional cues; use MACD and RSI to filter false signals.

- Momentum confirmation (MACD and MACDS)
  - MACD line crossing above the MACD signal and/or MACD histogram turning positive supports a shift toward bullish momentum; validate with price crossing above key moving averages.
  - MACD histogram increasing in the same direction as price action reinforces the strength of the move; Divergences between price and MACD histogram can warn of a potential reversal.

- Short-term momentum (RSI)
  - RSI climbing toward or above 70 in uptrends signals strong momentum but potential for a pullback; look for RSI to diverge if price continues higher.
  - RSI dipping toward 30 or below in downtrends signals oversold conditions; confirm with price action holding above support and momentum turning higher.

- Volatility and price envelope ( Boll and ATR)
  - Price riding the Bollinger middle and expanding toward the upper band can indicate growing bullish momentum, especially when confirmed by MACD and RSI.
  - ATR readings rising suggest increasing volatility; adjust risk management and stops accordingly. A rising ATR during uptrends can reflect healthy momentum, while rising ATR in downtrends can imply accelerating downside risk.

- Baseline behavior and breakouts (boll and 10-EMA)
  - A price rally that moves above the 10-EMA and comfortably above the Boll middle line enhances confidence in a short-term breakout, provided RSI and MACD align.
  - Pullbacks toward the Boll middle or 10-EMA after a breakout can present lower-risk entries if momentum remains positive.

- Volume context (Note: VWMA is not selected in this set; if volume context becomes critical, we can consider adding VWMA later)
  - While not included here, if volume confirms price moves (e.g., rising price with rising volume), it strengthens the signal from price-based indicators.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now to generate a fully data-backed, detailed narrative for TSLA on 2025-10-18. If you’d like, I’ll proceed with another fetch attempt and then deliver a precise, step-by-step, data-driven trend and signal report using the 8 indicators above.
- Alternatively, if you prefer a qualitative framework right away, I can deliver scenario-focused insights and potential trades to watch, clearly labeling where data would update the conclusions once available.

Appendix: Key points table
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  What it measures: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance
  How to use: Look for price above/below and for crossovers with price action around the 50SMA to gauge trend health

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  What it measures: Long-term trend direction
  How to use: Use as a strategic filter; watch for golden/death cross with shorter-term indicators for signals

- Indicator: close_10_ema
  What it measures: Short-term momentum
  How to use: Use for timely entry/exit hints; filter with longer moving averages to reduce noise

- Indicator: macd
  What it measures: Momentum and trend-change potential
  How to use: Look for MACD line crossovers and crossovers with the signal line; corroborate with price action

- Indicator: macds
  What it measures: MACD signal smoothing
  How to use: Use with MACD for crossovers to improve signal reliability; helps reduce false positives

- Indicator: rsi
  What it measures: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions
  How to use: Watch for 70/30 thresholds and divergences; in strong trends, use trend context to avoid misreads

- Indicator: boll
  What it measures: Basis for Bollinger Bands (20-SMA)
  How to use: Monitor price relation to the middle line and bands; breakouts or band-riding behavior can indicate momentum shifts

- Indicator: atr
  What it measures: Market volatility
  How to use: Use to set stops and size positions; rising ATR signals larger price swings and may warrant wider stops
