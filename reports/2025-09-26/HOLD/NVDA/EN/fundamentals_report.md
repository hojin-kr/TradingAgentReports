Thanks for the Nudge. I attempted to fetch the NVDA fundamentals data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement from SimFin and Finnhub) but the tool layer returned a FileNotFoundError for all requested endpoints. That means the data retrieval interface is currently unavailable in this session. I can:

- Retry fetching data now or after a short interval, or
- Proceed with a detailed qualitative framework and an outline for the report, and fill in the numbers once the data tools come back online, or
- Accept data you provide (e.g., pasted quarterly results) and build the report around that.

Given the situation, here is a thorough plan and a ready-to-fill report skeleton so we can resume quickly once the data tools are back.

What I can deliver right now (structure and methodology)
- Company: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)
- Scope: Fundamental analysis over the past week, focusing on financial documents, company profile, basic financials, financial history, insider sentiment, and insider transactions to aid traders.
- Data sources intended (but currently unavailable in this session): Finnhub insider sentiment and insider transactions; SimFin balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement (both quarterly and annual).

What I will include in the final report (when data is available)
1) Company profile
   - Industry, business model, major segments (gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, AI accelerators), customers, risk factors (semiconductor cyclicality, geopolitical exposure), and competitive landscape (AMD, Intel, other AI chipmakers).
2) Financial snapshot (most recent period)
   - Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EBITDA, margins (gross, operating, net), EPS, and cash from operations.
   - Key balance sheet items: cash & cash equivalents, total assets, total liabilities, equity, debt levels, working capital.
   - Key cash flow items: cash from operating activities, cash used in investing, cash from financing, free cash flow.
3) Financial history (trend analysis)
   - Multi-year and multi-quarter trends for revenue growth, gross margin, operating margin, FCF, and capex efficiency.
   - Leverage/financing structure evolution, capital allocation (share repurchases, dividend policy if any), and dividend yield (if applicable).
   - Inventory and receivables efficiency, and any notable working capital shifts.
4) Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
   - Overall directional sentiment from insiders (buys vs sells, intensity, and any notable patterns around earnings or major product launches).
   - Relation to stock movement, insider confidence vs price action.
5) Insider transactions (past 15 days)
   - Recency and magnitude of insider buys/sells.
   - Context around large transactions (executive purchases, board member changes).
6) Valuation and multiples (if data available)
   - P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S, P/B, and any sector-relative comparisons.
   - Growth expectations (expected revenue growth, AI/Tensor/Omni-portfolio uplift, hyperscaler demand) and how that’s priced in.
7) Risks and catalysts
   - Semiconductor supply chain, AI demand cycles, product lifecycle, competition (e.g., AMD, Intel, and emerging AI accelerator startups), regulatory considerations, and geopolitical risk.
8) Trader-oriented takeaways
   - Short-term catalysts (product launches, earnings timing, AI demand cycles) and risk management scenarios (bear/bull cases, downside/upside price targets).
9) Appendices
   - Data tables (quarterly and annual where appropriate), reconciliation notes, and data source metadata.

Proposed next steps
- If you want me to proceed right now, I can:
  - Retry all data calls in a few minutes, or
  - Run a staggered approach: fetch one data type at a time (e.g., insider sentiment first, then insider transactions, then quarterly financials, then annuals) to isolate where the issue lies.
- Alternatively, you can provide the data you have (even partial data) and I will integrate it into the report with a detailed interpretation.

Draft placeholder Markdown table (to be filled with actual data once the tools return)
- This table will summarize key points and allow quick scanning for traders.

Apologies for the inconvenience. I’m ready to retry the data fetch now or at your preferred time. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry data retrieval now
- Retry after a short interval
- Proceed with a qualitative, data-light analysis while we wait
- Provide data you already have and I’ll build the report around it
