Recommendation: Hold NVDA for now.

Rationale (why this conclusion fits the plan)
- Bull case remains plausible: AI infrastructure demand and OpenAI-related momentum could drive gains, but the catalysts are not yet proven at scale and valuation remains a concern.
- Bear case/error risks: high multiple potentially vulnerable to multiple compression, margin pressure from capex, regulatory/headline risk, and turnover in data-center demand.
- Price action context: a breakout above 184–186 with convincing volume would strengthen the bull case, but current levels are not signaling a durable breakout yet.

Actionable trading plan (practical steps)

If you already own NVDA
- Risk ceiling: establish a hard stop around 170–172 to guard against a sharp reversal.
- Hedging: consider a modest protective hedge (e.g., buying puts or a collar) to cap downside while preserving upside if a breakout above 184–186 materializes with solid volume.
- Upgrade trigger: do not add meaningfully until a confirmed breakout above 184–186 on convincing volume occurs. If that breakout happens, reassess for a weighted upgrade toward Buy.
- Monitoring: track OpenAI utilization signals, hyperscaler capex cadence, gross margin trajectory, and any regulatory headlines. Treat negative headlines as risk triggers.

If you do not own NVDA
- Entry guardrails: avoid rushing in at current levels.
- Buy triggers:
  - Primary: a clean close above 184–186 with strong volume as a Buy signal (consider a staged entry, e.g., 1/2 position first, then add on confirmation).
  - Alternative starter: if price pulls back to 170–175 and forms higher lows on turnover, consider a small starter with a tight stop.
- Position sizing: keep exposure modest until the OpenAI-driven revenue durability and broader AI infrastructure demand are clearer.

Data and risk management
- Data refresh: re-evaluate within 24–48 hours; if data sources fail, rely on alternative signals and qualitative assessments.
- Indicators to watch: trend lines, MACD, RSI, VWMA, and the 184–186 breakout level with volume; monitor gross margin and capex intensity as sanity checks.
- Exit framework: if a breakout is failed or momentum deteriorates, reassess within 4–8 weeks; if price falls decisively below the 170–172 zone with negative momentum, consider tightening risk controls or exiting.

Lessons integrated
- Use scenario-based thinking (base/bull/bear) with explicit triggers and hedges.
- Prepare for data gaps with fallback qualitative checks.
- Align valuation with cash-flow realities (margin trajectory and capex efficiency) rather than growth alone.
- Coupling bullish theses with disciplined risk controls and predefined exits.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
