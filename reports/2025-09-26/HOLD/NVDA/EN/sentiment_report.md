I tried to fetch the Reddit stock data for NVDA on 2025-09-26, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a backend/tool issue rather than a data problem. I can retry the data pull, or if you prefer, I can proceed with a best-effort NVDA analysis using other public sources and provide a detailed, trader-focused report even without the Reddit feed.

Options:
- Option 1: I retry the Reddit data fetch now and then deliver the full social sentiment + news report with the latest Reddit insights included.
- Option 2: I proceed immediately with a comprehensive NVDA analysis based on social sentiment themes and recent news from sources I can access in this session (without the Reddit feed), clearly labeling any data gaps.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option 2 right away, here’s what I’ll deliver:
- Executive summary: current state of sentiment to traders, key drivers, and risks for NVDA.
- Social sentiment themes: recurring topics (AI demand, data-center growth, supply chain, regulatory/export controls, earnings expectations), with emphasis on what daily chatter indicates about momentum or concern.
- News overview: notable NVDA-related headlines in the past week (earnings context, product/tech developments, regulatory/regulatory-licensing headlines, partnerships, guidance notes).
- Sentiment/narrative shifts: how themes evolved over days (where data is available) and what that implies for short- to intermediate-term moves.
- Trader implications: actionable takeaways, potential setups, risk factors, and watch-levels (price levels, catalysts, and sentiment risks).
- Makrdown table: a compact, easy-to-scan summary of the above points.

Please tell me which option you prefer (retry the Reddit tool now, or proceed with Option 2). If you want me to proceed with Option 2, I’ll start immediately and present the full report. Also, if you want a final trading stance (Buy/Hold/Sell) attached, let me know and I’ll include that in the closing.
