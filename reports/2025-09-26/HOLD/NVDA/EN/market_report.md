I attempted to fetch NVDA price data (2024-01-01 to 2025-09-26) via get_YFin_data, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like a backend issue on the data retrieval layer rather than a problem with your request. I can retry in a moment, or I can proceed with a plan and indicator selections so we’re ready once the data fetch succeeds. Let me know your preference. In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan and rationale you can review.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators, diverse and complementary)
- close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum indicator to capture quick shifts and potential entry points. Helps detect fast changes in NVDA’s intraday/trend momentum.
- close_50_sma: A mid-term trend benchmark that provides dynamic support/resistance and helps confirm the prevailing trend when combined with other signals.
- close_200_sma: A long-term trend reference to confirm the larger regime (bullish vs bearish) and to identify potential golden/death-cross contexts in the bigger picture.
- macd: Momentum measure that reacts to differences between short and longer EMAs; useful for identifying trend changes via crossovers and potential divergences.
- macds: MACD signal line, used with MACD for trigger points when the MACD crosses the signal line, adding a confirmation layer to signals.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator to gauge overbought/oversold conditions and look for divergences that could precede reversals, especially when aligned with trend context.
- atr: Volatility gauge to help calibrate risk management (tick-height for stops, position sizing) and to assess breakout potential with current market volatility.
- vwma: Volume-weighted moving average to confirm price action in the context of volume; helps validate price moves when volume supports the move.

Rationale for the NVDA context
- NVDA tends to exhibit pronounced momentum and volatility around earnings, AI-related catalysts, and chip supply/demand news. A combination of trend (50 SMA, 200 SMA), short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD family), and volatility/risk controls (ATR) provides a balanced view.
- The 3 moving-average stack (10-EMA, 50-SMA, 200-SMA) allows you to gauge short-term micro-trends against longer-term regime, helping to identify potential entries that align with the broader trend.
- MACD and RSI together give you both momentum shifts (MACD crossovers/divergence) and price-velocity context (RSI extremes and potential reversals), which is valuable for a stock with strong directional moves.
- ATR offers practical guidance for setting stops and understanding whether price swings are normal or expansionary, which is crucial for a stock with high volatility like NVDA.
- VWMA confirms price moves with volume, which is particularly relevant in NVDA’s volatile environment where volume can precede or validate breakouts.

What I’ll deliver once data retrieval succeeds
- A detailed, nuanced report describing:
  - Trend analysis from moving averages (crossovers, support/resistance near 50/200 SMA, price position relative to 10-EMA).
  - Momentum signals from MACD and RSI, including confirmed crossovers and potential divergences.
  - Volatility and risk context from ATR, including appropriate stop-loss zones and position-sizing guidance.
  - Volume confirmation from VWMA to validate moves and identify false breakouts.
- A final set of actionable takeaways with potential entry/exit perspectives, given NVDA’s recent price action and the current indicators.

Next steps
- I can retry the data fetch now or after a brief wait. If you’d like, I can also adjust the date window (e.g., last 12–18 months) or test a narrower range to improve the chance of a successful data fetch.
- Alternatively, you can provide explicit permission to proceed with the plan using the indicators above, and I’ll generate the full analysis as soon as data retrieval succeeds.

Key points table (indicator overview)
| Indicator | Category | Purpose / What it tells you about NVDA | How to read signals (NVDA context) |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum, quick shifts in price trend | Price above/below 10-EMA flagging near-term momentum; cross with price can signal entries/exits, but confirm with higher timeframes |
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Mid-term trend direction, dynamic support/resistance | Price trading above 50-SMA suggests uptrend bias; crossing below may indicate weakening trend; use with longer-term trend for confirmation |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend benchmark, regime confirmation | Price above 200-SMA indicates bullish regime; price below may indicate bearish regime; golden/death cross with 50-SMA can be meaningful when synchronized with other signals |
| macd | MACD | Momentum shift via EMA differences | MACD line crossing above/below zero or MACD crossing its signal line signals momentum changes; look for corroboration with price action |
| macds | MACD Signal | Smoothing of MACD to produce triggers | Crosses with MACD line generate potential entry/exit signals; use with MACD histogram for momentum strength confirmation |
| rsi | Momentum Indicator | Overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals | RSI >70 overbought, <30 oversold; watch for divergences with price and confirmation from trend context |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility and risk management guide | Higher ATR implies wider price swings; adjust stops and sizing accordingly; use with position sizing and risk controls |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Volume-confirmed price moves | Price movement aligned with rising VWMA strengthens move; divergences with VWMA can warn of weak or false moves |

Notes and caveats
- Once the data fetch succeeds, I’ll run these indicators and provide a detailed, NVDA-specific narrative, including trend stitching, momentum timing, and risk-managed entry/exit ideas.
- If you’d prefer a different balance (e.g., include bollinger bands for a volatility breakout perspective or add VWMA if you want stronger volume context), I can adjust the indicator set accordingly (up to 8 indicators total).

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with this indicator plan and deliver the full NVDA analysis as soon as the data is accessible?
