I ran into an internal issue fetching Reddit data for QQQ: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the Reddit data tool is currently unavailable or misconfigured.

What would you like to do next?
- Option 1: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll reattempt and then generate the full weekly sentiment/news report once it succeeds).
- Option 2: I proceed with a high-quality qualitative analysis in the meantime (no live Reddit data yet) — I’ll outline likely sentiment drivers, risk factors, and trading implications for QQQ and update with actual sentiment once the data tool is back.
- Option 3: I switch to an alternative data source or adjust the scope (e.g., focus on the ETF’s top holdings or macro/news catalysts rather than Reddit sentiment).

If you prefer, I can proceed with a thorough plan and a preliminary report now (without live Reddit sentiment numbers), including:
- What QQQ represents (Nasdaq-100 ETF) and typical sentiment drivers (mega-cap tech names, earnings season, AI narrative, macro rate expectations).
- A framework for daily sentiment scoring and a synthesis of recent headlines/news that generally impact QQQ.
- Trading implications and risk considerations for traders, given the current macro environment (e.g., rate trajectory, AI stock performance, tech earnings cadence).
- A Markdown table skeleton at the end to organize key points once data is in.

Please choose Option 1, 2, or 3, and I’ll proceed accordingly.
