## Price Action and Technical Levels
- Near-term posture: Mixed/softening price action in tech leadership; QQQ sensitive to rate path and inflation surprises.
- Actionable price levels to monitor:
  - **S1: 50-day moving average (dynamic near-term support)**
  - **S2: 200-day moving average (longer-term support)**
  - **R1: prior swing high (near-term resistance)**
  - **R2: next resistance near recent high/round-number level** 
- Trading triggers (based on moves from current level):
  - **Bullish trigger:** Break above +4% from last close → target upside channel to roughly +6% (R2 vicinity)

- Bull Case
  - Inflation cools with durable growth, discount rates compress further, and AI/tech growth visibility improves.
