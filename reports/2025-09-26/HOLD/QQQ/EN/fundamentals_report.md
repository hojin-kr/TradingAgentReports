I attempted to retrieve the data you requested, but the tools returning errors indicate a setup issue: “FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory.” So I don’t have current SimFin or Finnhub data for QQQ to assemble the full fundamental report right now.

A quick but important note about QQQ:
- QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) that tracks the NASDAQ-100 index, not a single company. The kinds of documents you’d pull for a company (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, insider sentiment/transactions) don’t apply to an ETF in the same way.
- For an ETF, useful “fundamental-like” data would include: fund objective, issuer/sponsor, expense ratio, assets under management (AUM), distribution yield, inception date, top holdings and their weights, sector/industry allocations, geographic exposure, liquidity metrics (average daily trading volume), premium/discount to NAV, and performance history.

Given the current tool error, here are two pragmatic options. Tell me which you prefer, or I can proceed with both in sequence:

Option A — Analyze a constituent company (recommended if you want a true fundamental report with income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and insider data):
- Pick a specific constituent of QQQ (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, etc.).
- I’ll fetch quarterly income statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and insider sentiment/transactions for that ticker, then synthesize a comprehensive report with a detailed, trader-friendly analysis and a concluding Markdown table of key points.

Option B — ETF-level overview for QQQ (no company data, but a thorough fund-level snapshot):
- I’ll compile a detailed ETF profile based on known fund data (expense ratio, AUM, distribution yield, inception date, top holdings and weights, sector allocation, and liquidity). I’ll also provide a framework for traders (NAV vs. market price, tracking error, premium/discount, and how macro factors could impact QQQ).
- Note: I won’t be able to provide income statements or insider activity for the ETF, since those aren’t applicable.

If you want me to proceed now, please tell me which option you prefer and, if Option A, the specific constituent ticker you’d like analyzed. Once I have a valid ticker, I’ll pull the data and deliver a comprehensive report with fine-grained insights and a final Markdown table organizing the key points.
