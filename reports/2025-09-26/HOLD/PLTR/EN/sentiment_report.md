Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull the Reddit sentiment data for PLTR for the requested dates, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal error). I can retry the Reddit data fetch, or proceed with alternative sources (e.g., Stocktwits, X/Twitter sentiment, and recent company/news articles) to keep the analysis moving.

Here’s how I suggest we proceed and what I can deliver now:

What I can do right now
- Retry Reddit data fetch for PLTR for 2025-09-20 through 2025-09-26 as soon as the tool is responsive again.
- In parallel (or if you prefer), pull sentiment and news from alternative sources to avoid a data gap and keep the report actionable.

Proposed structure for the comprehensive PLTR report (to be filled with data once available)
- Executive snapshot
  - Overall tone (bullish, bearish, mixed) for the past week
  - Any standout catalysts or warnings
- Daily sentiment snapshot (2025-09-20 to 2025-09-26)
  - Top buzz topics by day
  - Sentiment polarity and volume
  - Notable spikes and potential drivers (news, product announcements, earnings hints, etc.)
- News and catalysts (past week)
  - Company updates, partnerships, product launches, regulatory/licensing news
  - Analyst note increments/price targets if available
- Sentiment vs. price/action
  - Correlation between sentiment shifts and intraday/close price moves
  - Any divergence signals (e.g., positive sentiment with negative price action)
- Thematic analysis
  - Key themes: Palantir Foundry/Vision product traction, gov/enterprises adoption, AI AI/ML capabilities, data privacy/regulatory concerns, PACER/space/defense ties if relevant
  - Public perception on competition, pricing, and deployment ease
- Risk factors to watch
  - Sentiment-driven risk (surprise negative news, execution delays)
  - Macro/tech sector tailwinds or headwinds affecting growth expectations
- Trader implications
  - Short-term trading signals (volatility, reaction to news)
  - Longer-term positioning considerations (growth narrative vs. valuation)
- Data quality notes
  - Data sources used, confidence level, any gaps or caveats

Appendix: Markdown summary table (key points)
I will append a clear, reader-friendly table at the end of the final report with:
- Date
- Primary sentiment trend
- Top topics/drivers
- Notable news
- A quick trader takeaway

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
1) I retry the Reddit data pull now and continue with a full, data-backed report as soon as I have results.
2) Or I proceed immediately with alternative sources (Stocktwits, X sentiment, major news) to deliver a near-term, actionable weekly analysis, and then I can layer Reddit data once it’s available.

If you prefer, I can start with option 2 right away and provide an initial draft with placeholders for Reddit-driven metrics, then update with the Reddit data once the tool is back online.
