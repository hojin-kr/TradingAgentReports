I attempted to fetch PLTR data from Yahoo Finance for the period 2024-03-01 to 2025-09-26 but ran into an internal data retrieval error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry the data fetch now if you’d like, or proceed with a structured indicator plan and wait for the data to come through. Below is a detailed indicator plan using the most relevant, complementary set of indicators for PLTR, plus how to interpret them once the data is available.

Selected indicators (8, non-redundant, complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll_ub
- boll_lb

Rationale for each indicator and how it helps with PLTR
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level. Useful to gauge whether PLTR is in a broader uptrend or downtrend and to filter entries in the direction of the trend.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps confirm major trend regime (golden cross/death cross contexts) and is good for strategic bias rather than frequent entry signals.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum capture. Sensitive to recent price moves and can flag quick shifts in PLTR’s momentum when used with longer-term averages to filter noise.
- macd: Momentum and trend-change signal via crossovers of the MACD line and zero line. Useful to detect shifting momentum, especially after earnings or catalysts.
- macds: MACD Signal line. Crossovers with MACD add confirmation for potential entry/exit signals and help reduce false positives when used with other filters.
- rsi: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions. Helps identify potential reversals or strength in the prevailing move, especially when not in extreme overbought/oversold zones.
- boll_ub: Upper Bollinger Band. Signals overbought pressure and potential breakout zones when price pushes beyond the band, often accompanied by rising volatility.
- boll_lb: Lower Bollinger Band. Indicates oversold pressure and potential reversal zones; helps identify mean-reversion opportunities in a volatile name like PLTR.

How to interpret these indicators together for PLTR (contextual guidance)
- Trend alignment: Look for price above both 50_SMA and 200_SMA for bullish bias; price below both for bearish bias. If price sits between the two, rely more on MACD and RSI for momentum context and wait for a clear break.
- Short-term momentum vs. trend: Use 10_EMA in conjunction with MACD crossovers. A bullish cross of MACD, with price above 50_SMA and 200_SMA, and a rising 10_EMA strengthens a potential entry signal.
- Momentum checks: RSI should be watched for divergence relative to price and for readings that aren’t overly extended (e.g., not strictly over 70 or under 30). In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated for longer; cross-check with MACD and price position relative to moving averages.
- Volatility and breakout context: Bollinger upper and lower bands help identify potential breakout zones or mean-reversion opportunities. A move into or beyond boll_ub with rising volume (if volume data is considered) can signal breakout potential; conversely, touching boll_lb may highlight oversold pressure that could lead to a bounce.
- Risk management implication: When you have a setup aligned across trend (price above MAs), momentum (MACD cross and RSI strength), and volatility breakout cues (boll_ub), consider tighter risk controls (e.g., ATR-informed stops for PLTR’s typical volatility). If any of these signals disagree, you may want to stay neutral or use smaller position sizing until confirmation appears.

Note on data retrieval
- I’ll retry the data fetch for PLTR as soon as you’d like. Once the data is available, I can generate the indicators, run a quick combined signal check, and provide a granular, data-backed verdict with potential entry/exit levels.

Next steps
- Option A: I retry fetching PLTR data now and then run the eight indicators to generate a live-readout of signals and potential trade ideas.
- Option B: You specify a different date range or interval (e.g., daily candles, or a shorter window) and I reattempt.
- Option C: You want me to also include a risk-management indicator like ATR in the discussion for stop placement; I can swap or add one more indicator if you prefer (keeping to eight total).

Markdown table: key points at a glance
| Indicator | Category | Role for PLTR | How to interpret for PLTR context |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Use to confirm medium-term trend; long entries in uptrends when price stays above 50_SMA and 200_SMA. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirm major regime; golden cross/death cross context helps strategic bias. |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Spot quick shifts; use with longer MA for filtering noisy signals. |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend-change signals | Bullish cross supports entry when aligned with price above MAs; bearish cross suggests exit/short bias when aligned with price below MAs. |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line cross confirmations | Cross with MACD strengthens entry/exit signals; helps reduce false positives. |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | Divergence and extreme readings help anticipate reversals; use with trend context. |
| boll_ub | Volatility | Upper breakout/overbought pressure | Price pushing toward/through upper band suggests breakout potential; confirm with MACD/RSI. |
| boll_lb | Volatility | Lower breakout/oversold pressure | Reversion zone signals possible bounce; use with other momentum signals for confirmation. |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching PLTR data now and then provide a data-backed, detailed trend analysis using these eight indicators. Please tell me if you want me to proceed with the retry.
