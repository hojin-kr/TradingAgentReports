Thanks for the update. I attempted to fetch Reddit sentiment for SPY across 2025-09-20 to 2025-09-26, but the Reddit data tool (get_reddit_stock_info) is returning a FileNotFoundError on the environment right now. That means I can’t pull the day-by-day Reddit sentiment data at the moment.

What I can do now
- Provide a solid plan and structure for the long, trader-focused report you asked for, so once the data tool is available again I can plug in the numbers quickly.
- Start with a high-quality narrative analysis using public signals I can reliably discuss (macroeconomic context, recent SPY/ETF-related news headlines, and typical sentiment drivers for the SPY ETF). I’ll clearly mark any parts that require the Reddit data so we can fill them in as soon as the tool is up.

What I can deliver now (without the Reddit feed)
1) High-level macro and news context (past week relative to 2025-09-26)
- Major macro factors likely shaping SPY sentiment in late September 2025: monetary policy expectations (Fed rate trajectory), inflation readings, consumer spending data, labor market signals, and global risk events (geopolitics, supply chains, energy prices).
- Key sectoral drivers: tech and growth rotation, financials, healthcare, and industrials. For SPY, big-name constituents (e.g., tech mega-caps, consumer staples, energy) often drive intraday moves; any notable earnings or guidance from those sectors will ripple into SPY.

2) Sentiment framing (how I’ll present the Reddit data once available)
- Daily sentiment scores by day (2025-09-20 through 2025-09-26) with:
  - Overall sentiment (bullish, bearish, neutral)
  - Theme tags (e.g., "inflation & rate expectations", "earnings outlook", "macro risk events", "technical/flow dynamics", "policy/news catalysts")
  - Volume indicators (mention of SPY vs SPY options, attention spikes)
  - Leading subreddits (e.g., r/investing, r/stocks, r/ETFs, r/SPY)
- Top decile topics or posts driving sentiment spikes (summarized in plain language)

3) Practical trader-focused implications
- Short-term tilt: whether sentiment momentum aligns with recent price action, potential for mean-reversion vs continuation.
- Key catalysts to watch in the next 1–2 weeks (e.g., Fed communications, CPI/PPI releases, major earnings from SPY components, options expiration dates).
- Risk considerations: liquidity events, intraday volatility bursts, sector rotation risk, and hedging ideas (e.g., SPY put wings near expected catalysts).

4) Makrdown table draft (to be completed with Reddit data)
- I’ll append a clean table at the end like:
  - Date | Daily Sentiment | Dominant Themes | Price Action Context | Notable News/Catalysts | Trader Takeaway
  - Then a summary bullet under each row.

Next steps I can take immediately
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a comprehensive analysis that uses any other data I can access reliably (news headlines, official releases, macro data, and public sentiment indicators). Once the Reddit data tool is functioning again, I’ll populate the day-by-day sentiment section and attach the finalized Makrdown table.
- Alternatively, if you want to proceed now with a robust narrative, I can deliver a detailed report focusing on macro drivers, SPY-related headlines, and practical trading implications for the past week, clearly noting where Reddit sentiment will be inserted once the tool returns.

Would you like me to:
A) proceed with a full macro/news-based report now (no Reddit sentiment yet) with a placeholder section for Reddit data, or
B) keep monitoring and re-run the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available, then deliver the completed deep-dive in one go?

If you prefer option A, I can produce a thorough, trader-focused report right away and include a ready-to-fill Slack-style placeholder for Reddit sentiment. If you prefer option B, I’ll reattempt the data pull and deliver the full report with day-by-day Reddit sentiment and a finalized Makrmarkdown table as soon as the tool works.
