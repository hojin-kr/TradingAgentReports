Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for GOOGL across 2025-09-26 to 2025-09-20, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all dates. I can’t retrieve the Reddit data right now, so I can’t complete the full, data-driven weekly sentiment report at the moment.

What I can do next (two options), and I can proceed with either depending on your preference:
- Option A: Retry now and fetch the data one date at a time (or in smaller batches) to bypass the current error and populate the full weekly report with daily sentiment, themes, and potential trading implications.
- Option B: Start with a high-level, data-informed forecast based on public signals I can access without the Reddit tool (e.g., widely reported company news, known earnings/AI product trends, macro tech sentiment) and clearly label that Reddit data will be appended as soon as the tool is back online.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry the Reddit feed), I’ll:
1) Fetch daily Reddit stock sentiment for GOOGL on 2025-09-26 through 2025-09-20 (one date at a time to isolate the error).
2) Compile a detailed weekly report with:
   - Summary: overall tone, hot topics, and notable shifts day-over-day.
   - Daily sentiment: positive/neutral/negative counts, sample posts, and key quotes.
   - Thematic analysis: recurring topics (AI initiatives, regulatory/regulatory risk, ad market dynamics, Google services, Chrome/Android ecosystem, data/privacy, leadership comments).
   - Influence map: who/which subreddits and beta weights are driving sentiment.
   - News alignment: cross-check against any major company news released in the period (product launches, regulatory updates, earnings hints, partnerships).
   - Trading implications: potential catalysts, risk factors, and how sentiment aligns or diverges from price/action.
   - Risks and caveats: tool limitations, potential biases in Reddit data, and how to interpret sentiment versus fundamentals.
   - Makrdown table: a concise, readable table at the end organizing key points by date.

If you prefer Option B, I’ll deliver:
- A thorough qualitative and high-level quantitative assessment of GOOGL’s week based on available public news and sentiment signals (excluding Reddit data for now), with clear caveats about the data gaps.
- A plan to append the Reddit-driven analysis as soon as the tool issue is resolved.

Please tell me which option you’d like. If you approve Option A, I’ll start retrying the Reddit data collection immediately and begin assembling the full report as soon as I have the daily feeds.
