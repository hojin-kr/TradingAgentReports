# Investment Report: NFLX
## Executive Summary
Netflix aims to boost revenue with ads and international growth. Near-term signals are mixed, so we hold for now and require durable cash-flow progress before any move.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold (for now). Confidence level: Medium.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Long-term upside exists from ad monetization and stronger international growth, but near-term progress is unclear.
- Hold is prudent with explicit gates to upgrade to Buy or downgrade to Sell as durable cash-flow and monetization milestones prove themselves.
- Risk controls, including gradual exposure and simple checks on data, help avoid premature risk-taking and potential sharp reversals.

## Risks To Watch
- Sub growth slowing and churn rising could weaken the outlook.
- ARPU mixed or declining could limit revenue progress.
- Ad revenue growth and ROI underperformance could pressure margins.
- Cash-flow visibility and timing of profitability remain uncertain.
- Ad-market health and regional dynamics could add headwinds to monetization efforts.
