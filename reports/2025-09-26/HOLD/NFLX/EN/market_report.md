I attempted to fetch NFLX data for 2024-09-26 to 2025-09-26, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal system issue). I can retry fetching the data now, or proceed with a robust, best-effort qualitative plan while we wait for the data to come through. Please let me know which you prefer. In the meantime, here is a concise plan and the indicator setup I would use once the data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators, non-redundant and complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Establishes the medium-term trend direction and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming trend when price tests this level.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; helps filter trades and identify potential golden/death cross setups when used in conjunction with shorter-term signals.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Provides a more responsive read on short-term momentum; good for catching quick shifts when used with longer-term filters.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum indicator that signals potential trend changes via crossovers and divergence. Helpful to confirm trend strength in conjunction with price action.
- macds: MACD Signal. The moving-average-smoothed signal line; crossovers with the MACD line generate trade signals and help filter false positives from MACD alone.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index. Momentum gauge to identify overbought/oversold conditions and divergence with price, aiding reversals and pullback signals when aligned with the trend.
- atr: Average True Range. Volatility metric to inform risk management—setting stop levels, position sizing, and adapting to changing volatility regimes.
- vwma: Volume-Weighted Moving Average. Confirms price action with volume; helps validate breakouts or reversals when price moves in tandem with volume dynamics.

Rationale for NFLX in this context
- NFLX often exhibits clear trend phases driven by subscriber growth, content slate, and competition dynamics. Combining a medium/long-term trend (50/200 SMA) with a responsive momentum filter (10 EMA) provides a balanced view of trend direction and entry timing.
- MACD signals add a momentum layer to confirm trend changes, while RSI provides divergence cues and overbought/oversold context, which can be particularly informative around earnings events or major content/margins news.
- ATR and VWMA give risk management and volume-concordance context, respectively. ATR helps adapt stop placement to current volatility, and VWMA ensures that price moves are supported by volume, reducing the likelihood of false breakouts in light-volume conditions.

What I will deliver once data is retrieved
- A detailed, fine-grained trend report for NFLX, including:
  - Current trend interpretation (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) across the 50/200 SMA framework.
  - Momentum context from MACD/macds and RSI, including crossovers, divergences, and overbought/oversold implications.
  - Volatility assessment from ATR to gauge risk management implications (stop placement, position sizing).
  - Volume-price confirmation from VWMA to validate breakout or pullback signals.
  - A cohesive view of potential entry/exit zones with condition-based scenarios (e.g., a pullback to the 50SMA with MACD bullish cross and RSI rising from 30s; or a breakout above VWMA with rising ATR and MACD momentum).
- A Markdown table (at the end) summarizing the key points and actionable signals.

Proposed next step
- Please tell me if you’d like me to retry fetching the NFLX data now. If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, data-light analysis immediately, and then update with the full indicator-driven report as soon as the data fetch succeeds.

Markdown table: key indicators, purpose, and how to interpret for NFLX
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Identify medium-term trend; provide dynamic support/resistance
  - Interpretation: Price above 50SMA with a rising slope suggests bullish tendency; price crossing below or testing 50SMA could indicate a pullback or trend weakness.
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Confirm long-term trend; signal potential golden/death cross setups
  - Interpretation: Price above 200SMA indicates long-term bullish bias; a cross of 50SMA above/below 200SMA strengthens directional conviction; a cross of 50 crossing down below 200 could warn of a trend reversal.
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Purpose: Capture short-term momentum shifts
  - Interpretation: Price crossing above/below the 10EMA can precede faster entries or exits; use with longer-term filters to avoid whipsaws.
- Indicator: macd
  - Category: MACD
  - Purpose: Momentum and trend-change signals
  - Interpretation: MACD line crossing above zero and crossing above MACD signal are bullish signals; crossing below zero or below MACD signal are bearish signals.
- Indicator: macds
  - Category: MACD
  - Purpose: Momentum-signal smoothing
  - Interpretation: MACD signal line crossing the MACD line confirms or refines MACD-based entries/exits; use for filter with MACD.
- Indicator: rsi
  - Category: Momentum
  - Purpose: Overbought/oversold context and divergence
  - Interpretation: RSI > 70 may indicate overbought conditions; RSI < 30 may indicate oversold; watch for bullish/bearish divergences in line with price trend.
- Indicator: atr
  - Category: Volatility
  - Purpose: Volatility-based risk management
  - Interpretation: Rising ATR signals increasing volatility (adjust stops accordingly); falling ATR may indicate compressing volatility and potential consolidation.
- Indicator: vwma
  - Category: Volume/Demand
  - Purpose: Volume-confirmed price action
  - Interpretation: Price moving in steps above/below VWMA with rising volume suggests stronger trend validity; price moving through VWMA on low volume warrants caution.

If you’d like, I can try the data fetch again now. Just say “retry” and I’ll run the data request immediately and then proceed with the full indicator-driven analysis and a detailed trend report for NFLX.
