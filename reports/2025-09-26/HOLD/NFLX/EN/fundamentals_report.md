I attempted to fetch NFLX's latest quarterly data (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) and insider sentiment/transactions, but the tool calls failed with a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data retrieval endpoints or the local data cache are currently unavailable. Because of this, I can’t pull the latest figures to include in the report right now.

Here are your options to move forward:

- Option A: Retry now
  - I can re-attempt the same data pulls (SimFin balance sheet, income statement, cash flow; Finnhub insider sentiment; Finnhub insider transactions) and report back as soon as I have them.

- Option B: Proceed with a best-effort qualitative report
  - I can prepare a comprehensive fundamental report for NFLX using:
    - Public, non-archived context about the company (brand positioning, market trends, streaming economics, competitive landscape)
    - Generally understood balance sheet and cash flow structure for a large streaming platform (without the exact latest figures)
    - Inspector insights and insider activity patterns based on typical sources, clearly labeling data as “not latest” if we can’t fetch it
  - This would include scenario analysis, risk factors, and actionable takeaways for traders, with a clearly marked data gap section and a Markdown table at the end summarizing key points.

If you’d like me to retry (Option A), I’ll run the data pulls again as soon as possible and provide a fully fleshed-out report with the latest numbers you can act on.

If you’d like Option B (best-effort qualitative), I’ll proceed right away and structure the report as follows:
- Executive summary
- Company profile
- Financial snapshot (qualitative)
- Income statement highlights (qualitative)
- Balance sheet highlights (qualitative)
- Cash flow highlights (qualitative)
- Insider sentiment overview (qualitative, caveated)
- Insider transactions overview (qualitative, caveated)
- Trend analysis and trader-focused insights
- Key risks and catalysts
- Final markdown table of key points

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to try again now, I’ll proceed with the retries immediately.
