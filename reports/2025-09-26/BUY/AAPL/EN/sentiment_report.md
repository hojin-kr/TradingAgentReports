Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch Reddit stock info for AAPL on 2025-09-26 but encountered a backend error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

What this means
- The Reddit data tool is currently unavailable or misconfigured (the backend path or dataset it expects isn’t present).
- I canRetry the fetch if the tool comes back online, or proceed with an alternate plan.

Options to proceed
1) Retry now (or after a short moment)
   - I’ll try the Reddit data fetch again and, once it succeeds, I’ll deliver a full, detailed report with sentiment by day, top themes, and the latest news, plus a consolidated trading-context view for traders.

2) Proceed without live Reddit data (structured framework)
   - I can provide a thorough analysis framework and a best-effort interpretation based on publicly available signals, but I won’t be able to quote or summarize Reddit posts until the data tool is working. I’ll still cover:
     - sentiment framing (what to look for on social channels)
     - how to weigh Reddit sentiment against official company news (products, earnings, macro factors)
     - risk factors and trading implications
     - a detailed, end-of-report Markdown table to organize key points

3) Alternate data sources
   - If you have access to other data feeds (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, StockTwits, major news headlines), I can integrate those once you provide them, and still produce the comprehensive report.

What I’ll deliver once data is available
- A comprehensive long report detailing:
  - Daily sentiment: positive, negative, neutral distribution for the past 7–10 days, with day-by-day movement
  - Top themes across posts (e.g., product momentum, supply chain, services ecosystem, AI/AR, regulatory concerns)
  - Notable posts or threads driving sentiment and any timestamps that align with price moves
  - Correlation with recent Apple news and headlines (product launches, earnings, regulatory updates, supply chain, macro news)
  - Implications for traders: how sentiment and news interaction may affect short-term moves, support/resistance levels to watch, and risk factors
  - A set of granular takeaways and potential trading scenarios (e.g., scenarios where sentiment-driven moves may amplify earnings expectations, or where sentiment diverges from fundamentals)
- A Makrdown table at the end summarizing key points for quick reference

Proposed Makrdown table structure (example)
- Date | Sentiment (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral) | Key Themes | Apparent Drivers | Potential Trading Implications | Notes

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
- Proceed with the structured framework without live Reddit data (and I’ll clearly flag data as pending until the tool comes back online), or
- Use any alternate data sources you specify?

If you want me to retry, I can attempt again immediately and then deliver the full report as soon as the data tool returns usable results.
