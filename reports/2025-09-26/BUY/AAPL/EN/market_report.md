I ran into a data retrieval error trying to fetch AAPL data and the associated indicator calculations. Specifically, the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) for the data source, which means I can’t generate the requested indicators or a detailed report right now. If you’d like, I can retry immediately or try an alternate approach (different date range, simpler subset of indicators, or a cached/alternate data source if you have one).

What I can do next (once data access is restored):
- Fetch the price history for AAPL from 2024-09-26 to 2025-09-26 (or another window you specify).
- Compute up to 8 complementary indicators to give a well-rounded view of trend, momentum, and volatility.
- Deliver a detailed, nuanced report with actionable nuances for trading decisions.
- Append a Markdown table at the end summarizing the key observations and takeaways.

Recommended 8-indicator combination (complementary, non-redundant):
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend confirmation, helps identify golden/death cross contexts.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum; helps spot quick shifts.
- macd: Momentum crossovers and potential trend-change signals.
- macds: MACD signal line for crossovers with MACD, adds confirmation.
- macdh: MACD histogram to visualize momentum strength and divergence tendencies.
- rsi: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold cues; watch for divergences.
- atr: Volatility level to inform stop placement and risk management.

Why this set is suitable:
- Combines trend (50/200 SMA), short-term momentum (10 EMA, MACD family), momentum strength (RSI, MACD histogram), and volatility/risk context (ATR).
- Avoids redundancy (RSI vs Stoch RSI not included; MACD family provides momentum signals with multiple components).
- Covers both directional bias and potential entry/exit timing, while maintaining risk controls through volatility measurement.

What you’ll get in the full report (when data is available):
- A granular narrative of the current price regime for AAPL, including:
  - Trend alignment: Do the 50-day and 200-day SMAs align with price action? Any recent crossovers?
  - Momentum posture: How MACD, MACD signal, and MACD histogram are behaving; any bullish/bearish momentum changes?
  - Price action vs momentum: RSI direction relative to price trend; any divergences suggesting reversals or continuations?
  - Volatility context: ATR levels relative to recent moves; implications for position sizing and stop placement.
  - Short-term dynamics: 10-EMA in relation to price and its interaction with the longer-term trend.
- Trade-contextual insights:
  - Potential setup scenarios (trend continuation, pullback entry, or trend reversal) depending on indicator confluence.
  - Risk management notes (appropriate stop distances using ATR, expected volatility regime).
- A concise, decision-oriented conclusion with suggested actions (e.g., watch, entries on pullbacks, or exits on confirmations).

Awaiting your instruction:
- Do you want me to retry the data retrieval now with the same parameters?
- Or would you prefer I adjust any of the following:
  - Time window (e.g., last 90 days, YTD, or a custom period)
  - Indicator set (e.g., include Bollinger components like boll_ub/boll_lb instead of RSI)
  - A different symbol or date as a fallback?

In the meantime, here is a placeholder structure of the final report I will deliver once data is retrieved. I’ll replace the placeholders with actual values and interpretations when the data access issue is resolved.

Planned indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Sample structure of the forthcoming detailed report (sections with placeholders)
- Overview: Summary of price action regime for AAPL over the selected window.
- Trend Analysis: Position and interaction of price with 50SMA and 200SMA; current crossovers and whether the trend is bullish, bearish, or range-bound.
- Momentum Analysis: MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram; RSI posture and any observed divergences.
- Volatility & Risk: ATR levels, recent volatility bursts, and implications for sizing and stop placement.
- Short-Term Dynamics: 10 EMA behavior relative to price and potential entry points.
- Consolidated View: Confluence checks and likely scenario paths (bullish continuation, pullback/retest, or reversal).
- Trade Implications: Actionable notes for entries, exits, stops, and targets based on the observed confluence.
- Key Takeaways: Bullet-point conclusions to guide next steps.

If you’d like, I can proceed with a retry now and then deliver the full, data-driven report as soon as the data fetch succeeds. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.
