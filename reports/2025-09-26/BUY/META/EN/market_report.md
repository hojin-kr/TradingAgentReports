I attempted to fetch META data for the timeframe 2024-09-26 to 2025-09-26, but the data retrieval backend returned a FileNotFoundError. Because I don’t have a usable price series right now, I can’t generate a current trend report or compute the indicators from actual values. Here are two ways we can proceed:

- Option A: Retry data retrieval now (or after a short delay) to obtain a clean price series, then generate a full, data-driven trend report with all indicators.
- Option B: If you can provide a CSV or paste the price data (date, open, high, low, close, volume) for META for the period, I’ll compute the indicators immediately and deliver the full analysis.

In the meantime, I can still propose a robust, complementary set of indicators to use (up to 8) and explain how they would inform decisions once you have the data. This set is chosen to cover trend, momentum, volatility, and volume without redundancy.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming ongoing trend and spotting pullbacks in a broader uptrend or downtrend.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps identify major regime shifts (golden/death cross signals) and provides a macro-context bias.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Short-term momentum signal. More responsive to recent price action; useful for timing around longer-term trend when used with 50/200 SMA.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: Core momentum indicator. Crossover of MACD line with its signal provides a primary momentum-based entry/exit cue; works well in conjunction with trend filters.
- macds
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: MACD Signal line. Crossovers with MACD line refine signals from the MACD itself and help reduce false positives.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Rationale: Momentum strength and potential reversal signals (overbought/oversold). Useful for identifying divergences when price action aligns or diverges from momentum.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Rationale: Volatility-based risk management. Helps set position sizing and stop-loss placement; adapts to changing market volatility.
- vwma
  - Category: Volume-Based Indicators
  - Rationale: Volume-confirmed trend (volume-weighted MA). Adds a layer of confirmation that price swings are supported by volume, reducing false signals in low-liquidity regimes.

How these indicators work together (conceptual how-to once you have data)
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma together. If price is above both and 50_SMA is above 200_SMA, that’s a bullish macro-trend bias. If price is below both with 50_SMA below 200_SMA, consider a bearish macro-trend bias.
- Momentum timing: Use macd and macds to assess momentum. A MACD bullish crossover above the signal line reinforces a bullish tilt suggested by price trading above key moving averages. A bearish crossover below the signal line reinforces a downside tilt.
- Short-term momentum: RSI provides a quick view of overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals, especially when price action is also aligned with the MA trend.
- Volatility risk management: ATR informs stop placement and position sizing. Rising ATR suggests wider stop distances and potentially larger position sizing adjustments; falling ATR suggests tighter stops.
- Volume-confirmed moves: VWMA adds a confirmation layer to price moves. If price advances on higher VWMA-relative volume, it strengthens the case for continuation; if volume dries up, it can warn of a possible pullback or reversal.

Nuanced interpretation guidelines for META (without a data run)
- If META is trading above 50_SMA and 200_SMA, with a positive MACD and MACD signal, RSI not in extreme overbought territory, ATR rising moderately, and price rising with VWMA support, the constructive case favors continuation or a managed long entries with protective stops.
- If price crosses above 50_SMA but remains below 200_SMA, with MACD bullish but RSI approaching overbought, expect potential pullbacks toward 50_SMA or VWMA-supported levels; use ATR to gauge stop distances.
- In a high-volatility regime (rising ATR) with price testing Bollinger bands or upper bands, rely more on MACD/momentum cues and VWMA to discriminate true breakouts from noise.
- In range-bound or choppy markets, expect RSI to bounce between ~30 and ~70, MACD/Signal to show mixed signals, and ATR to stay low; use VWMA for subtle volume-supported breakouts and tighter risk management.

Proposed next steps
1) Retry data retrieval for META. If the system persists with the same error, consider providing a local price CSV so I can compute the indicators immediately.
2) If you prefer, I can proceed with a templated analysis once data is obtained, delivering:
   - A detailed narrative of trend direction, momentum strength, volatility, and volume dynamics.
   - A cross-indicator synthesis to flag high-probability setups and risk considerations.
   - A final concise table (as requested) outlining the key signals from each indicator and their implications for META.

Appendix: indicator overview table (to be populated with real data)
- Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to act on signals
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Mid-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below as trend filter; pullbacks to 50_SMA for potential entries
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend, macro regime | Crosses with 50_SMA; trend bias confirmation
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Quick momentum shifts; use for timing with longer MA trend
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum trend, directional strength | Crossover with MACD signal as entry/exit cue
- macds | MACD Related | Momentum signal smoothing | Validate MACD moves; reduce false positives
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold, momentum strength | Divergences and threshold crossings for reversals
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility and risk thresholds | Stop placement and position sizing adjustments
- vwma | Volume-Based Indicators | Price action aligned with volume | Volume-confirmed moves; filter out low-volume signals

Note: I currently don’t have a usable price series for META to generate the concrete trend narrative. If you want, I can retry the data pull now, or you can share data, and I’ll deliver the full, data-driven analysis with the 8 indicators above and a final table of key points.
