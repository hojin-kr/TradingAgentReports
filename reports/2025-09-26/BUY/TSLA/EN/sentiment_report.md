Thanks for the nudge. I’m running into a tool error right now.

What happened
- The get_reddit_stock_info tool is returning a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) for TSLA on 2025-09-26, despite multiple tries. It looks like an environment issue rather than user input error.

Immediate options to proceed
- Option A: Retry later—I'll automatically retry the Reddit/news sentiment retrieval and then produce the full long-form TSLA report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: If you’d like to move forward now, I can deliver a high-quality, best-effort TSLA analysis using non-tool sources (publicly known themes, general sentiment indicators, and macro context) and clearly label it as not pulling from the latest Reddit data. Then I’ll slot in the tool data as soon as the error is resolved and update the report.

What I can deliver right away regardless
- A structured framework for the full TSLA report, so once data is available, I can fill in every section quickly.
- Key risk factors and trader implications based on current widely-known themes for TSLA (as of late-September 2025), with caveats about data recency.

Proposed outline of the long report (to be filled with data once the tool works)
- Executive snapshot
  - Sentiment tilt (overall bullish/bearish/mixed)
  - Key catalysts from the past week
  - Net impact on risk/volatility
- Daily sentiment trajectory (last 7 days)

  - Financials (guidance, margins, guidance tweaks)

  - Consequences for sentiment and trading
- Price action and market reaction
  - Correlation of sentiment shifts with TSLA price and volatility
  - Options signal context (where available)
- Risk assessment and scenarios
  - Bull case, base case, bear case
  - Key data points to watch next (deliveries, margins, capex, AI milestones)
- Trader guidance and actionable takeaways
  - Any approaching catalysts and likely sentiment inflection points
  - Suggested positioning approach depending on risk tolerance

Proposed Markdown table (to be filled with results once data is in)
| Section | Key Observations | Data Source | Implications for Traders | Next Steps / Triggers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sentiment Tilt | e.g., bullish bias with spikes on new product updates | Reddit/News mentions (to be populated) | Potential short-term upside, watch for consolidation risk | Monitor next product/news catalyst |
| Daily Sentiment (Past 7 days) | Day-by-day sentiment scores | [Data source] | Gauge momentum and risk of whipsaw | Revisit after next data pull |
| Top Themes | e.g., FSD progress, production cadence | [Data] | Identify thematic bets vs. price action | Track official updates on FSD/high-velocity releases |
| News Highlights | 3–5 headlines with impact | [Source] | Determine sentiment drivers | Pre-earnings and catalyst watch |
| Price Action & Vol | Correlation with sentiment | [Price, VIX, etc.] | Infer regime (risk-on vs risk-off) | Look for divergence signals |
| Risk Scenarios | bull/base/bear | | | Update as new data arrives |

How would you like to proceed?
- If you’re okay with Option A, I’ll retry automatically and deliver the full long report with the Markdown table as soon as the data comes through.
- If you prefer Option B, I’ll produce the best-effort, non-tool-based analysis now and append the tool-derived insights later.

Either way, I’ll ensure the final output is thorough, trader-focused, and includes clear implications and actionable takeaways.
