Status: I attempted to fetch TSLA data and run the indicators, but the data service is returning a FileNotFoundError. Specifically:
- get_YFin_data calls for TSLA (2024-09-01 to 2025-09-26) failed with FileNotFoundError.
- Parallel requests to get_stockstats_indicators_report for TSLA also returned the same FileNotFoundError.

What this means
- I can’t produce the live TSLA indicator readings or a current trend analysis right now.
- Once the data source/module is accessible again, I will fetch the data and generate the 8 selected indicators, then deliver a detailed, nuanced report with actionable insights.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) for TSLA, designed to provide complementary insights
Rationale:
- TSLA is typically volatile with significant swings; a mix of short-term momentum, medium-term trend, volatility context, and volume-style confirmation helps filter noisy signals.
- The set below avoids redundancy and covers momentum, trend confirmation, volatility, and breakout context.

Selected indicators (exact names as required)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- boll_ub
- boll_lb

What I’ll analyze once data is available
- Short-term momentum vs price vs 10 EMA to detect swift shifts.
- Medium-term trend direction with 50 SMA to confirm the prevailing trend context.
- MACD and MACD Signal to identify momentum changes and crossovers for potential entries/exits.
- RSI to gauge momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions, with attention to divergences.
- Bollinger middle (boll) as a dynamic baseline, plus upper (boll_ub) and lower (boll_lb) bands to spot volatility regimes, breakout zones, and pullbacks.

How to interpret signals (high-level)
- If price is above 10 EMA and 50 SMA, and MACD is positive with MACD > MACD Signal, consider a bullish tilt; confirm with RSI not in overbought extreme.
- When price hugs or breaks above boll_ub with rising MACD and price above 50 SMA, watch for a potential breakout continuation; verify with RSI to avoid overbought traps.
- If price trades near boll_lb with RSI near or below 30 and MACD showing positive momentum reversal, consider a potential reversal/mean-reversion setup.
- Crosses of MACD above/below zero together with a 10 EMA cross can signal short-term momentum shifts; use 50 SMA as trend filter.
- A sustained move with price holding above 50 SMA and above boll_ub after a period of consolidation could indicate a trend continuation; use ATR to gauge stop placement (not part of the 8-indicator set, but recommended for risk management).

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval now or at a specified time. Once the data is accessible, I’ll produce:
  - A detailed narrative on the current TSLA setup, including trend direction, momentum, volatility regime, and potential risk/entry levels.
  - A concise set of actionable trading ideas aligned with the indicators (e.g., setup names like “trend continuation above 50 SMA with MACD bullish confirmation,” “mean-reversion near boll LB with RSI support,” etc.).
  - A Markdown table summarizing the key points, one row per indicator with interpretation notes.

Key points for quick reference (structure you’ll get in the final report)
- Trend direction by 50 SMA and price position
- Short-term momentum via 10 EMA and MACD crossings
- Momentum strength and over-extension via RSI
- Volatility and breakout context via Bollinger bands (middle, upper, lower)

Markdown table (expected final format to organize key points)
| Indicator | Role / Insight | What to Look For | Trading Interpretation (Baseline) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price crossing above/below 10 EMA; position relative to price | Bullish momentum if price above 10 EMA and turning higher; bearish if below and rolling lower |
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend confirmation | Price position relative to 50 SMA; any crossovers | Uptrend when price stays above 50 SMA; potential pullback entries near the SMA |
| macd | Momentum trend changes | MACD line vs MACD Signal; crossovers; zero line | Buy/sell signals when MACD crosses MACD Signal; confirm with price and other indicators |
| macds | MACD signal filter | MACD Signal line behavior; cross with MACD | Use cross with MACD to filter entries; helps reduce false signals |
| rsi | Momentum strength / reversal clues | RSI level (30/70 thresholds); divergences | Overbought/oversold cues; look for bullish/bearish divergences in context of trend |
| boll | Bollinger middle line | Price relative to Boll middle; baseline dynamics | Use as a dynamic support/resistance; trend context when price stays above/below boll |
| boll_ub | Upper band context | Interaction with upper band; band squeezes/expands | Breakouts or overbought zone signals when price rides or breaches boll_ub |
| boll_lb | Lower band context | Interaction with lower band; reversal signals near lower band | Potential oversold pullbacks or mean-reversion setups when near boll_lb |

Would you like me to retry fetching TSLA data now or on a scheduled retry? If you prefer, I can also switch to a lighter, single-indicator scan (e.g., MACD + RSI) as a quick interim view once the data service is back, and then scale up to the full 8-indicator framework when available.
