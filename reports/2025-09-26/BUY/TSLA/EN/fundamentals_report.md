Apologies — I attempted to fetch the latest data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SIMFIN balance sheet/cashflow/income stmt for TSLA) but ran into a FileNotFoundError in the data retrieval tools. It looks like the data services are currently unavailable from my environment. I can retry automatically, or you can choose to proceed with a qualitative framework now and I’ll fill in the numeric details as soon as the data tools are accessible again.

What I can do right now
- Provide a rigorous structure for the fundamental report you’ll get, including exactly where numbers will go and what insights to extract.
- When the data tools come back online, I will populate all sections with the latest quarterly data, insider sentiment, insider transactions, and balance sheet/cashflow/income statements, plus a concise trading-focused interpretation.

Proposed plan (once data tools are available)
1) Company profile and context
   - Business model, segments (Automotive, Energy, Services), geographic footprint, strategic initiatives (AI, software, energy storage, Robo-taxis, etc.).
2) Core financial snapshot (quarterly)
   - Revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, EBITDA (and margins).
   - Cash flow from operations, capex, free cash flow.
   - Balance sheet highlights: cash and equivalents, debt (short and long-term), working capital, equity.
   - Key profitability and liquidity ratios (gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROE, ROA, EV/EBITDA where applicable, cash ratio, current ratio, leverage).
3) Financial history and trend analysis
   - Quarterly/annual trend lines for revenue growth, margin expansion or contraction, FCF trajectory, debt levels.
   - Any notable one-time items, impairments, or restructuring costs.
4) Insiders: sentiment and transactions (past 15 days)
   - Insider sentiment summary (tone and direction of filings).
   - Notable insider transactions (big buys/sells, percentages of holdings, concentrations).
   - Interpret potential signals in the context of recent company news.
5) Cash flow and balance sheet deep dive
   - Working capital dynamics, free cash flow quality, cash conversion cycle (if data allows).
   - Debt maturity profile, interest coverage, liquidity runway.
6) Risk and qualitative notes
   - Competitive landscape (EV market, supply chain, battery technology, pricing power).
   - Regulatory, macro, and commodity risk (battery materials, energy policy, tariffs).
   - Operational risks (manufacturing scale, model ramp, Autopilot software, software/services monetization).
7) Trading-focused takeaways
   - What the data implies for earnings quality, cash generation, and insider signal alignment.
   - Potential catalysts or warning flags in the near term (product launches, capacity expansion, regulatory developments).

Proposed Markdown table (structure to append at the end of the report)

Next steps
- If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now, say “Retry now,” and I will reattempt all tool calls in parallel or sequence as appropriate.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, number-free analysis for now and populate numbers as soon as the data tools are back online.

Would you like me to retry the data fetch immediately, or proceed with the qualitative framework and placeholders until the data is available?
