Based on the provided investment plan and current market dynamics around AMD, the most consistent decision remains to favor a bearish stance with risk-managed hedging.

Decision
- SELL with a hedged/defined-risk approach. The near-term downside risks (inventory overhang, margin pressure, macro IT spend sensitivity) and Nvidia’s ongoing moat create a clearer risk-reward tilt to the downside than a near-term durable upside.

Rationale (why this fits the plan)
- Near-term catalysts are fragile: data-center growth lags Nvidia, margins are vulnerable to cost pressures, and macro demand for IT spend is uncertain.
- The bull case depends on multiple uncertain catalysts aligning in a short window (durable design wins, ASP/margin uplift, inventory normalization) which are not yet evident.
- A hedged bearish position allows participation in downside scenarios while limiting outright risk if sentiment shifts.

Recommended execution (concrete steps)
- Option-based path (preferred for defined risk):
  - Establish a defined-risk bearish setup using options (bear put spread). Buy AMD puts at a reasonably OTM strike (e.g., 5–15% below current price) with a 2–4 month expiry, and sell a higher-strike OTM put to finance the position. This caps upfront premium while providing meaningful downside exposure if AMD weakens.
  - If volatility/availability makes spreads unattractive, consider buying at-the-money or slightly OTM puts with a 2–4 month horizon, but be mindful of time decay.
  - Apply a trailing risk management rule: trim/roll into tighter puts if AMD nears a defined resistance on strong volume, especially ahead of catalysts.
- Cash/stock path (if options are not used):
  - Initiate a small short position with strict risk controls (e.g., stop on close above a defined resistance or key moving average cross). Use a collar to finance protection with upside capped by selling calls at a higher strike.
- Risk sizing and controls:
  - Limit risk to 0.5–1.5% of portfolio per trade; keep total theme risk to 3–5%.
  - Use ATR-based sizing to adjust exposure during high-volatility periods.
- Timing and catalysts to watch:
  - Be cautious around earnings and AI roadmap updates; avoid initiating near imminent catalysts that could swing sentiment violently.
  - Monitor hyperscaler capex signals, data-center demand indicators, and any updates on inventory/margin trajectory.
- Exit plan:
  - Primary exit if AMD breaks above a defined resistance with confirming momentum signals (risk control to protect against acceleration in the bull case).
  - If the position drifts unfavorably, consider rolling or tightening hedges; re-evaluate on a 6–8 week horizon or sooner if major data shifts occur.

Learnings and discipline
- Do not chase optimism around AI tailwinds without several converging data points confirming durable upside.
- Maintain explicit risk controls, scenario-based planning, and disciplined exit triggers to avoid letting a single catalyst dictate the entire stance.

Bottom line
- The bear case remains more robust in the near term given current dynamics; a hedged/defined-risk short approach offers favorable risk-reward relative to a flat or long stance. If AMD can demonstrate durable data-center growth and margin stabilization in the next 6–12 months, the stance can be reassessed toward Hold or Buy with a data-confirmed thesis.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
