Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to pull the data and run the indicators for AMD, but the data retrieval layer returned a FileNotFoundError for all the requested indicators. It looks like an environment issue with the data files rather than a market signal problem. I can retry the data pull now, or we can proceed with a qualitative, data-free framework and then fill in the actual numbers as soon as the data fetch succeeds. How would you like to proceed?

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) and why they’re suitable for AMD
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend direction and serves as dynamic support/resistance. For AMD, this can help gauge the persistence of any rally or pullback in the recent cycle.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. A long-term trend benchmark to confirm macro directional bias (bullish/bearish) and to watch for golden/death-cross setups. Useful for strategic positioning in a volatile semis environment.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. A responsive short-term momentum lens to catch quick shifts in AMD’s price action, especially around earnings or AI-cycle catalysts.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum oscillator derived from EMA differences; crossovers can signal shifts in trend strength. Helpful for confirming momentum alongside price action.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoothing of the MACD; its crossovers with MACD itself can help filter false signals in range-bound or choppy periods.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and divergence potential; useful for spotting early momentum changes in fast-moving periods.
- rsi: Relative Strength Index. Momentum gauge with usual overbought/oversold frames; watch for divergences or extreme readings that coincide with trend context.
- atr: Average True Range. A volatility gauge; instrumental for setting risk controls (stops, position sizing) and adapting to changing volatility regimes in AMD’s often volatile price action.

High-level interpretive framework you can apply once data is in
- Trend frame
  - Price trading above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA generally indicates a bullish backdrop; look for 10 EMA pullbacks toward the 50 SMA as potential entries in uptrends.
  - If price sits between 50 and 200 SMA or near them, use MACD/MACD Histogram to assess whether momentum supports continuation or warns of a potential pullback.
- Momentum and timing
  - MACD cross above the signal line (MACD > MACDS) and MACD Histogram turning positive are bullish signals; negative crossovers suggest weakness or a pause in the uptrend.
  - RSI above 60-70 with price respecting the trend can indicate healthy upside momentum; RSI divergence (price higher, RSI lower) warns of potential weakening.
- Volatility and risk management
  - ATR rising suggests expanding volatility; consider wider stops or smaller position sizing, especially around catalysts (earnings, AI roadmap updates).
  - If ATR compresses while price remains range-bound, expect potential breakouts; corroborate with MACD and price action around the 50/200 SMAs.
- Confluence and risk controls
  - A confluence of price above 50/200 SMA, MACD bullish signal, RSI not overbought, and rising ATR could indicate a higher-probability continuation setup.
  - Conversely, price below 50 SMA with MACD turning down and RSI failing to push higher could imply a higher risk of a trend reversal or deeper pullback.

Notes and caveats
- AMD is sensitive to AI cycle dynamics, data-center demand, and competitive positioning (e.g., competition with Nvidia and other accelerators). Market sentiment can drive rapid moves; combine these indicators with event awareness (earnings, product launches, supply chain news).
- The eight-indicator lineup aims to balance trend (SMAs/EMA), momentum (MACD family + RSI), and risk (ATR) without overloading on redundancy.
- Once data is retrieved, I’ll produce a detailed, data-grounded interpretation for the exact window (2024-09-26 to 2025-09-26 or your preferred range) and deliver a formatted report with concrete signals and a decision recommendation.

What I can do next
- Option A: Retry data retrieval now and then deliver the full, data-driven report with concrete signal readings and a buy/hold/sell stance if warranted.
- Option B: Proceed with a fully qualitative framework (as above) and deliver the final report immediately, then update with data-driven specifics as soon as the pull succeeds.
- Option C: Narrow the data window (e.g., last 6–9 months) to increase the chance of a successful data fetch and provide an interim analysis.

Would you like me to retry the data pull now, or would you prefer I proceed with the qualitative framework and then update with live data as soon as it’s available?

Markdown table: key points to track (to be filled with real data once available)
| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for AMD | Signal examples (when data is present) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day trend base | Trend direction; support/resistance level | Price above/below 50 SMA; pullbacks toward 50 SMA |
| close_200_sma | 200-day trend base | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above/below 200 SMA; golden/death cross hints |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts in momentum | Price crossing above/below 10 EMA; consolidation near EMA |
| macd | Momentum momentum (MACD line) | Trend strength and direction | MACD cross above/below signal; histogram changes |
| macds | MACD signal line | Smoothing of momentum signals | Crossovers with MACD line confirm/reject signals |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum acceleration/deceleration | Histogram rising/falling; divergence with price |
| rsi | Relative momentum | Overbought/oversold context; divergence | RSI >70/ <30; bullish/bearish divergence |
| atr | Volatility magnitude | Risk sizing and stop placement | ATR rising/falling; adapt position sizing and stops |

If you’d like, I can retry the data pull immediately and then deliver a full data-driven AMD report once the data is retrieved.
