Sorry about that—the Reddit stock info tool is returning a FileNotFoundError right now, so I can’t fetch Reddit-based sentiment at the moment.

I can proceed in one of two ways:
- Option A: Retry Reddit data later (I can keep trying and pull in-depth Reddit sentiment once the tool is working).
- Option B: Move forward with a comprehensive AMD analysis using other sources (official news, press releases, earnings notes, and sentiment from platforms other than Reddit such as X/Twitter, StockTwits, forums, etc.). I’ll deliver a detailed traders-focused report with fine-grained insights and a final markdown table.

Which would you prefer? If you want, I can start now with Option B and provide a thorough AMD sentiment/news analysis, plus a structured table at the end.
