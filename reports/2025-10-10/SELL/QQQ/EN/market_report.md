I tried to fetch QQQ data with the provided tool, but the data retrieval failed with a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). This seems to be an environment/tool issue rather than something about QQQ itself. I can retry or proceed with a best-effort analysis using the planned indicator set, and we can run the data fetch again as soon as the data tool is available. If you’d like, I can also try a different date range or shorter window to see if the issue is range-related.

Given the need to start with a robust, complementary set of indicators, here are the 8 indicators I recommend for QQQ (to cover trend, momentum, and volatility with volume context):

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_200_sma
- close_50_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- vwma

Why these are suitable for QQQ
- close_200_sma: Establishes the long-term trend view for the NASDAQ-100 tracking ETF. Useful to confirm whether the market is in a broad uptrend or downtrend, which informs the risk stance and entry timing.
- close_50_sma: Adds a mid-term trend perspective and helps identify intermediate support/resistance zones. Crosses with the 200SMA (when visible) can signal longer-term trend changes.
- close_10_ema: Provides a responsive read on near-term momentum and can help time entries or exits in a choppy market when used with longer-term averages for filtering.
- macd: Core momentum/trend change signal. MACD line crossovers can precede price accelerations or reversals, especially in tech-heavy moves typical for QQQ.
- macds: The MACD signal line; its crossovers with MACD help generate clearer entry/exit signals and reduce false positives from raw MACD.
- macdh: Momentum strength via the MACD histogram. Useful to gauge expanding or waning momentum and to spot divergences when prices push to new levels.
- rsi: A classic momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. In strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated; in range-bound phases it can help identify shifts when used with price structure.
- vwma: Volume-confirmed trend direction. Since QQQ is tech-heavy and often experiences volume-driven moves, VWMA helps validate price moves with corresponding volume support, reducing reliance on price action alone.

How this set helps in practice (nuanced view)
- Trend vs. momentum balance: The 200SMA and 50SMA give you a layered trend view, while the 10EMA keeps you attuned to immediate momentum shifts. If price remains above both SMAs, you’d expect more sustained upside, with MACD and VWMA confirming momentum and volume-backed moves.
- Signals vs. noise: MACD and its components (macd, macds, macdh) provide a broader picture of momentum direction, strength, and potential divergence. When RSI is in extreme zones but price is already trending, rely more on the MACD/volume signals to avoid overreacting to overbought/oversold readings.
- Volume context: VWMA helps confirm whether a move is supported by actual participation. In QQQ, where institutional flows can drive large moves, VWMA confirmation can differentiate genuine breakouts from false breakouts.
- Risk management: With the RSI and momentum signals, you can calibrate entries to align with the prevailing trend, and use MACD histogram shifts to avoid chasing momentum that may be peaking.

Next steps
- I can re-run the data fetch as soon as the data tool is available or if you’d like I can try a narrower date window or a smaller date range to see if that resolves the error.
- Once data is retrieved, I’ll generate a concise, actionable report on QQQ with the 8 indicators, including signal interpretations, potential entry/exit ideas, and a quick risk checklist.

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and interpretation in QQQ context

| Indicator | What it measures | How to interpret for QQQ | Trade signal considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above suggests long-term uptrend; below suggests downtrend | Use for trend confirmation before taking long/short positions |
| close_50_sma | Mid-term trend | Price above/below indicates intermediate trend direction | Cross with 200SMA can signal trend changes; use with momentum filters |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Quick shifts in momentum; reacts fast to price moves | Use to time entries in conjunction with longer-term signals; beware of noise |
| macd | Momentum/trend change (MACD line) | Crosses above/below signal line indicate momentum shifts | Crossovers can trigger entries/exits; confirm with price level and VWMA |
| macds | MACD signal line | Signal line crossovers refine MACD signals | Use with MACD crossovers to reduce false positives |
| macdh | MACD histogram strength | Magnitude shows momentum strength/weakening | Expanding histogram supports continuation; shrinking hints potential reversal |
| rsi | Relative momentum | Overbought/oversold levels, potential reversals | Extreme RSI in uptrends requires caution; verify with trend and volume |
| vwma | Volume-weighted trend confirmation | Price moves supported by high VWMA-fueled volume are stronger | Use to validate breakouts or pullbacks with volume support |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now or adjust the plan (e.g., choose a different set of indicators or swap macd/macds/macdh for another indicator like atr or boll if you prefer). Please tell me how you’d like to proceed.
