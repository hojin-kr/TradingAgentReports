Decision: Primary stance is to SELL or meaningfully reduce QQQ/mega-cap exposure now, with hedges and a defensive rotation.

Rationale (why this aligns with the provided plan and current risk signals)
- Concentration and breadth risk: QQQ’s exposure is heavily weighted to a few mega-caps; a negative turn in one or two names can disproportionately impact the ETF.
- Macro/regime sensitivity: Higher-for-longer rates and inflation surprises can compress tech valuations and punishing multiples, especially if AI ROI narratives underwhelm.
- Potential for mean re-pricing: The bear case highlights that valuations may be ahead of durable earnings acceleration, increasing downside risk if macro conditions shift or AI-driven benefits don’t materialize quickly.
- Signals beyond a single narrative: Despite a bullish multi-indicator setup, regime shifts, breadth deterioration, or data gaps can invalidate signals and lead to sharp reversals.

Implementation plan (condensed, actionable)
1) Reduce exposure
- Trim QQQ/mega-cap overweight to neutral or modest underweight, proportional to risk budget and current positioning.

2) Implement hedges
- Use protective puts on QQQ with short duration (1–2 months) targeting strikes near recent swing lows or modestly in-the-money to balance cost and protection.
- Alternatively, allocate a modest sleeve to SQQQ as a tactical hedge to cap downside while preserving upside optionality.
- Consider put spreads to manage hedging costs if premium outlays are a concern.

3) Rotate defensively
- Reallocate trimmed capital into defensives (high-quality healthcare, staples, utilities) or cash equivalents to reduce beta and preserve capital.
- Maintain a quality/value tilt with higher visibility of earnings and stronger balance sheets.

4) Risk controls and exit rules
- Establish a hard stop on QQQ exposure if price closes below a defined risk line (e.g., 50SMA or recent swing low) with volume confirmation.
- Trigger quick scaling back if MACD/histogram deteriorates after a bullish setup or breadth deteriorates (fewer new highs, leadership concentration worsens).
- Schedule weekly reviews of macro data, rate expectations, and breadth indicators; be prepared to re-enter more aggressively only with regime confirmation.

5) Monitoring and data contingencies
- Prioritize price action, VWMA-driven volume, and macro catalysts (CPI, PCE, rate expectations) when sentiment data is unreliable.
- Revisit sentiment feeds and triangulate with multiple sources as data reliability improves.

6) Review and learning loop
- Document timing, hedge effectiveness, and sizing decisions to improve regime-aware risk management in future cycles.

Notes on tailoring
- If you’d like, I can tailor sizing, specific strike levels for protective puts, and an exact hedging ratio based on your current QQQ exposure, portfolio beta, and risk tolerance.
- I can also run a quick sensitivity scenario (e.g., a 10–20% QQQ drawdown with and without hedges) to quantify potential drawdowns and hedge payoffs.
