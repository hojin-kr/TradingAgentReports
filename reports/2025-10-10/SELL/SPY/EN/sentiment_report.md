I’m running into a tool issue fetching SPY Reddit data right now. The Reddit data fetch tool returned a FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory), so I can’t pull the latest sentiment data at the moment.

What I can do right now
- Retry the SPY Reddit data pull immediately to see if the issue is transient.
- If you prefer, switch to a fallback approach (e.g., proceed with the report structure and placeholders for sentiment until the data tool is back).
- Or wait a moment and I’ll attempt the fetch again automatically and then deliver the full sentiment/news analysis.

Recommended plan if you want me to proceed as soon as the tool is back
1) Fetch SPY sentiment from Reddit (latest 7 days, daily granularity) and extract:
   - daily sentiment scores (positive/negative/neutral)
   - top themes/keywords driving sentiment
   - notable posts or comments that shifted sentiment (e.g., spikes around macro news, ETF-related news)
2) Gather SPY-related news for the past week (headline and gist) and categorize as bullish/bearish/neutral.
3) Combine into a granular, trader-oriented analysis:
   - daily sentiment trend with spike analysis
   - correlation with price action (if data available)
   - key drivers (macro events, policy, earnings or ETF flows)
   - risk signals and potential follow-through catalysts
4) Deliver a detailed long-report with:
   - executive snapshot
   - sentiment breakdown by day
   - news pulse and its implications
   - themes and risk flags
   - trading implications and scenarios
5) Append a Markdown table at the end organizing the key takeaways and actionable points.

In the meantime, here is the structure I’ll produce once data is in, so you know what to expect (and I can fill in the data as soon as the tool works):

- Executive snapshot
  - Overall sentiment trend over past 7 days
  - Key sentiment hotspots
  - Immediate implications for SPY positioning (short-term bias)

- Social sentiment analysis (daily)
  - Date, sentiment score, top keywords, notable posts
  - Short commentary on what drove each day’s sentiment

- News pulse (past week)
  - Date, headline, summary, sentiment of the piece
  - How news aligns or contrasts with social sentiment

- Thematic drivers
  - Macro factors (rates, inflation, policy)
  - ETF-specific drivers (flows, options activity, rebalancing risk)
  - Sector/stock-level echoes that influenced SPY sentiment

- Trading implications
  - If sentiment is turning bullish: potential entry levels, risk controls
  - If sentiment is turning bearish: potential exit levels, hedges
  - Neutral periods and how to wait for a catalyst

- Risk considerations
  - Data limitations, sentiment noise, macro event risk

- Final takeaways and recommended watchlist for SPY

- Makrdown table (end of report)
  - A concise, readable table listing: Date, Sentiment, Top Themes, News Pulse, Implication, Recommended Action

Would you like me to retry fetching SPY Reddit data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the above plan and deliver the report structure (with placeholders) as soon as the tool is back? If you have a preference (e.g., focus on a specific time window within the past week, or include/exclude certain data sources), tell me and I’ll tailor it.
