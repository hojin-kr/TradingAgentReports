I tried to fetch AAPL data, but I hit a data-access error on the YFin data tool: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). It looks like the required CSV/data file isn’t available in the current environment, so I can’t compute the indicators right now. I can retry, try a different date range, or proceed with a recommended indicator set so we’re ready to run once the data tool is accessible. Please tell me which you prefer.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary insights for AAPL without overlap. These will give you a balanced view of trend, momentum, volatility, and volatility-adjusted context once the data can be loaded.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- rsi
- boll
- boll_ub
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for AAPL
- close_10_ema: Captures quick shifts in momentum; useful to spot early entry/exit signals in a stock known to move on news and catalysts.
- close_50_sma: Provides a medium-term trend view and dynamic support/resistance; helps filter noise when combined with faster signals.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm the overarching regime (bullish/bearish) and signals like golden/death cross when crossovers occur with other indicators.
- macd: Core momentum indicator; crossovers with the signal line and histogram shifts help gauge trend changes in a stock prone to large intraday moves.
- rsi: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold cues; useful for divergence checks in trending vs. range-bound conditions, which AAPL often experiences around product cycle catalysts.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-SMA) provides a dynamic benchmark for price movement; useful to assess reversion vs. breakout context when used with bands.
- boll_ub: Upper band signals potential overbought zones and breakout areas; signals are strongest when corroborated with momentum and price action.
- atr: Measures volatility to inform risk management, stop placement, and position sizing; particularly relevant for AAPL where volatility can swing with earnings, guidance, and macro news.

How to interpret signals once data is available
- Trend confirmation: If price is above all three moving averages (10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA) and the averages are ordered (10 EMA > 50 SMA > 200 SMA), be alert for sustained uptrends; look for MACD positive spillover and RSI trending ~50–70.
- Momentum signals: A MACD line cross above the signal line in conjunction with a rising RSI (>50) strengthens a bullish setup; a MACD cross below with RSI ~30–50 supports a bearish tilt.
- Volatility and breakout context: Rising ATR alongside price testing/breaking the boll_ub with positive MACD momentum could indicate a breakout continuation; if ATR falls while price hugs boll or the upper band, be cautious of a false breakout in low-vol regimes.
- Mean reversion cues: Price reversion toward boll middle after touching boll_ub (or boll_lb if you include it later) can indicate consolidation phases; use RSI and MACD to confirm whether pullbacks are likely to reverse or extend.
- Risk management: Use ATR to set dynamic stops (e.g., 1.5–2.0x ATR) and adjust position sizing based on current volatility.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now (or with a different date window, e.g., 2023-01-01 to 2025-10-10) to generate the eight indicators and produce a detailed, data-driven trend report.
- If you’d like me to proceed with the 8-indicator set above, please confirm and I’ll attempt the data fetch again and then deliver a full, data-backed analysis with a table of key observations.

Appendix: Key points at a glance (Markdown table)

| Indicator | Category | Purpose | What to look for |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Quick momentum and entry/exit timing | Price crosses above/below 10 EMA; use with 50 SMA and 200 SMA for confirmation |
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction | Price above/below 50 SMA; look for alignment with 10 EMA and 200 SMA |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend confirmation | Price above/below 200 SMA; observe for golden/death cross with shorter MA interactions |
| macd | MACD | Momentum and trend change signals | MACD line cross above/below signal line; histogram strength confirms trend |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold context | RSI >70 overbought or <30 oversold; watch for divergences with price/MA trends |
| boll | Bollinger Middle | Baseline for price movement; mean-reversion sense | Price relative to middle band indicates mean-reversion vs. breakout context |
| boll_ub | Bollinger Upper Band | Breakout/overbought context | Price approaching or breaking upper band; confirm with MACD/RSI for breakout validity |
| atr | Volatility | Risk management and stop placement | Rising ATR implies higher volatility (adjust stops); falling ATR implies consolidation |

If you want me to retry now, tell me to proceed with a new date range or default to 2023-01-01 through 2025-10-10, and I’ll run the data fetch and deliver a full indicator-driven report.
