I hit an error trying to fetch Reddit stock data for AAPL on 2025-10-10: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory). The data source tool appears unavailable at the moment. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

Options to proceed
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit stock data fetch again immediately in case the issue is temporary.
- Proceed with a best-effort framework: I’ll lay out a comprehensive long report structure, including sentiment analysis methodology, what I would look for once data is available, and placeholders for data-driven insights. This lets us move forward while awaiting data access.
- Use alternative sources (if you permit): I can synthesize a detailed qualitative analysis based on typical drivers for Apple (product news, earnings cadence, supply chain, regulatory developments, macro tech sentiment) and outline how those would translate into sentiment signals, risks, and trading implications once data is in.

What I will deliver once data is available (and what I’m ready to provide now as a framework)
- What I will look for:
  - Daily sentiment signals from Reddit posts and comments about AAPL over the past week (positive vs. negative vs. neutral, volume, notable subreddits, and top posts driving sentiment).
  - Correlated news events within the last 7 days (product announcements, earnings-related news, supply chain updates, legal/regulatory items, major tech industry happenings).
  - Market reaction indicators (brief correlations with AAPL price moves, options flow signals if available, mention of catalysts like iPhone launch cycles, services growth, AI-related investments, etc.).
- How I’ll translate sentiment into actionable insights:
  - Daily sentiment trend narrative with drivers for each day.
  - Key support/resistance levels implied by sentiment and any precursor price action.
  - Catalyst calendar and how upcoming events could shift sentiment.
  - Risk factors and potential mispricings (e.g., overextended optimism vs. undervalued pessimism).
- Trader-focused takeaways:
  - Short-term (intraday to 1-2 weeks): sentiment momentum, potential mean-reversion triggers, and risk management notes.
  - Medium-term (1-2 quarters): structural drivers (new product cycle, services growth, margin trajectory), and how sentiment aligns or diverges from fundamentals.
  - Scenarios with likely sentiment outcomes given plausible news/event catalysts.

Proposed report structure (to be populated with data when available)

  - One-line takeaway on current sentiment posture vs. price action and notable news in the last week.

- Trader-oriented takeaways
  - Scenarios, timing windows, and suggested positioning considerations.
- Appendices (optional)
  - Notes on data quality, subreddit taxonomy, notable sample posts (anonymized), and methodology details.

Markdown table: Key points (structure to fill once data is available)
If you’d like, here is a placeholder table you can expect to see populated with real data once the Reddit/news data fetch succeeds.

| Dimension | Details (to fill with data) | Interpretation / Trading Implications |
|---|---|---|
| Time window analyzed | Past 7 days (date range) | Baseline sentiment depth and recent catalysts |
| Overall sentiment (net) | Positive / Neutral / Negative | Quick read on mood and potential price direction bias |
| Daily sentiment trend | Day-by-day positives/negatives | Identify momentum shifts and breakout/breakdown signals |
| Top contributing posts (sample) | List of top 3 posts by impact | Understand drivers: product rumors, earnings expectations, etc. |
| Major news events | Headlines and quick impact score | Catalysts that could re-rate sentiment/price |
| Price action context | Price move vs. sentiment on each day | Detect divergences or confirmations |
| Key risk factors | What could invert sentiment | Regulatory, supply chain, competition, macro risks |
| Most probable catalysts next 1–2 weeks | Potential triggers | Trade ideas and risk-adjusted strategies |
| Suggested trader playbook | Bullets on entries/exits, stop levels, and risk controls | Actionable guidance aligned with sentiment signal |

Next steps
- I can retry the Reddit stock data fetch now. If it succeeds, I’ll synthesize a full, data-driven long report with a day-by-day sentiment breakdown, linked to recent news, and provide the final Markdown table of key points.
- Alternatively, if you prefer, I can deliver the framework as-is and begin filling in data as soon as the data source becomes available again.

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry the data fetch now, or proceed with the framework and placeholder analysis (and fill in data as soon as the tool works again)?
- If you want a partial fill right away, I can provide a qualitative, non-data-specific Apple sentiment snapshot for the last week based on typical drivers and recent Apple news, clearly labeled as illustrative until data is loaded.
