I ran into a system error retrieving the data for AAPL. The parallel tool calls returned FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the latest insider sentiment, insider transactions, or SimFin financial statements to build the comprehensive report yet.

What I can do right now
- Retry the data fetches immediately if you’d like.
- Alternatively, proceed with a structured, data-ready report once the data comes back, or use a manual baseline from public sources if you’re okay with that.

Proposed plan if you want me to retry now
- Re-run these in parallel:
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment (AAPL, 2025-10-10)
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions (AAPL, 2025-10-10)
  - get_simfin_balance_sheet (AAPL, quarterly, 2025-10-10)
  - get_simfin_income_stmt (AAPL, quarterly, 2025-10-10)
  - get_simfin_cashflow (AAPL, quarterly, 2025-10-10)

What the final comprehensive report will include
- Company profile and business overview
- Latest quarterly snapshot with key income, balance sheet, and cash flow figures
- Financial history and trend analysis (multiple quarters)
- Profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and leverage metrics
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days) and insider transactions (past 15 days)
- Trading implications and potential edge cases for traders
- Fine-grained insights and potential catalysts
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points

Would you like me to retry the data fetches now? If yes, I’ll run the tools again and then deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as they return. If you prefer, I can proceed with a partial report using any existing data you’re comfortable sharing or I can compile a framework now and fill in the numbers later.
