I attempted to fetch PLTR data from Yahoo Finance for 2024-10-01 to 2025-10-10, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend data path issue). I’m ready to retry now or can proceed with a structured indicator plan in parallel and run the data fetch again as soon as the backend is available. Here’s a detailed, ready-to-use plan for PLTR with a complementary set of up to 8 indicators.

Selected indicators (8, non-redundant, complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr
- vwma

Rationale for this set
- close_50_sma and close_200_sma: Provide a clear view of medium- to long-term trend direction and potential dynamic support/resistance levels. The 50-day SMA helps with mid-term timing, while the 200-day SMA offers strategic trend confirmation and potential golden/death-cross context.
- macd and macds: Together they reveal momentum and momentum shifts. The MACD line (macd) identifies convexity changes; the MACD signal (macds) helps confirm crossovers for more reliable entries/exits.
- rsi: Measures relative strength and momentum, helping to identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences when used with trend context.
- boll: The Bollinger middle (20 SMA) provides a volatility-adjusted baseline to compare price action against a dynamic mean. It helps assess breakout or mean-reversion pressure against a central tendency.
- atr: A volatility-driven measure to inform risk management, position sizing, and stop levels. Useful for adapting to changing market volatility in PLTR’s typically uneven price action.
- vwma: Volume-weighted view that confirms price action through trading activity. Helps validate breakouts or trend moves when volume aligns with price momentum.

How signals would be interpreted (workflow once data is available)
- Trend check with price vs moving averages:
  - Price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA suggests a bullish backdrop; choppiness or bearish action requires additional confirmation.
  - If 50 SMA crosses above 200 SMA (golden cross) with MACD bullish alignment, it strengthens the case for long entries.
- Momentum confirmation:
  - MACD line crossing above the signal line (macd > macds with a rising MACD) and positive histogram (macdh) supports upside momentum; look for RSI to stay in a non-extreme zone (not overbought) to avoid early exits in strong uptrends.
- RSI checks:
  - RSI rising from oversold toward mid-range supports a potential entry in a recovering trend.
  - If RSI hits overbought levels (e.g., above 70) while price remains above rising MA, consider tighter risk management or waiting for a pullback.
- Volatility and risk controls:
  - ATR rising indicates increasing volatility; adjust position size and stop levels accordingly.
  - Price trading near the Boll middle with squeeze-like behavior followed by a breakout (above boll or below boll) can signal a potential move; confirm with MACD and VWMA.
- Volume validation:
  - VWMA rising with price breaking out or rallying above key moving averages adds conviction; weak volume on a breakout warrants caution.

Trade-entry/exit framework (high-level)
- Long setup (Bullish bias):
  - Price above 50SMA and 200SMA; MACD bullish crossover; RSI not in overbought territory; price tests and holds above Boll middle; VWMA confirms with rising volume.
- Short/fade setup (Bearish or caution):
  - Price below 50SMA or 200SMA; MACD bearish or decelerating; RSI failing to sustain movement above mid-range; price tests resistance near Boll upper band with weak VWMA confirmation.
- Risk management:
  - Use ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.0–2.0x ATR) to adapt to current volatility; scale position sizes based on ATR and account risk limits.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the PLTR data via get_YFin_data right away if you’d like.
- If you prefer, we can proceed with the outlined 8-indicator plan immediately and I’ll generate a comprehensive, data-backed trend report as soon as the data tool returns results.
- If you want a different date window or additional indicators (e.g., including boll_ub/boll_lb for breakout/reversion signals), I can adjust the set accordingly.

| Topic | Indicator | Rationale / What it tells you | How to interpret signals (high level) | Trade considerations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trend context | close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and support/resistance | Price above 50SMA suggests uptrend; cross with 200SMA strengthens trend signal | Use as baseline for entries; pair with momentum |
| Trend context | close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above/below 200SMA indicates structural trend; golden/death cross adds conviction | Align longer-term bias with entry timing |
| Momentum | macd | Momentum shifts | Bullish crossover + rising histogram supports up-move; bearish opposite signals risk | Confirm with RSI and VWMA/volume |
| Momentum | macds | Smoother momentum signal | Cross or alignment with MACD reinforces momentum change | Use to filter noisy MACD signals |
| Momentum/Strength | rsi | Overbought/oversold and divergence | RSI rising from lows supports buying; divergence warns of reversals | Watch for extreme readings in strong trends |
| Volatility | boll | Central tendency and volatility context | Price around or above Boll middle indicates sustained moves; bands help spot breakouts | Use with MA and MACD for confirmation |
| Volatility/Stops | atr | Realistic volatility measure for risk | Higher ATR suggests wider stops; lower ATR allows tighter stops | Set stops and position sizing accordingly |
| Volume confirmation | vwma | Volume-adjusted price confirmation | Rising VWMA with price gains adds conviction; weak VWMA signals reduce edge | Prefer signals with volume support |
