Thanks for the ticker. I attempted to fetch NVDA data to run the indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data service is currently failing on this end. I can retry now or proceed with a detailed qualitative analysis based on the indicator framework and NVDA’s typical context while we wait for the data service to come back online. Please tell me if you want me to retry immediately or to proceed with the qualitative analysis first.

Proposed indicators (8) for NVDA and why they’re suitable
- close_50_sma
  - Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - NVDA context: Helps gauge the prevailing trend amidst volatile news cycles (AI demand, earnings). Useful to confirm trend direction when combined with other signals.
- close_200_sma
  - Role: Long-term trend benchmark and macro-trend confirmation.
  - NVDA context: Provides a strategic, higher-timeframe filter to avoid premature entries during choppy periods.
- close_10_ema
  - Role: Responsive short-term momentum.
  - NVDA context: Captures quick momentum shifts on earnings surprises, AI news, or sector rotations; helps with timely entries/exits when paired with longer-term trends.
- macd
  - Role: Momentum and trend-change signal via MACD line vs. signal line.
  - NVDA context: Useful for spotting shifts in momentum, especially around earnings or major product announcements; works best when corroborated with price action and other indicators.
- macds
  - Role: MACD signal line smoothing; crossovers can trigger signals with reduced noise.
  - NVDA context: Adds a filter for MACD crossovers to reduce false positives in volatile periods.
- macdh
  - Role: MACD histogram; momentum strength and divergence visualization.
  - NVDA context: Divergences between price and MACD histogram can foreshadow trend changes; helpful in high-volatility windows.
- rsi
  - Role: Momentum strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
  - NVDA context: Important for spotting exhaustion tops or catching reversals when momentum becomes extreme; best used with trend context to avoid false reversals in strong trends.
- vwma
  - Role: Volume-confirmed moving average; price action filtered by volume.
  - NVDA context: Nvidia often experiences surge in volume on earnings or AI news. VWMA helps validate breakouts or trend continuations with actual participation, reducing the weight of price moves that lack volume support.

How I would interpret signals (high-level rules) for NVDA
- Trend alignment check:
  - If close_50_sma is above close_200_sma (bullish alignment) and close_10_ema is above both, look for long entries that are supported by MACD momentum (macd > macds and macd histogram positive).
  - If close_50_sma is below close_200_sma (bearish alignment), prefer short or defensive plays unless MACD shows a strong up-move and RSI is not oversold.
- Momentum confirmation:
  - A bullish MACD cross (macd crossing above macds) with rising macdh, combined with RSI lifting from below 50 toward 60-70, strengthens a potential entry.
  - A bearish MACD cross with macdh turning negative and RSI trending toward or above 70 signals caution or potential reversal.
- Reversion and overextension checks:
  - RSI near overbought (>70) in a bullish trend should trigger caution; look for MACD/divergence signals and VWMA-supported price action for potential pullbacks rather than steep long entries.
  - RSI around or below 30 in a downtrend could indicate a potential short-term bounce if MACD momentum supports a counter-move, but confirm with VWMA and price structure.
- Volume-confirmed breakouts:
  - A price move beyond a recent high with VWMA rising and above price, alongside bullish MACD/histogram, is a stronger signal than price move alone.
- Risk management context:
  - Use ATR to gauge stop distances (not in the 8-indicator set here) and adjust position size; since ATR isn’t included in this 8-indicator set, ensure you apply a separate risk control measure in real trades if you’re implementing live.
- NVDA-specific considerations:
  - NVDA is highly reactive to AI demand news, supply chain updates, and earnings surprises. Favor signals that combine trend (50/200 SMA), momentum (MACD family and RSI), and volume confirmation (VWMA) to avoid false signals during earnings runs or sharp macro moves.

Notes on data access
- The current data retrieval step is temporarily failing due to a FileNotFoundError. I can retry automatically if you’d like, or proceed with the qualitative framework now and run the data-backed analysis as soon as the data service is available again.

Proposed next steps
- Option A: I retry data retrieval now and, once successful, generate the actual indicator readings and a detailed, data-backed trend report for NVDA.
- Option B: Proceed with the qualitative framework (as above) and prepare actionable guidance, then run the data-backed analysis when the data fetch works.

Below is a concise table summarizing the 8 indicators and their NVDA-specific roles.

| Indicator       | Role / Insight                                | NVDA-specific notes                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma    | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support | Aligns with earnings cycles; filters noise in choppy markets |
| close_200_sma   | Long-term trend confirmation                    | Helps avoid premature entries during sector rotations |
| close_10_ema    | Quick momentum shifts                           | Captures rapid moves around AI news and earnings   |
| macd            | Momentum and trend-change signal                | Crossovers + histograms corroborate price action    |
| macds           | MACD signal line smoothing                       | Reduces false positives in volatile periods          |
| macdh           | Momentum strength / divergence visualization     | Divergences can hint at impending reversals            |
| rsi             | Overbought/oversold momentum gauge                | Use with trend context to avoid false reversals       |
| vwma            | Volume-adjusted trend confirmation                 | Validates breakouts with actual trading participation  |

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now, say “Retry NVDA data,” and I’ll attempt another fetch and then produce a full, data-backed NVDA indicator report as soon as it succeeds.
