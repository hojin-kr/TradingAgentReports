Recommendation: Hold now.

Rationale
- The bull case for Nvidia remains intact—AI compute leadership, expanding software monetization, and healthy cash generation provide a durable growth thesis.
- The bear case introduces meaningful downside risks: stretched valuation, potential AI capex normalization, regulatory/geopolitical headwinds, and competitive/momentum risks. These risks are not negligible and are being partly priced into the current level.
- Given the balance of risks and the absence of a durable, clean accelerant in data-center/software metrics yet, a cautious stance is warranted.

Key actions and plan
- Position sizing and risk controls
  - Maintain existing exposure; avoid adding aggressively at current levels.
  - Implement hedges to cap downside if you remain long (collar or protective puts) to convert thesis into a risk-managed exposure.
- Entry/exit triggers (time and price)
  - Reassess within 1–2 quarters around earnings and major AI catalyst events.
  - If price pulls back 8–12% from recent highs with momentum improving on volume, consider a scaled-in starter or a modest option-based bet to participate with limited downside.
  - Move to Buy if: clear, durable acceleration in data-center revenue with rising software/services mix and confirmable monetization milestones that justify the multiple.
  - Move to Sell if: AI capex slows meaningfully (soft guidance, margin deterioration) or regulatory/geopolitical developments materially curb growth.
- Strategic actions
  - If already long: trim to reduce gamma risk while preserving exposure to the AI cycle.
  - If not long: avoid full-weight entry; consider a very small starter only on meaningful weakness with tight risk controls.
- Monitoring framework
  - Data-center revenue trajectory, gross/margin stability, software/services growth, backlog trends.
  - Regulatory/export control developments and geopolitical risk diversification.
  - Technicals: trend lines (50/200-day), momentum (MACD, RSI), and implied volatility around catalysts.
- Time horizon
  - Short term (1–3 months): cautious stance; hedges in place.
  - Medium term (6–12 months): reassess as AI adoption signals evolve; potential shift toward Buy if fundamentals strengthen and valuation remains reasonable.

Lessons integrated
- Avoid overreliance on a single data point or catalyst; corroborate with multiple data streams.
- Use risk controls (hedges, collars, options) to manage exposure in a high-valuation, high-volatility name.
- Update the view as new catalysts and data arrive; be prepared to pivot if evidence tilts toward accelerated growth or material deterioration.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
