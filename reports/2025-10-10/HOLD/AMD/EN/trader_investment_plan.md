Recommendation: Hold

Rationale
- The plan’s thesis is credible but hinges on a best-case path: diversified AI demand, durable margin uplift, and a capital structure that minimizes dilution. Current pricing already reflects a strong AI uplift, leaving less upside unless multiple hyperscalers commit and ROCm traction materializes.
- Key risks remain substantive: concentration risk with OpenAI as a marquee customer, potential dilution from the equity kicker, and Nvidia’s entrenched position. Without broader demand signals and visible margin improvement, risk-reward favors a cautious stance rather than new long exposure at current levels.

What would justify an upgrade to Buy
- Evidence of at least one additional credible hyperscaler committing to AMD AI accelerators within 4–8 quarters.
- Confirmed ROCm traction with multi-workload adoption and clear developer momentum across a broad customer base.
- Demonstrable, sustained gross margin expansion driven by a favorable AI mix and a capital plan that minimizes near-term dilution, improving ROIC.

Actionable plan (maintain Hold stance while you wait)
- Price/risk controls: establish a cautious trailing stop if you hold AMD; define entry-trigger grids if you’re considering later re-entry (e.g., only on pullbacks with better visibility).
- Watchlist milestones: monitor additional hyperscaler commitments, ROCm ecosystem progress, and quarterly margin signals by product line.
- Risk management: consider hedging or diversification to mitigate macro-earnings risk while awaiting catalysts; reassess if Nvidia dynamics or OpenAI terms shift materially.
- Catalysts to upgrade: confirm diversified AI demand beyond a single anchor, sustained margin uplift, and a cleaner capital-structure story.

Lessons to apply
- Avoid relying on a single anchor for upside; require broader demand signals.
- Demand credible margin and cash-flow support beyond headline AI announcements.
- Pay attention to dilution risk from equity-like incentives and ensure ROIC remains compelling.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
