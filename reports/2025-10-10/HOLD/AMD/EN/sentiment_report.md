I tried to fetch the latest AMD Reddit stock news for 2025-10-10, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like there’s an internal issue with the data fetch endpoint right now. I can retry shortly, but I don’t want to hold you up if you’d prefer to move ahead.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can attempt the data fetch again immediately.
- Proceed with a detailed qualitative framework: I can deliver a comprehensive long-form AMD social-media/news sentiment analysis framework, outline the post-by-post sentiment methodology, and provide a ready-to-fill Markdown table structure for you to populate once data access is restored.
- Alternative data sources: If you have access to other sources or datasets (e.g., a different feed for AMD news) I can incorporate those.

If you’d like me to proceed with the qualitative framework right away, here’s a plan I’ll follow (and you can tell me to go ahead):

What the long report will include (once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: High-level sentiment trend for AMD over the past week, with notable spikes and potential correlation to any public events.
- Social sentiment deep dive: Daily sentiment splits (positive/neutral/negative), top themes driving mood (e.g., AI/Server GPU demand, supply chain chatter, console/CPU/GPU product cycles, pricing, partnerships).
- Notable posts and threads: A curated set of representative posts that illustrate dominant narratives, risks, and catalysts.
- News + filings correlation: How the social sentiment aligns with recent AMD company news, earnings chatter, product launches, or strategic announcements.
- Thematic analysis: Break down themes into actionable trader insights (e.g., sentiment around AI datacenter demand vs. consumer GPU demand, competitive positioning against Nvidia/Intel, supply chain risk).
- Short-term implications for traders: Potential sentiment-driven catalysts, risk flags, and trading note (cautious vs. aggressive stance) with example scenarios.
- Data quality notes: Limitations of social-signal data, potential biases, and how I’ll weight sources.

Markdown table plan (to append at the end)
- I’ll include a summary table organizing key points. Example structure (the table will be populated with real data once the fetch works):
  - Date
  - Platform (Reddit, X, etc.)
  - Topic / Theme
  - Sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
  - Notable Posts (sample snippets or post IDs)
  - Connected News / Events
  - Trader Implications (e.g., short-term pressure up/down)
  - Data Source Notes

Example (placeholder format to show layout)
- Date: 2025-10-04 | Platform: Reddit | Topic: AI Datacenter Demand | Sentiment: Positive | Notable Posts: "AMD MI300X on track for data centers" | Connected News: Earnings hint of AI ramp | Trader Implications: Potential upside bias if AI capex remains strong
- Date: 2025-10-06 | Platform: Reddit | Topic: GPU Supply Concerns | Sentiment: Negative | Notable Posts: "Supply chain delay rumors" | Connected News: None | Trader Implications: Watch for risk-off pressure; possible pullback

Would you like me to:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
- Proceed immediately with the qualitative framework and a ready-to-fill Markdown table so I can deliver a complete report as soon as the data tool comes back online?

If you want me to retry now, I’ll attempt the AMD data fetch again and then compile the full long-report with the table appended as soon as I have the data.
