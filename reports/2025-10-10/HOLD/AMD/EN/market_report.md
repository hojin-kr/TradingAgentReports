I attempted to fetch AMD data and compute the requested indicators, but the data retrieval service returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a temporary issue with the data source. I can retry automatically, or you can tell me to try again later. In the meantime, here is a clear plan and the selected indicators I will use once the data is available, along with the rationale and how to interpret them for AMD.

Selected indicators (maximum 8, chosen for diversity and complementary insights)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- atr
- vwma

Rationale and how these indicators complement each other
- close_50_sma (50-period simple moving average): Tracks the medium-term trend and potential dynamic support/resistance. Useful for identifying trend direction (up above 50SMA, down below) and for filtering noisy moves when price is near the 50SMA.
- close_200_sma (200-period simple moving average): Provides a broader, long-term trend benchmark. Useful for identifying major regime (bullish above 200SMA, bearish below). Helps confirm trend alignment with the 50SMA (e.g., golden cross/death cross dynamics).
- macd (MACD line): Momentum gauge that highlights crossovers between the MACD line and zero/centerline, indicating potential trend changes. Useful for catching shifts in momentum that may precede price moves.
- macdh (MACD Histogram): Visualizes the gap between MACD and its signal, offering insight into momentum strength and potential divergences. Helps gauge acceleration or fading of moves.
- rsi (Relative Strength Index): Momentum oscillator that flags overbought/oversold conditions (commonly 70/30 thresholds) and potential divergences. Useful for spotting reversals or pullbacks within a prevailing trend.
- boll (Bollinger Middle / 20 SMA): Provides a dynamic baseline for price relative to recent volatility. Used in conjunction with bands to identify breakouts, pullbacks, and mean-reversion opportunities.
- atr (Average True Range): Measures market volatility, informs risk management, and helps adjust stop placement and position sizing according to current volatility regime.
- vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average): Combines price action with volume, helping confirm trends when price moves are supported by higher volume. Useful to filter out moves that lack participation.

How I will interpret these indicators together (once data is available)
- Trend confirmation: If price remains above both 50SMA and 200SMA, and MACD is positive with a rising histogram, the trend is likely bullish. If price stays below both SMAs with MACD negative and histogram negative, the trend is likely bearish.
- Momentum and timing: MACD crossovers and MACD histogram changes (macd, macdh) provide signals about momentum shifts and potential entry/exit timing, especially when aligned with RSI divergence or overbought/oversold readings.
- Volatility context: ATR will tell us whether recent moves are occurring in a high- or low-volatility environment, informing risk controls (e.g., tighter stops in low volatility may be inappropriate, or looser stops in high volatility may be warranted).
- Price-structure validation: Boll middle acts as a dynamic centerline; price testing of the upper/lower Boll bands with accompanying MACD/RSI behavior can help identify breakout vs mean-reversion setups.
- Volume validation: VWMA ensures that any move is supported by sufficient volume, reducing the risk of false signals from low-volume spikes.

Next steps
- I will retry retrieving AMD data and compute the eight indicators above for the requested window (and I can adjust the date range if you prefer). Once the data is available, I will deliver a detailed trend report with the exact indicator readings, interpretations, and potential trading implications.
- If you want an earlier start, I can attempt a narrower analysis with the data I can fetch now, but it may be incomplete without all eight indicators.

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry fetching the data right away, or wait a few minutes and retry automatically?
- Would you like me to adjust the date range (e.g., 2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31) or keep it as 2024-10-01 to 2025-10-10 as previously requested?

Markdown table: key indicators and their purpose (summary)
| Indicator | Category | Purpose / What it tells you | How to watch for AMD context |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA implies bullish bias; cross below could signal trend weakening |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark and major regime signal | Price above 200SMA suggests long-term uptrend; cross below signals potential major reversal or pullback |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum crossovers and trend changes | MACD line crossing above zero and increasing suggests bullish momentum; cross below indicates bearish momentum |
| macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength and divergence visualization | Increasing positive histogram supports uptrend; shrinking/negative histogram warns of weakening momentum or reversal |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals | RSI > 70 overbought, RSI < 30 oversold; watch for divergences with price |
| boll | Bollinger Middle | Baseline for price and mean-reversion context | Price near/bouncing from middle line indicates mean-reversion or continuation depending on other signals |
| atr | Volatility | Current market volatility for risk management | Rising ATR implies wider price swings; adjust stops/position sizes accordingly |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Price action confirmed by volume; trend with volume | Price moving with rising VWMA supports the validity of the trend; divergence with VWMA may warn of weakening moves |

Note: I’ll provide a full, detailed trend report with exact indicator readings and a practical interpretation once the data retrieval issue is resolved. If you’d like me to proceed with a retry now, I’ll run it and return the complete analysis as soon as the data is available.
