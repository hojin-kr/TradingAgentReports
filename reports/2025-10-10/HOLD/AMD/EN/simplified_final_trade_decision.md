# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD has potential AI-driven revenue from its OpenAI deal and ROCm platform, but heavy reliance on one big customer adds risk. Hold with patience until demand broadens, margins rise, and dilution is controlled.

## Investment Decision
Investment Decision: HOLD — Confidence: Moderate

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Positive catalysts:
  - OpenAI deal could provide ongoing AI-related demand beyond a single spike.
  - ROCm platform and tooling may boost margins if AI workloads scale.

- Key risks:
  - Concentration risk: heavy reliance on OpenAI; slower ramp or delays from others could reduce growth.
  - Dilution risk: equity kicker could hurt near-term earnings and returns if AI ramp is slow.
  - Competitive/tech risk: Nvidia’s strong position and ROCm traction uncertainty limit clear margin uplift.

- Neutral perspective:
  - Upgrading requires more credible diversification, steady gross-margin gains, and a capital plan that reduces near-term dilution.

## Risks To Watch
- Concentration risk: one large anchor customer drives much of the AI ramp.
- Dilution risk: equity kicker may weigh on earnings and ROIC if AI gains lag.
- Competition and ROCm traction risk: Nvidia dominance; uncertain broad adoption of ROCm.
- Margin risk: AI mix must meaningfully lift gross margins and enable operating leverage.
- Execution risk: need tangible catalysts (broader demand, proven ROCm traction, clearer capital plan).
