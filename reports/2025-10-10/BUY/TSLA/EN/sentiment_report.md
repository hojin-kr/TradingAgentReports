Sorry — I hit a tool error while trying to fetch TSLA Reddit data for 2025-10-10. The get_reddit_stock_info call returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t pull that Reddit data right now.

Options to move forward:
- Retry now: I can attempt the Reddit data fetch again immediately.
- Switch to fallback sources: I can proceed with a comprehensive sentiment and news analysis using non-Reddit sources (e.g., latest TSLA news headlines, official statements, and general social sentiment from other platforms if available).
- Proceed with a structured outline: I can present a detailed plan and a ready-to-fill report template, and then populate it once data access is restored.

If you’d like, here’s how I’ll proceed with the fallback plan (and what you’ll get in the final long report):
- Data sources (fallback): Latest TSLA company news (press releases, earnings, product updates), mainstream financial media, and general public sentiment from other social platforms (where available) over the past week.
- Key analysis areas:
  - Daily sentiment trend for the past 7 days and notable catalysts driving sentiment (new model announcements, price changes, production updates, regulatory news, supply chain developments).
  - Thematic breakdown: demand signals, profitability/margin concerns, Autopilot/AI updates, safety/regulatory scrutiny, competition, and valuation chatter.
  - News impact assessment: which headlines moved sentiment the most, and how that aligns with price action and volatility.
  - Trader implications: potential short-term catalysts, risk factors, and scenario-based outcomes (bull vs bear catalysts and their likely price impact).
  - Risk and uncertainty: coverage gaps, bias in social chatter, and potential overreactions around earnings or product cycles.
- Deliverables: A detailed narrative report with quantitative sentiment cues, event-driven insights, and practical trading takeaways, plus a final Markdown table organizing key points.

Markdown table skeleton (to appear at the end of the final report):
- This is a template you can expect to see filled in the full report.

| Topic / Theme | Key Takeaways | Data Source(s) | Sentiment Signal (Tone) | Implications for TSLA | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Daily sentiment trend | e.g., Mixed with spikes on X headlines | Reddit/Twitter/News (fallback) | Positive/Neutral/Negative | Potential short-term price move | High/Medium/Low |
| Catalysts this week | e.g., New model update, price action | Company press releases, headlines | Positive/Negative | Trading opportunity window | High/Medium/Low |
| Regulatory / safety | e.g., Regulators scrutinize Autopilot | Regulatory news | Negative/Neutral | Risk event; hedge considerations | High/Medium/Low |
| Competitive landscape | e.g., Rivals launching similar tech | Industry coverage | Neutral/Positive/Negative | Long-term positioning implications | Medium |
| Price action / volatility | e.g., Vol spikes after headlines | Price data + sentiment | Correlated/ Divergent | Entry/exit timing hints | High/Medium/Low |

Next step: Tell me how you’d like to proceed:
- Say “Retry” to attempt the Reddit data fetch again now.
- Say “Fallback” to proceed with the non-Reddit sentiment + news analysis following the plan above.
- Say “Outline” if you want me to just provide a more detailed report structure and wait for data.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull now, or switch to the fallback plan?
