Decision: BUY

Rationale (why this stance fits today)
- Multi-engine growth thesis remains intact: Tesla’s auto volume growth with favorable mix, energy storage and solar revenue potential, and software/services monetization create multiple cash-flow streams that can compound over time.
- Moat breadth supports resilience: brand, Supercharger network, software flywheel (OTA, fleet data), vertical integration, and ongoing battery/pack leadership provide a defensible backdrop even if one leg underperforms.
- Valuation is priced for upside but not reckless: while the stock is not cheap, a blended base of durable auto margins plus recurring energy/software cash flows offers a probabilistic upside if autonomous/robotaxi optionality materializes later, mitigated by meaningful downside protections via hedges and risk controls.
- Risks acknowledged but manageable with discipline: macro headwinds, regulatory evolution around autonomy, and competitive software/battery progress exist, but diversified growth legs and strong balance sheet support optionality.

Recommended execution plan (structured entry and risk controls)
1) Position sizing and pacing
- Start with a foundational tranche risked at 1-2% of portfolio, then scale in as price action confirms trend.
- Use a staged add-on approach: add on confirmed bullish signals (price clearing key levels, confirming momentum) and/or disciplined pullbacks that hold defined support.

2) Technical confirmations to scale in
- Target setup: price above major moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day) with positive momentum and non-extreme RSI readings.
- Use a rule-based stop: initial stops below a defined support level or an ATR-based floor to avoid being knocked out by normal volatility.

3) Hedging and risk controls
- Implement protective options hedges to preserve upside while limiting downside:
  - Protective puts: buy puts a few months out at ATM to slightly ITM, or use a put spread if you want to reduce cost.
  - Or a collar: long TSLA, long put, short slightly OTM call to finance puts and cap upside if budget is tight.
- Alternative: vertical bear spreads to cap downside risk while maintaining upside potential if you’re more risk-tolerant on near-term volatility.

4) Catalysts and cadence
- Key milestones: quarterly deliveries, regional gross margin improvements, energy-storage project wins, software/OTA monetization progress, and any regulatory updates on autonomy.
- Reassess if gross margins don’t stabilize with volume growth or if energy/storage cash flow remains volatile.

5) Position management and exit plan
- Predefine triggers to trim or exit if core profitability signals deteriorate (e.g., sustained margin compression beyond a set window).
- If multi-quarter data shows durable margin improvement and strong energy/software contribution, consider adding on meaningful pullbacks toward the mid-to-lower range of prior ranges.
- Time horizon: 6–12 months or longer if visibility on autonomy and software monetization improves and cash flows stabilize.

6) Data discipline and decision framework
- Use a confluence of trend, momentum, and valuation signals. If live data is limited, rely on narrative milestones (deliveries, energy backlog, FSD regulatory progress) and template-ready actions for rapid execution once data returns.

Lessons incorporated (learning from past decisions)
- Don’t hinge on a single catalyst. Demand multi-signal confirmation across hardware mix, energy/software contributions, and policy signals.
- Treat autonomy as optional upside, not a guaranteed near-term driver. Focus on durable auto margins and recurring cash flows as the core engine.
- Build a probabilistic, probability-weighted view. Assign realistic odds to key events (autonomy monetization, subsidies trajectory) and weight outcomes accordingly.
- Use hedges to protect tail risk in a high-valuation, high-volatility name.

If you want a tighter plan, I can tailor exact entry/exit levels to a budget, and propose precise option structures (strike choices, expiry windows) aligned with your time horizon and risk tolerance.
