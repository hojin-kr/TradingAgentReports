Sorry — it looks like the data tools are currently returning a FileNotFoundError. I can’t fetch TSLA’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financial statements right now due to that environment error.

Here are your options to move forward:
- Option A: I retry immediately to fetch TSLA data. If the tools come back online, I’ll pull the latest quarterly balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, plus insider sentiment and insider transactions, and then assemble a comprehensive fundamental report.
- Option B: You provide the data (or paste outputs from the tools you have), and I’ll craft the full report around it.
- Option C: I prepare a robust framework report using recent publicly known context (from memory up to 2024-06) with explicit placeholders where new data would go, so you can fill in the latest figures once the data tools are accessible.

If you’d like me to retry now, say “Retry” and I’ll attempt again. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the final report and the kind of insights I’ll extract once data is available. This will help traders judge fundamentals for TSLA.

What the final report will include (once data is retrieved)
- Company profile and business segments: Overview of Tesla, Inc. operations across automotive, energy storage, and services; key markets; competitive positioning.
- Financial documents overview (latest quarter/annual): 
  - Income statement: Revenues, gross profit, operating income, net income, margins, R&D and SG&A as percentages of revenue; year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes.
  - Balance sheet: Cash and equivalents, short-term/long-term debt, working capital, goodwill/intangibles (if any); liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio).
  - Cash flow: Operating cash flow, capex (property, plant, and equipment), free cash flow, financing cash flow.
- Financial history and trend analysis: 
  - Top-line growth trajectory, profitability progression, margin expansion/contraction.
  - Cash flow quality (FCF conversion) and capex intensity (R&D vs. Capex balance, capacity expansion plans).
  - Leverage and liquidity evolution (debt levels, maturities, interest coverage if available).
- Insider sentiment (past 15 days) and insider transactions:
  - Sentiment tone (bullish/bearish/neutral) from public disclosures.
  - Recent insider buys/sells, volume, and potential implications for management confidence vs. risk signals.
- Key risk and upside factors:
  - Regulatory, supply chain, competition, and macro considerations.
  - Milestones (production ramp-ups, new models/variants, energy/solar initiatives, AI/robotics integration).
- Data quality and caveats:
  - Any gaps, revisions, or methodology notes from the sources.

Appendix: Markdown table (at the end)
- I’ll include a concise table with the most impactful points for quick scanning, including figures and dates where available.

If you want me to proceed with a retry (Option A) now, I’ll attempt to fetch TSLA data again and then deliver the full, detailed report in the next message. If you prefer a different route (Options B or C), tell me which you prefer and I’ll adjust.
