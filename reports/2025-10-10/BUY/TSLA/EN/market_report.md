I tried to fetch TSLA data and run the indicator suite, but the data access layer returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t produce a live, data-driven trend report right now. If you’d like, I can either (a) retry once the data service is available, or (b) provide a detailed, hypothetical framework you can use now and then plug in real numbers once the data fetch works. Below is a carefully chosen set of indicators and a plan you can apply to TSLA, plus a table summarizing how to interpret them.

Selected indicators for TSLA (up to 8, chosen for complementary signals and no redundancy)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable for TSLA
- Multi-timeframe trend with moving averages: close_10_ema, close_50_sma, and close_200_sma give a layered view of momentum and trend strength across short, medium, and long horizons. This helps distinguish fleeting moves from persistent shifts, which is crucial for a high-volatility stock like TSLA.
- MACD family for momentum and potential trend changes: macd provides the core momentum signal, macds adds the signal line for crossovers, and macdh (MACD histogram) shows momentum strength and potential divergences. Together, they help filter entries and anticipate accelerations or decelerations in TSLA’s price action.
- RSI for overbought/oversold context and divergence: rsi flags potential reversals when momentum extremities align or diverge from price, a common feature in TSLA’s volatile swings.
- ATR for volatility-aware risk management: atr gauges current market volatility, enabling smarter position sizing and stop placement to adapt to TSLA’s often wide-ranging moves.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A concise trend verdict (Bullish/Neutral/Bearish) based on the alignment and crossovers of the 10 EMA, 50 SMA, and 200 SMA.
- Momentum context from MACD components (crossovers, histogram strength/divergence) to assess potential continuation or fading of moves.
- Momentum and overbought/oversold context from RSI to gauge possible reversals and divergences.
- Volatility-aware risk parameters derived from ATR to inform stop-loss and position sizing.
- Optional: a few trade ideas or risk management notes tailored to TSLA’s current regime, once the data is in.

Next steps
- Retry data retrieval to fetch TSLA and run the 8 indicators listed above.
- If you prefer, I can work from a provided CSV or a screenshot of indicator outputs and generate the full narrative report and the Markdown table right away.

Markdown table: key points and interpretation (to accompany the report)
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  Category: Moving Averages
  Purpose / Signals: Short-term momentum; quick shifts in trend
  How to interpret: Price crossing above the 10 EMA on rising volume is bullish; crossing below is bearish. Use with longer MA filters to reduce noise.

- Indicator: close_50_sma
  Category: Moving Averages
  Purpose / Signals: Medium-term trend direction; dynamic support/resistance
  How to interpret: Price above 50 SMA suggests an uptrend; below suggests downtrend. Crossovers with 10 EMA can signal momentum shifts.

- Indicator: close_200_sma
  Category: Moving Averages
  Purpose / Signals: Long-term trend baseline
  How to interpret: Price above 200 SMA indicates long-term bullish context; below indicates bearish. Golden/death cross with 50 SMA adds additional confirmation.

- Indicator: macd
  Category: MACD Related
  Purpose / Signals: Core momentum changes
  How to interpret: MACD line crossing above signal is bullish momentum; crossing below is bearish. Confirm with histogram and RSI.

- Indicator: macds
  Category: MACD Related
  Purpose / Signals: Smoothing-based confirmation of MACD signals
  How to interpret: MACD Signal crossovers with MACD line strengthen entry/exit signals; use with histogram and price action.

- Indicator: macdh
  Category: MACD Related
  Purpose / Signals: Momentum strength and divergence
  How to interpret: Histogram rising in positive territory = strengthening bullish momentum; shrinking or turning negative = momentum waning or reversal risk.

- Indicator: rsi
  Category: Momentum
  Purpose / Signals: Overbought/oversold context; momentum extremes
  How to interpret: RSI > 70 suggests overbought risk (watch for reversals); RSI < 30 suggests oversold risk (watch for rebounds). Look for divergences with price.

- Indicator: atr
  Category: Volatility
  Purpose / Signals: Market volatility level; risk management
  How to interpret: Higher ATR implies wider price swings and larger potential stops; adjust position size and stops accordingly. A rising ATR amid price moves can signal stronger trend momentum but higher risk.

Notes and caveats
- Data availability: The 8 indicators above should be run on TSLA using the latest daily data. In volatile meme-style or high-variance spaces, MACD and RSI signals can diverge from price action; rely on the confluence of signals rather than any single indicator.
- Redundancy caution: While MACD components are related, they each offer a slightly different lens (momentum signal, smoothing, and histogram momentum). They’re kept together here to give a fuller MACD-based read without duplicating price action signaling from a single metric.
- Context matters: Use the set in combination with chart patterns, volume analysis (e.g., VWMA if you want to add another dimension later), and fundamental catalysts when evaluating TSLA.

If you’d like me to proceed, please confirm you want me to retry fetching TSLA data now, or provide an alternate data source (CSV) you want me to analyze.
