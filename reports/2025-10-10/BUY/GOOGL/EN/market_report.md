Data retrieval note:
- I attempted to fetch GOOGL price data and compute the requested indicators, but the calls returned a FileNotFoundError from the data sources. This means I don’t have the actual recent values to produce a data-driven trend report right now.
- I can retry fetching the data (either in parallel or sequentially) or run a narrower set of indicators if you’d like. Please tell me whether to retry now or adjust the scope.

Selected indicators (up to 8) for complementary insights
Rationale: These provide a balanced view across trend direction, momentum, and volume/volatility context without overlap.

1) close_50_sma
- Role: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
- Why it helps: Helps identify the prevailing trend and potential pullbacks near the 50-day baseline.
- Trade cues: Price sustained above 50 SMA with rising slope suggests bullish bias; cross below and/or a break of the 50 SMA can warn of a weakening trend.

2) close_200_sma
- Role: Long-term trend benchmark
- Why it helps: Confirms the broader market regime (golden/death cross possibilities) and steadies longer-term bias.
- Trade cues: Price above 200 SMA with rising momentum supports bullish stance; price below it or a bearish cross signals structural risk.

3) close_10_ema
- Role: Short-term momentum cue
- Why it helps: Captures quick shifts in momentum and potential entries in choppy markets.
- Trade cues: Price crossing above/below the 10 EMA with corroboration from other indicators can generate timely signals, but be mindful of noise in rangy markets.

4) macd
- Role: Core momentum indicator
- Why it helps: Signals trend changes via the MACD line/EMAs cross and divergence.
- Trade cues: MACD line crossing above the signal line and histogram turning positive support bullish moves; crossing below/sustained negative momentum supports bearish moves.

5) macds
- Role: MACD signal line
- Why it helps: Provides a smoothed trigger to accompany MACD cross signals.
- Trade cues: MACD crossing the MACD signal line in the same direction as the MACD trend strengthens the signal; misalignment warrants caution.

6) macdh
- Role: MACD histogram
- Why it helps: Visualizes momentum strength and early divergence cues.
- Trade cues: Expanding positive histogram with price up generally confirms bullish momentum; shrinking or negative histogram hints at fatigue or reversal risk.

7) rsi
- Role: Momentum and overbought/oversold gauge
- Why it helps: Flags potential reversals and divergence against price trends.
- Trade cues: RSI approaching overbought (≈70) or oversold (≈30) levels can signal pullbacks or reversals, especially when aligned with trend direction from price/MA indicators.

8) vwma
- Role: Volume-weighted moving average
- Why it helps: Integrates price action with volume to validate trend strength; filters out price moves with weak volume, and highlights conviction moves.
- Trade cues: Price trading above VWMA with rising volume supports a genuine uptrend; price below VWMA with declining volume raises caution on the move’s sustainability.

How to interpret these indicators together (general framework for 2025-10-10 context)
- Alignment across time horizons: A bullish setup is strongest when price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA, the 10 EMA is trending higher, MACD line is above its signal with a positive histogram, RSI is not in extreme overbought territory for the current trend, and price sits above VWMA with rising volume. Conversely, a bearish setup is strongest when price is below these averages, MACD is negative with a negative histogram, RSI shows momentum to the downside without overextension, and price trades below VWMA with weakening volume.
- Confluence signals: Look for multiple indicators signaling in the same direction before acting. For example, price above 50SMA, 200SMA uptrend, MACD positive and rising, RSI not overbought, and VWMA confirming volume-supported up-move.
- Risk guards: Use ATR for volatility context and to set position sizing/slippage awareness (not in the selected 8 here due to cap, but advisable to incorporate in actual trades). Since we’re focusing on 8 indicators, I’ll add guidance to layer ATR-based risk rules when data is available.

Next steps to proceed
- I can retry fetching the data now (in parallel or sequentially) and then generate a concrete, data-driven trend report with the 8 indicators above.
- If you prefer, I can run a smaller subset (e.g., 50_SMA, 200_SMA, MACD, RSI, VWMA) for a quicker turnaround and then layer the remaining indicators once data is retrieved.

Proposed action: Please confirm if I should retry data retrieval now. If yes, I’ll run the data fetch and provide a detailed, fully data-backed trend report with the 8 indicators and a final decision framework.

Key points at a glance (for quick reference)
- Indicators chosen: 50 SMA, 200 SMA, 10 EMA, MACD, MACD Signal (macds), MACD Histogram (macdh), RSI, VWMA
- Strengths: Combines trend (MAs), momentum (MACD trio, RSI), and volume/conviction (VWMA)
- Caveats: Real-time signals depend on fresh data; results can change rapidly in volatile periods. Use risk management (e.g., ATR for volatility-based stops) in live trading.

Markdown table: quick reference of indicators, purpose, and signals
- Indicator: close_50_sma | Purpose: Medium-term trend and dynamic support/resistance | Signals: price above with rising slope = bullish bias; drop below = caution
- Indicator: close_200_sma | Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark | Signals: price above with upward slope = positive regime; below = risk signal
- Indicator: close_10_ema | Purpose: Short-term momentum | Signals: cross above/below the 10 EMA as entry/exit hints; beware noise
- Indicator: macd | Purpose: Momentum/trend change | Signals: MACD line above signal with positive histogram = bullish; reverse for bearish
- Indicator: macds | Purpose: MACD signal line | Signals: Crosses in same direction as MACD trend strengthen signals
- Indicator: macdh | Purpose: MACD histogram | Signals: Expanding positive histogram supports uptrend; contracting/negative hints fatigue
- Indicator: rsi | Purpose: Momentum/overbought-oversold | Signals: Near 70/30 with potential divergences to warn on reversals
- Indicator: vwma | Purpose: Volume-filtered trend | Signals: Price above VWMA with rising volume = confirmed move; below/weak volume = caution
