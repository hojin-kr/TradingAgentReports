I’m running into an internal error fetching Reddit data for GOOGL on 2025-10-10 (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can’t retrieve the Reddit-based sentiment data right now.

What I can do next:
- I can retry fetching Reddit data for GOOGL on 2025-10-10 immediately and report back.
- If the retry fails again, I’ll proceed with a robust framework for the long-form report using whatever data I can gather from other sources or general sentiment signals, and clearly label any data gaps.

What I will deliver once the data fetch succeeds (or with a transparent gap if it doesn’t):
- Comprehensive long report on GOOGL (Alphabet) covering social media sentiment (Reddit), recent company news, and public sentiment over the past week.
- Fine-grained analysis with daily sentiment breakdown, key themes, notable catalysts, and implications for traders.
- Risk factors and potential trading implications, including sentiment-to-price interpretation, if supported by the data.
- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points (summary, drivers, risks, and suggested actions).

Questions to tailor the report:
- Do you want me to include only Reddit sentiment, or should I also factor in other social platforms if you provide sources?
- Do you want daily sentiment granularity (date-by-date) or a rolling 7-day window summary?
- Any specific metrics you’d like highlighted (e.g., top topics, sentiment polarity, post volume, notable posts)?

If you’d like me to retry fetching Reddit data now, say “Retry.” If you prefer, I can proceed with outlining and preparing the structure of the report now and fill in data once the tool is available.
