Recommendation: Buy Alphabet (GOOGL). The plan’s bull thesis—Gemini Enterprise monetization, cross-sell into Workspace/YouTube/Cloud, and AI infra expansion driving higher margins—offers a durable, multi-year growth path. Bear risks exist (regulatory, ad-headwinds, margin pressure), but they are not existential if Gemini adoption and cloud utilization ramp as expected. A disciplined, staged entry with clear triggers mitigates downside.

Actionable plan (concise)
- Initial entry: Allocate 2–4% of the portfolio to GOOGL now, sizing by risk tolerance.
  - Stop: hard stop 8–12% below entry or below the 200-day SMA on a break with momentum.
- Add-on rules (on momentum confirmation):
  - Add a second tranche if price trades above 50-day SMA and VWMA, MACD positive, RSI rising above 50, and volume above VWMA for multiple sessions.
  - Further add-on up to 8–10% total exposure if price action remains constructive and trend lines hold.
- Exit / take-profit plan:
  - Take partial profits around 20–30% gain on the initial tranche.
  - Use a trailing stop (15–20%, depending on volatility/ATR) on the remaining position.
  - Reassess quickly if Gemini adoption underperforms, cloud margins deteriorate, or regulatory actions escalate.
- Risk management & hedging:
  - Maintain diversification to avoid tech concentration risk.
  - Consider protective puts for explicit downside protection if you want insurance against near-term regime shifts.
- Monitoring cadence:
  - Weekly: momentum and news flow on Gemini, Cloud AI margins, capex progress, and regulatory signals.
  - Monthly: update the eight indicators and reassess entry/exit triggers.
- Time horizon: 12–24 months to allow Gemini monetization and cloud-margin improvements to materialize.

Lessons applied
- Use multi-signal confirmation instead of chasing hype.
- Rely on explicit triggers and staged entries to manage risk.
- Maintain clear exit/invalidation points to protect capital.

Final assessment
- The plan supports a constructive, long-bias view on GOOGL with disciplined risk controls and scalable upside through Gemini and cloud monetization.
