I attempted to fetch NFLX data (2024-10-10 to 2025-10-10) with get_YFin_data, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This appears to be an environment/data file access issue on the tool side, not a problem with the ticker or your request.

What I can do right now
- Retry data retrieval immediately if you’d like.
- If you prefer not to wait, I can still prepare a rigorous indicators-based framework using NFLX as the case, and you can run the data and indicators once the fetch works. I’ll provide a detailed plan and interpretation framework you can apply once data is available.

Recommended indicators set (up to 8, complementary, non-redundant)
I’m selecting indicators that give a well-rounded view of trend, momentum, volatility, and confirmatory signals for NFLX. These are the exact names you provided:

1) close_50_sma
- Why: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps identify whether NFLX is in a sustained uptrend or downtrend and can filter entries in noisy moves when combined with faster signals.

2) close_200_sma
- Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming the broader market context (golden cross/death cross risk, strategic bias) and avoiding premature entries in a trend that’s merely a pullback.

3) macd
- Why: Core momentum measure. Crossover signals and divergences can signal trend changes, especially when price is testing key supports/resistances identified by the moving averages.

4) macds
- Why: The signal line for MACD. MACD vs MACD Signal crossovers provide a cleaner trigger than MACD alone, helping reduce false signals in consolidating periods.

5) macdh
- Why: Momentum strength visualization. The histogram highlights the gap between MACD and its signal, aiding early divergence detection and momentum assessment in fast moves.

6) rsi
- Why: Momentum gauge and overbought/oversold context (with standard 70/30 thresholds). Useful for spotting potential reversals when price is overextended, especially after strong moves.

7) boll
- Why: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) gives a dynamic baseline for price behavior. Combined with the bands, it helps spot breakouts, mean-reversion opportunities, and volatility regimes.

8) atr
- Why: Volatility-based risk management. Helps set risk controls and position sizing, and complements breakout or continuation signals by indicating current market "room" for price movement.

Notes on the combination
- These 8 provide a balanced mix: trend direction (50/200 SMA), momentum (MACD family), price sustainability (RSI for overbought/oversold context), volatility and breakout framing (boll and atr).
- I avoided duplicating RSI with a stochastic oscillator (not currently in your list) to keep the set within the given options and minimize redundancy.

What I’ll deliver once data is fetched
- A detailed, nuanced narrative describing:
  - The current trend context from the 50/200 SMA relationship.
  - Momentum strength and potential divergences via MACD family signals.
  - RSI positioning with respect to trend strength and possible reversals.
  - Bollinger-based assessments of price squeezes, breakouts, or mean-reversion dynamics.
  - Volatility risk management via ATR-based stop considerations.
- Contextual interpretation tailored to NFLX (e.g., potential impact of earnings, subscriber growth signals, competitive landscape), while clearly separating data-driven indicator signals from fundamental considerations.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key observations, signals, and potential actions.

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry the data fetch now? If you approve, I’ll run get_YFin_data for NFLX again and then generate the full 8-indicator report with a thorough, trader-focused narrative and a final table of key takeaways.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with the qualitative framework right away (no numeric values yet) and you can plug in the data yourself once the fetch works.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed:
1) Retry data retrieval now, or
2) Use the qualitative framework and indicators plan in the meantime.
