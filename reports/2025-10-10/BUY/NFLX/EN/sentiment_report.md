Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit-based stock/news signals for NFLX, but I ran into a tool error:

- Error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory) when calling get_reddit_stock_info for NFLX on 2025-10-10.

What this means
- The data pull from the Reddit stock-info tool isn’t currently working on my end. It’s a backend/tool issue, not a market signal issue.
- I can retry immediately, or proceed with a qualitative framework and public-news sentiment analysis to keep momentum while the tool is fixed.

How you’d like to proceed
- Option A: Retry now to pull Reddit sentiment and latest posts/news for NFLX, then generate the full, data-backed long report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: Proceed right away with a high-quality, qualitative analysis based on general sentiment drivers and publicly available company news (these will be less data-driven without the Reddit dataset but can still be highly informative for traders).
- Option C: If you have another data source you want me to include (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment feeds, StockTwits, or a preferred news aggregator), share it and I’ll incorporate it.

What I’ll deliver (with Option chosen)
- A comprehensive long-form report detailing:
  - Social media sentiment: themes driving sentiment (e.g., content slate, pricing/policy changes, international growth, competitive dynamics, platform-specific features like ads or tiers) and how that sentiment has trended over the past week.
  - Public news signal synthesis: relevant NFLX news items from the past week (earnings-related updates, subscriber metrics, product/newsflow, partnerships, regulatory/policy moves, macro context).
  - Sentiment-to-price implications: how sentiment signals align or diverge from price action, volatility, and volume.
  - Key catalysts and risks for traders: upcoming events (earnings cadence, content releases, new pricing changes, regulatory or competitive threats).
  - Fine-grained takeaways for different trading horizons (intraday, swing, longer-term holders).
  - A compact, easy-to-scan decision framework for traders.
- A final Markdown table at the end that distills the most actionable points (drivers, sentiment tone, catalysts, risk, and implications).

If you’d like me to proceed with Option A (retry now) or Option B (qualitative now), please tell me which you prefer. If you have a preferred data source besides Reddit, mention it and I’ll incorporate it into the report.

Note: I’ll prefix any final deliverable that includes a Buy/Hold/Sell stance with FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY/HOLD/SELL, per your instruction. I don’t have a stance yet since we’re awaiting data, but I’ll publish a clear recommendation once the data comes through.
