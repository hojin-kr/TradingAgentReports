Recommendation: BUY META (META)

Rationale (why this aligns with the plan):
- AI-enabled monetization at scale: AI-driven targeting, measurement, and ad efficiency can lift ROAS/ARPU as scale grows, supporting durable growth.
- International monetization and ecosystem flywheel: Reels localization, shopping, and cross-border monetization reinforce long-run growth and data-network effects.
- Strong free cash flow and capital allocation: Robust cash generation underpins buybacks and optionality, providing downside protection and potential multiple expansion.
- Valuation upside if regulatory clarity improves: Near-term hurdles may ease with settlements and guardrails, potentially reducing discount rates.

Risks to monitor:
- Ad-market cyclicality and macro sensitivity.
- Ongoing regulatory/operational costs and privacy shifts.
- Uncertain near-term ROI on AI compute and Metaverse spend.
- Insider action is noise; monitor in context with fundamentals and catalysts.

Actionable, risk-managed entry plan:
- Positioning: Initiate a core long position now with staged buildup.
- Tiered-entry trigger: Add 20-30% of the intended full position on a move above a defined trend confirmation (e.g., price above 50-day and 200-day SMAs, positive MACD histogram, RSI ascending but not overbought); complete to full target weight as confirmations strengthen.
- Risk controls: Use an ATR-based initial stop (around 1.5x recent ATR). Consider hedging for earnings/regulatory headlines via a collar or protective puts on a portion of the position.
- Follow-up signals: Increase exposure if core trend remains intact with accelerating AI monetization signals, international monetization milestones, and healthy buyback cadence; pare back on weak catalysts or deteriorating ad-revenue prints.
- Catalysts to watch: regulatory developments, earnings prints showing ARPU lift and margin trajectory, AI compute milestones, international monetization progress, and buyback activity.

Final note:
- Iâ€™ll refresh the data-backed read when new price/indicator data is available and adjust entry/exit levels accordingly.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
