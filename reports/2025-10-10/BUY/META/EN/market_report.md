Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the data for META but hit a tool error:

- Issue: get_YFin_data returned FileNotFoundError (2, 'No such file or directory').
- Likely cause: The data source integration or path for Yahoo Finance data is temporarily unavailable or misconfigured in this environment.

What I can do now
- I can still provide a carefully chosen set of up to 8 indicators that are complementary and well-suited for META given its typical tech/large-cap volatility and event-driven moves. When the data fetch issue is resolved, I can run these indicators on META and deliver a detailed, data-backed interpretation.

Selected indicators (8) and why they’re suitable for META
- Moving Averages
  - close_50_sma: Identifies the intermediate trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. META often exhibits medium-term trend shifts around earnings and ad-market news; the 50-day line helps filter noise from longer-term moves.
  - close_200_sma: Provides the long-term trend benchmark. Useful for confirming overarching market regime (bullish vs. bearish) and spotting major trend changes (golden/death cross considerations) relevant for position sizing and risk posture.
  - close_10_ema: A responsive short-term momentum guide. Captures swift shifts in sentiment around product/news releases and earnings, helping with timely entries/exits when used with longer-term filters.

- MACD Related
  - macd: Core momentum signal via MACD line crossovers. Helps identify shifts in the rate of price change, which is valuable during volatile periods typical for META around headlines or earnings.
  - macds: MACD Signal line. Crossovers with MACD + histogram context provide more robust triggers than MACD alone, aiding in reducing false signals in choppy markets.
  - macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength and divergence. Useful to identify weakening or strengthening momentum ahead of price moves, especially near resistance/support levels.

- Momentum Indicator
  - rsi: Measures relative strength and momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. META can stay overbought/oversold longer in strong trends, so use RSI in conjunction with trend filters (the moving averages) to avoid mistimed entries.

- Volatility Indicator
  - atr: A practical view of market volatility for risk management and position sizing. Helps set dynamic stops and adapt to changing volatility regimes around earnings or major product launches.

How to use these indicators together (high-level framework)
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to gauge the dominant trend. Favor trades in the direction of the longer-term trend (e.g., price above 200SMA for long positions; below for shorts).
- Entry timing: When the price is aligned with the trend (price above 50SMA and above 200SMA for uptrends), look for a MACD bullish signal (macd crossing above macds with an increasing macdh). If the MACD histogram confirms momentum pickup (positive macdh), consider a confirmation for entry.
- Momentum validation: Cross-check RSI with trend signals. For long setups, RSI approaching or crossing above 50–60 plus MACD bullish timing strengthens conviction; for short setups, RSI moving lower from overbought levels (60–70 or higher) with a MACD bearish signal adds confidence.
- Volatility-aware risk management: Use ATR to scale stop losses and position sizing. In higher ATR regimes (more volatile periods), widen stops cautiously to avoid premature exits; in low volatility regimes, tighten stops to protect gains.
- Guardrails against false signals: In choppy markets, rely more on the MACD histogram signal (macdh) and the divergence cues plus ATR-based risk controls. Avoid overtrading when price action is oscillating around the moving averages without clear MACD momentum.

Limitations and caveats
- No single indicator is sufficient. Meta’s price can be driven by non-technical factors (earnings, ad market dynamics, regulatory headlines). Use these indicators as a blended framework, not as a sole decision-maker.
- In strong trending moves, momentum indicators like RSI can stay overbought/oversold for extended periods. Always place weight on trend direction from the moving averages to avoid counter-trend trades.
- Data quality matters. Once the data fetch is restored, I’ll run these indicators on the latest META data to provide concrete signals and confirm or adjust the qualitative framework above.

Proposed next steps
- Retry data fetch when the data service is available (start date can be 2024-10-10 to 2025-10-10 as planned). I’ll execute the indicators and deliver a data-backed trend report, including entry/exit signals and risk notes.
- If you’d like, I can also substitute or add a volatility-band indicator (boll or boll_ub/boll_lb) or a volume-based indicator (vwma) later, but for now I’ve kept to 8 indicators without redundancy and focused on a robust cross-check mix.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
- Indicator category
- Indicator name
- What it measures
- How it helps for META
- Typical signals to watch

- Moving Averages | close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Confirms trend direction; helps avoid counter-trend entries | Watch for price above/below 50SMA as trend filter
- Moving Averages | close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Confirms overall regime and major trend shifts | Look for price above 200SMA for long bias; crossovers with 50SMA as strength cue
- Moving Averages | close_10_ema | Short-term momentum shifts | Provides timely entry signals within the broader trend | Use with 50SMA/200SMA to filter false signals
- MACD | macd | Momentum signal via MACD line | Signals trend change and momentum shifts | Bullish when MACD crosses above MACD_S vs MACD_H; bearish when opposite
- MACD | macds | MACD signal line | Crossovers with MACD provide more robust triggers | Use crossovers with MACD for trade triggers
- MACD | macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength and divergence cues | Positive expansion suggests stronger up-move; negative expansion suggests weakness
- Momentum | rsi | Relative strength momentum | Overbought/oversold context; helps timing reversals | Watch for crossings around 50–60 in uptrends; divergences add weight
- Volatility | atr | True range-based volatility | Risk management and dynamic stop placement | Higher ATR -> wider stops; lower ATR -> tighter stops

If you want me to proceed with the data-driven run once the data path issue is resolved, tell me and I’ll fetch META again for 2024-10-10 to 2025-10-10 and generate the full indicator outputs and a precise, actionable read.
