I ran into an internal data retrieval error trying to fetch Yahoo Finance data for AAPL. The service returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the actual price history to compute the indicators right now. I can still lay out the plan and the eight indicators I’d use, and I’ll explain how I’d interpret them and combine them once the data is available. If you’d like, I can retry shortly or switch to a different data source.

Selected indicators (8) for a balanced view on AAPL
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these indicators are suitable now
- Trend context (close_50_sma, close_200_sma): These two establish the larger trend (mid-term and long-term). In many cases for AAPL, the relationship between the 50 SMA and 200 SMA helps identify bullish or bearish regimes (golden/death cross potential) and provides dynamic resistance/support zones.
- Short-term momentum (close_10_ema, macd family): The 10 EMA captures quicker shifts in price, while MACD, MACD Signal (macds), and MACD Histogram (macdh) reveal momentum strength and potential crossovers/divergences, which can precede or confirm trend changes.
- Current momentum strength (rsi): RSI helps gauge whether the stock is overbought or oversold and can highlight divergences with price, which is helpful for spotting potential reversals within the current trend.
- Volatility framework (atr): ATR informs how volatile the current move is and helps scale stops and position sizes in risk management, especially important for a high-mobility name like AAPL.

How I would use these indicators together (entry/exit framework, once data is available)
- Trend confirmation (long) setup:
  - Price above both 50 SMA and 200 SMA (bullish trend alignment).
  - 50 SMA above 200 SMA (positive trend slope). 
- Momentum alignment:
  - MACD line crossing above MACD Signal (macd > macds with a recent positive cross) and MACD Histogram turning positive (macdh > 0) supports a bullish momentum tilt.
  - 10 EMA trending above the price or above a short-term baseline (consistent with a rising price regime) adds confirmation of momentum.
- Momentum strength and risk signals:
  - RSI in a non-overbought zone (e.g., 40–70) supportive of sustainable upside momentum; avoid entries when RSI is in overbought territory (≥70) unless price action strongly confirms continuation.
- Volatility and risk management:
  - Use ATR to set a dynamic stop loss distance (e.g., 1.5–2x ATR). Higher ATR implies wider stops; lower ATR allows tighter risk controls.
- Entry decision:
  - When price is above 50 SMA and 200 SMA; MACD confirms with a recent bullish cross; RSI is not overbought; and ATR suggests manageable risk, consider a long entry with a stop just below a nearby dynamic support (e.g., below the 50 SMA or a recent swing low).
- Exit decision:
  - If MACD turns bearish (MACD crosses below MACD Signal or macdh turns negative), or RSI fails to sustain above 50, or price closes below both major SMAs, consider taking partial or full profit.
  - If price breaks the ATR-based stop or a major support level (e.g., a test of 50 SMA from above), reassess risk exposure.
- Short-side considerations (if the opposite setup occurs):
  - Price below 50 SMA and 200 SMA; MACD shows bearish cross; RSI trending downward toward oversold levels (but not yet extreme); ATR indicates elevated volatility suggesting tighter or protective risk controls.
  - Use a similar framework with inverted signal checks and appropriate stop placement above recent resistance or swing highs.

What I would do next (options)
- Retry data retrieval now or after a short interval to generate the exact indicator values and a live readout.
- If you want to proceed immediately without waiting for the data, I can provide an actionable checklist and a hypothetical scenario walkthrough, but it won’t reflect current AAPL data.
- If you’d prefer, I can switch to a different data feed (if you provide one) and run the same eight indicators.

Appendix: quick reference table of the indicators and their roles
| Indicator | Role / What it measures | How to use for entries/exits |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend baseline; dynamic support/resistance | Look for price above 50SMA as trend confirmation; use as a level for stop/targets. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA signals long-term bullish context; below signals bearish context. |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum indicator | Detect quick shifts in momentum; use with longer SMAs to filter signals. |
| macd | Momentum via EMA differences | Bullish cross (MACD above MACD Signal) supports long entries; bearish cross supports shorts. |
| macds | MACD signal line | Crosses with MACD to confirm momentum shifts; helps filter false signals. |
| macdh | MACD histogram | Momentum strength gauge; rising histogram supports trend acceleration; declining suggests weakening momentum. |
| rsi | Momentum strength / overbought-oversold | Watch for overbought/oversold extremes and divergences; use with trend context. |
| atr | Volatility measure | Scale stops/position sizes with current volatility; higher ATR means wider stops. |

If you’d like, I can attempt the data pull again now and then generate a concrete, date-stamped analysis for AAPL using these eight indicators. Please tell me whether to retry immediately or use an alternative data source you prefer.
