Sorry about that—the Reddit data fetch for AAPL failed with a FileNotFoundError. That looks like a backend/tool-side issue (not something you did). I can try again, or switch strategy if you’d like.

Options:
- Retry now: I can immediately attempt to pull Reddit sentiment data for AAPL for the past week (and the current date) again.
- Expand scope: If the Reddit tool remains flaky, I can attempt to gather sentiment from other sources or widen the date range once the tool is available.
- Prepare in parallel: I can draft the full long-report structure right now and include a ready-to-fill MakrMarkdown table at the end, so when the data comes back I can drop in the actual figures quickly.

What would you prefer?
- Go ahead and retry the Reddit data fetch now?
- Or proceed with the report framework and placeholders, so I can fill in once the data tool is back?

Note: The final report will include a MakrMarkdown table organizing key points (sentiment trends, notable catalysts, and implications for traders) as requested.
