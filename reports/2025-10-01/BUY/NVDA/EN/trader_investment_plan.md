Decision: Buy.

Rationale aligned with the provided plan
- Core thesis remains intact: Nvidia (NVDA) is a premier proxy for AI infrastructure spend, with a durable hardware/software moat (CUDA ecosystem, tooling, licensing) and strong cash generation that supports ongoing R&D and capital returns.
- Near-term concerns acknowledged but manageable: valuation risk, regulatory/regional exposure (China/export controls), potential demand normalization, and macro shocks are real but do not decisively negate the long-term AI capex cycle. A disciplined, hedged, staged approach can capture upside while limiting downside.

Key risks to monitor
- Valuation sensitivity: a material AI demand slowdown or macro shock could compress multiples quickly.
- Regulatory/regional dynamics: export controls, China exposure, and antitrust scrutiny could alter profitability or growth vectors.
- Competitive and product-cycle risks: AMD, TPU/Google initiatives, and China accelerators could erode share or alter economics if they materially close the gap.

Practical execution plan (actionable steps)
- Position sizing: Begin with a disciplined overweight exposure in the range of 2–4% of the equity sleeve, with a plan to scale to 6–8% if the setup confirms (breakouts, sustained momentum, favorable macro data).
- Risk controls: Implement a hedged core (collar or protective puts) to cap downside while preserving upside. Finance the collar by selling a higher-strike call or using a long-dated put with a modest premium offset.
- Entry protocol: Favor a staged entry. Accumulate on dips or as NVDA breaks above meaningful resistance with positive momentum indicators (e.g., MACD positive, RSI trending up but not oversold/overbought).
- Scaling and exposure management: Add in increments on confirmed data-center demand signals or favorable earnings cadence; trim or trim hedges if momentum falters or if price action fails to sustain breakout with volume.
- Exit discipline: Establish a price-target ladder (e.g., partial trim at +15–20% from initial entry; reassess beyond that) and a hard risk guardrail if macro/regulatory shocks or a meaningful shift in AI demand occurs.
- Catalyst and risk tracking: Monitor data-center revenue growth, software monetization progress, gross margin trajectory, and regulatory headlines (China exposure, export controls) as primary catalysts for re-rating or risk reassessment.
- Portfolio hygiene: Maintain diversification across AI-enabled themes to avoid concentration risk; reassess risk-reward balance as new data arrives.

Learning from past decisions
- Don’t chase valuation without credible growth pathways; focus on durable drivers like AI infra demand and software monetization.
- Use hedges and catalysts to manage downside risk rather than relying on conviction alone.
- Maintain discipline with stop criteria, position sizing, and exit plans to adapt to regime shifts.

Bottom line
- Buy, but with a structured, hedged, staged approach that limits downside while preserving upside on NVDA’s long-duration AI infrastructure thesis.
