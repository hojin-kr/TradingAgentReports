Sorry about that—the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data source or path isn’t accessible right now.

I can proceed in one of three ways. Please tell me which you prefer:
1) Retry the Reddit data fetch now (I’ll attempt again immediately).
2) Proceed with a best-effort, data-light META sentiment and news report using other sources and general context (no Reddit data until the tool works again). I’ll clearly label any gaps or placeholders.
3) Attempt to use the tool again later automatically and notify you when it succeeds, then generate the full report with Reddit data included.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with option 2 (the data-light version), I’ll deliver a comprehensive META analysis structured for traders, including:
- Social sentiment themes and potential drivers (AI monetization, ad market, regulatory risk, platform integrity, competition).
- Summary of recent company news signals (without speculative specifics).
- Implications and scenarios for traders (bullish/bearish catalysts, risk factors, watchlist items).
- A Markdown-friendly key-points table at the end.

Which path would you prefer?
