Decision: Buy (with staged, data-confirmed entry and robust risk controls)

Rationale (concise synthesis of the plan's logic)
- Long-run optionality: META’s AI-driven monetization (ads, payments, creator tools, commerce) paired with a durable data moat supports durable upside even if near-term profits wobble.
- Balance sheet and capital discipline: Strong liquidity and cash flow reduce downside risk and fund AI-related growth without sacrificing shareholder value.
- Entry framework supports disciplined timing: The plan advocates a data-confirmed, staged entry to align with actual uptrends rather than hype, reducing the risk of premature exposure.

Immediate action plan (how to execute now)
- Starter position: Initiate a small starter position of about 2% of your equity portfolio today, contingent on entering with a data-confirmed entry plan.
- Data-confirmed entry criteria (to guide incremental adds):
  - Price above both 50-day and 200-day moving averages (trend-aligned).
  - MACD bullish momentum (MACD line above signal, positive histogram).
  - RSI in a non-overbought range (roughly 40–70; prefer mid-range for room to run).
  - VWMA confirming volume-based strength (price above VWMA or VWMA rising with price).
  - ATR indicates tolerable volatility (not exploding into panic levels).
- If data signals aren’t in place, stay patient on adds and wait for a clear uptrend signal.

Position sizing and risk controls
- Target full exposure: Build toward 4–6% of the portfolio in META over subsequent weeks, but cap total META exposure at 6–7% of the portfolio risk budget.
- Stops and exits:
  - Implement a trailing stop based on 1.5x the 14-day ATR from entry.
  - Trim or exit if price closes below the 50-day MA for two consecutive days or if MACD deteriorates (negative divergence or crosses below signal).
- Hedge consideration: Use a modest protective hedge (e.g., long-dated puts or a collar) to shield the starter position during periods of data blackout or heightened headlines.

Catalysts and monitoring
- Watch for: AI monetization milestones (payments, creator tools, commerce features), core updates (CoreWeave, Rivos), earnings, ad-market trends, and regulatory developments.
- Data cadence: Once data returns, run the 8-indicator framework to time further adds and manage risk actively.

Risk considerations and learnings
- Near-term margin pressure and macro ad-cycle risk are acknowledged; the staged entry and risk controls are designed to shield downside while preserving upside if catalysts meet expectations.
- If data or catalysts disappoint, be prepared to pause adds and/or tighten risk controls rather than forcing exposure.

Bottom line
The plan’s strongest path for META is a measured buy with disciplined, data-driven entry and risk management, leveraging AI-driven monetization optionality while respecting near-term uncertainty.
