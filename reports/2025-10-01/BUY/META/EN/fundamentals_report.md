I attempted to fetch META’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financials, but all data requests returned a FileNotFoundError from the data layer. This indicates the data sources are currently unavailable or misconfigured on my end. I can’t produce the detailed numeric fundamentals until those data pulls succeed.

Here are options to move forward:

1) Retry data calls now (or on a later time): I can re-attempt the Finnhub and Simfin pulls as soon as the data layer is accessible again. If you’d like, I can keep trying and notify you when data returns.

2) Proceed with a qualitative, non-numeric analysis now: I can provide a thorough, trader-focused framework for META using widely known public context (business model, competitive positioning, AI/metaverse investments, regulatory risk, monetization trajectory, etc.) without inserting numbers. Once data becomes available, I’ll plug in the actual figures and finalize the report.

3) Prepare the report structure with placeholders: I can deliver a comprehensive report skeleton (sections, rationale, risk flags, and a Markdown table with data fields to be filled). I’ll clearly mark data as “DATA PENDING” so you or another tool can insert the numbers later.

If you’d like me to proceed right away, I recommend option 3 or 2. Here’s what I’ll deliver once data is available (and what I can finalize now with placeholders):

What I will deliver once data is available
- Company profile and business model
  - Core platforms: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Reality Labs, etc.
  - Revenue mix by segment (advertising, payments, other) and geography.
  - Competitive positioning and moat considerations (scale, ad tech stack, ecosystem, AI-driven personalization).

- Core financials (quarterly frequency, with latest quarter as the anchor)
  - Income statement: revenue, gross margin, OPEX, operating income, net income, EPS.
  - Key margins and year-over-year/quarter-over-quarter trends.
  - Cash flows: operating cash flow, capex, free cash flow.
  - Balance sheet: cash & equivalents, debt (net and gross), equity, liquidity ratios.

- Financial history and signals
  - Trailing and forward-looking trend observations (revenue growth rate, margin expansion/contraction, cash conversion).
  - Leverage and liquidity dynamics (debt levels, interest coverage, liquidity runway).

- Insider sentiment and insider transactions
  - Summary of any insider buying/selling signals in the past 15 days (if available).
  - Interpretation: bullish/bearish indicators, potential buy/sell pressure.

- Key ratios and metrics (to compare with peers)
  - Profitability: ROIC/ROA, net margins.
  - Efficiency: FCF yield, ROE, operating margin.
  - Valuation snapshots (P/E, EV/EBITDA, price-to-sales) once current data is present.

- Risk factors and catalysts
  - Regulatory/compliance risk, data privacy, antitrust considerations.
  - Dependence on ad market cycles, platform platform policies, AI-driven monetization potential.
  - Product-cycle risks (new features, metaverse investments) and capital allocation signals.

- Trader-focused takeaways
  - What to watch in the next two quarters (milestones, earnings drivers, guidance range).
  - Potential scenarios based on ad market health, user growth, engagement metrics, and monetization progress.

Markdown table template (to be filled with data when available)
- The table will include fields such as:
  - Revenue (ttm/latest quarter)
  - Net income (latest)
  - Operating margin
  - Free cash flow (ttm)
  - Debt/Equity
  - Cash and cash equivalents
  - Insider sentiment signal (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Notable insider transactions (amount, direction)
  - Key risks
  - Catalysts

Would you like me to proceed with option 2 (qualitative framework) now, or prepare the skeleton with placeholders (option 3) and refresh as soon as the data layer is back online? If you prefer, tell me to retry the data pulls on a specific date/time, and I’ll attempt again.
