I ran into a data retrieval issue trying to fetch META data for 2024-10-01 to 2025-10-01. The get_YFin_data call returned a FileNotFoundError from the backend, so I can’t currently generate the indicator reports directly from live data. I’ve attempted again, but the backend issue persists. If you’d like, I can retry shortly, or we can proceed with a structured framework now and I’ll plug in live readings as soon as the data service is available.

In the meantime, here’s a detailed, practical framework for META (META) using a carefully curated set of up to 8 complementary indicators. This selection emphasizes trend, momentum, volatility, and volume to give a well-rounded view, without redundant overlap.

Selected indicators (8)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale for each indicator and how it helps with META
- close_50_sma (50-day SMA)
  - What it measures: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Look for price direction relative to the 50SMA; a sustained move above suggests a bullish bias, while staying below implies bearish or range-bound conditions. Crossovers with the price can signal potential entries/exits, especially when aligned with other indicators.
  - META context: In a tech/hyper-growth environment, 50SMA can help filter noisy price action and emphasize whether the stock is in a sustainable uptrend vs. a pullback phase.

- close_200_sma (200-day SMA)
  - What it measures: Long-term trend benchmark and overall market regime.
  - How to use: Confirm the macro trend. A price above the 200SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA is often considered a bullish regime; a move below can signal longer-term weakness or a regime shift. Golden/death cross considerations can guide strategic framing rather than timing trades.
  - META context: Helps distinguish secular uptrends in AI/ads monetization narratives from pullbacks due to macro pauses or regulatory news.

- close_10_ema (10-day EMA)
  - What it measures: Short-term momentum and rapid shifts in price action.
  - How to use: Use as a timing filter for entries/exits, especially when it crosses the shorter-term price or the 50SMA. In choppy markets, 10EMA can produce false signals, so require corroboration from longer-term trends.
  - META context: META can show rapid intraday/short-horizon moves around product launches, earnings, and platform changes; 10-EMA helps catch early momentum shifts.

- macd (MACD line)
  - What it measures: Momentum and trend strength via differences of fast/slow EMAs.
  - How to use: Look for MACD line crossovers with the signal line, as well as divergences between price and MACD. Positive MACD and rising momentum support uptrends; negative or converging momentum supports consolidation or reversal scenarios.
  - META context: Helpful to confirm sustained momentum in a stock that often experiences shifts around earnings or platform-related news.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it measures: The smoothed MACD line used for cross-confirmation.
  - How to use: Use MACD line crossing above/below itself as a trade trigger aligned with MACD direction. It reduces false positives if used with price direction and other indicators.
  - META context: Adds a firmer signal layer to momentum analyses, especially around volatility spikes.

- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - What it measures: Price momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
  - How to use: Traditional thresholds are 70/30, but in strong trends RSI can remain extended. Look for divergences between price and RSI as potential reversal signals. Confirm with trend direction (50/200SMA, MACD).
  - META context: In buoyant uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; use RSI in conjunction with trend indicators to avoid premature sells.

- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it measures: Market volatility.
  - How to use: Use ATR to set dynamic stop losses and adjust position sizing to reflect current volatility. Rising ATR indicates higher volatility, which may warrant wider stops; falling ATR supports tighter risk parameters.
  - META context: META’s volatility tends to expand around earnings, regulatory headlines, or product announcements. ATR helps manage risk in such regimes.

- vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
  - What it measures: Price action filtered by volume, giving a sense of true momentum.
  - How to use: Confirm price moves with volume. A price move above a rising VWMA with increasing volume is typically stronger than a move on light volume. Divergences between price and VWMA can warn of weakening momentum even as price trends.
  - META context: Meta’s moves often accompany changes in user engagement or ad-market conditions; VWMA helps verify whether price changes are supported by solid volume participation.

How to interpret signals for META using this set
- Bullish framework (examples of aligned signals)
  - Price above 200SMA, and price above 50SMA.
  - 10EMA crosses above price or remains above long-term averages.
  - MACD line above the MACDS line with rising MACD histogram.
  - RSI rising but not sharply overbought; price makes higher highs with momentum.
  - ATR rising modestly, indicating expanding but manageable volatility.
  - VWMA rising with price, confirming volume-backed move.

- Bearish framework (examples of aligned signals)
  - Price below 200SMA and below 50SMA.
  - 10EMA crossing below price or crossing below longer-term averages.
  - MACD below MACDS with negative histogram.
  - RSI failing around or dipping below midline with potential bearish divergence.
  - ATR rising on downside moves indicating higher risk or volatility in the decline.
  - VWMA lagging price or showing weak volume on price declines.

- Neutral/sideways framework
  - Price hugging both SMAs with narrow ranges.
  - MACD around zero; MACD histogram near zero.
  - RSI hovering around 40–60 without clear momentum direction.
  - ATR at lower bounds, indicating low volatility; VWMA flat.

Trade planning considerations for META with this framework
- Trend confirmation first: rely on close_50_sma and close_200_sma to establish the broader regime before acting on momentum signals (macd/macds and 10EMA cross).
- Momentum timing: use macd and macds together with RSI to time entries when momentum confirms the price trend, not in isolation.
- Risk management: use ATR to set stops; consider dynamic position sizing as volatility changes around earnings or regulatory news.
- Volume validation: use VWMA to confirm that price moves have solid volume behind them, reducing the risk of false breakouts.
- Event sensitivity: around earnings, product announcements, or policy changes, expect spikes in volatility (ATR) and potential shifts in trend; use the above indicators to distinguish breakout validity from noise.

Note on data availability
- I attempted to fetch META data for 2024-10-01 through 2025-10-01, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry the data retrieval now or on your confirmation. If you’d prefer, I can proceed with this framework and re-run the indicators as soon as the data source is accessible.

Proposed next steps
- Option A (preferred): I retry get_YFin_data for META now and then generate the 8-indicator report, followed by a precise commentary on current readings, cross-checks, and actionable signals.
- Option B: If you want immediate reasoning now, I can provide a more detailed META-centered narrative tied to typical patterns for 2025-10-01 using this framework, with hypothetical interpretations that you can adjust once real data is available.

Appendix: quick reference table of the 8 indicators and their role
| Indicator | What it measures | How to use in META context | Interpretation guidance for META |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Trend direction; signal reliability with price crossovers | Use to gauge whether META is in an uptrend or downtrend; pair with longer-term context |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend; macro regime | Confirms macro direction; golden/death-cross signals | Indicates strategic trend framework; not for frequent entries alone |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Timely momentum signals; works as a timing filter | Watch for quick shifts; validate with longer averages |
| macd | Momentum/trend strength | Crossover and histogram signals; divergences | Positive momentum supports uptrends; beware of false positives in low-volatility regimes |
| macds | MACD signal line | Cross with MACD for triggers; confirmation tool | Reduces false positives when used with price and RSI |
| rsi | Momentum; overbought/oversold | Thresholds (30/70); divergences | Strong uptrends can keep RSI high; use in conjunction with trend |
| atr | Volatility | Stop placement and position sizing; volatility-based risk | Rising ATR signals higher risk—adjust stops and sizing accordingly |
| vwma | Volume-adjusted price action | Confirm moves with volume; validate breakouts | Up moves with rising VWMA are more robust than price moves on low volume |

If you’d like me to retry data retrieval now and then provide a full, data-driven 8-indicator META report, say “Retry data” and I’ll attempt again and produce a detailed, live-reading assessment.
