I tried to fetch GOOGL data for 2024-10-01 to 2025-10-01, but I’m hitting a FileNotFoundError from the data backend. It looks like a system issue retrieving the Yahoo Finance CSV. I can retry now, or proceed with a robust indicator framework so you’re ready as soon as data becomes available. Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan and a curated set of indicators tailored for GOOGL.

Selected indicators (8, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these 8 indicators are suitable for GOOGL
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to gauge the prevailing trend and to confirm signals from faster indicators.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps assess the broader regime (bullish/bearish) and spot golden/death cross setups with the 50SMA.
- close_10_ema: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts in price action and potential entry/exit points when paired with longer-timeframe signals.
- macd: Core momentum measure via the difference between two EMAs. Useful for identifying trend changes through line crossovers and divergence.
- macds: The MACD signal line (smoother), helping to confirm MACD crossovers and reduce false entries when used with the MACD line.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator to flag overbought/oversold levels and divergences. Effective when used with trend filters from the SMAs.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA). Establishes a dynamic baseline for price and helps frame breakouts and mean-reversion expectations when used with the bands.
- atr: Volatility measure to gauge risk and set stops/position sizes. Reactive but essential for risk management, especially around FOMC dates, earnings, or major tech-sector shifts.

How to interpret these indicators together (general framework)
- Trend alignment:
  - Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA signals a bullish regime; a 50SMA crossing above 200SMA (golden cross) would reinforce a bullish setup.
  - Price below both SMAs indicates bearish risk; watch for a potential reversal if price breaks above the 50SMA and eventually the 200SMA.
- Momentum and timing:
  - MACD line above MACD signal with a positive histogram supports a bullish momentum tilt; look for convergence with price strength on pullbacks.
  - Price crossing above the 10 EMA while MACD/upward momentum is confirmed increases the likelihood of a short-term entry opportunity.
- Momentum durability vs. overextension:
  - RSI rising toward overbought (around 70) alongside strong trend signals may indicate a risk of a pullback; watch for bearish divergences with price as a warning sign.
  - RSI near the midline or rising from oversold, combined with a bullish MACD, can support a continuation setup on dips toward the 50SMA.
- Volatility and risk management:
  - ATR rising suggests expanding volatility; position sizing and stop distances should be increased accordingly to avoid premature stops.
  - Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) with price touching/holding near the upper band may signal sustained strength in trends, whereas a move toward the lower band could hint at reversions or consolidation.
- Entry/exit framing:
  - Use pullbacks to the 50SMA or the 10 EMA as potential entry zones when price is above trend filters (50SMA/200SMA) and MACD is positive.
  - Use ATR to set dynamic stop losses (e.g., multiple of ATR) to adapt to current volatility.
  - Bollinger bands can help time exits on overextended moves or confirm breakout/mean-reversion cases when combined with MACD and RSI.

What I’d do once data is retrievable
- Compute the eight indicators for GOOGL over the full date range.
- Check for:
  - Crosses: 50SMA above/below 200SMA; price crossing above/below 10 EMA.
  - MACD crossovers and histogram momentum changes.
  - RSI readings and divergence signals.
  - Bollinger framework: price relative to middle band and bands.
  - ATR levels to adjust risk management rules.
- Synthesize into a concise read on whether the current setup is bullish, neutral, or bearish, and propose potential entry/exit levels with risk parameters.

Next steps
- Retry data retrieval now, or provide a date range you prefer (e.g., align with earnings or a recent window).
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a parallel fetch of the 8 indicators (via stockstats indicators) once the data backend is accessible, and then deliver a detailed, data-backed trend report.

Key points at a glance
- Data fetch status: Temporary data backend error (FileNotFoundError). Retry recommended.
- Indicator set (recommended): 8 indicators as listed above to balance trend, momentum, volatility, and risk.
- Output you’ll get after successful data fetch: A nuanced trend report with precise readings for GOOGL and a Markdown table of the key signals and suggested actions.

Markdown table: Key indicators and trading interpretation (GOOGL)
- Indicator: close_50_sma
  Purpose: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance
  What to watch: Price above 50SMA with 50SMA above 200SMA suggests bullish bias; cross of 50SMA above 200SMA strengthens the bullish case.
- Indicator: close_200_sma
  Purpose: Long-term trend benchmark
  What to watch: Price trading above 200SMA supports a bullish regime; sustained movement below may indicate a bearish/low-confidence environment.
- Indicator: close_10_ema
  Purpose: Short-term momentum
  What to watch: Price crossing above 10EMA signals near-term strength; pullbacks to 10EMA can offer entries in a bullish trend.
- Indicator: macd
  Purpose: Momentum trend changes
  What to watch: MACD line above MACD signal with positive histogram supports ongoing upside momentum; a bearish cross warns of potential reversals.
- Indicator: macds
  Purpose: MACD signal confirmation
  What to watch: MACD signal crossovers aligning with MACD line movements reinforce signals; divergence patterns add early warning signs.
- Indicator: rsi
  Purpose: Momentum strength and reversal risk
  What to watch: RSI approaching 70 may indicate overbought risk; near 30 indicates oversold conditions; watch for divergences to anticipate reversals.
- Indicator: boll
  Purpose: Baseline for price movement; breakout/mean-reversion cue
  What to watch: Price riding the upper band suggests strength; consolidation near the middle with band squeeze can precede breakouts or reversals.
- Indicator: atr
  Purpose: Volatility and risk management
  What to watch: Rising ATR implies higher volatility and larger stop distances; falling ATR signals consolidation and tighter risk controls may be appropriate.
