Summary verdict: Buy. Proceed with a staged, risk-controlled long exposure to GOOGL, using the qualitative framework now and ready to switch to a data-backed eight-indicator read as soon as data returns.

Rationale (condensed)
- Bull case strengths: AI monetization across ads, YouTube, and Cloud could lift yield and support margin expansion over time; Alphabet’s moat, ecosystem, and buyback flexibility provide optionality and downside support.
- Bear risks are real (regulatory, data-privacy costs, ad-cycle sensitivity, cloud competition), but these can be managed with disciplined sizing, hedges, and a staged entry.
- Given the plan’s emphasis on multi-channel AI upside and prudent risk controls, a measured, gradual exposure is favorable.

Actionable steps (immediate to near-term)
1) Position initialization (today)
- Start a modest starter position: 1–2% of portfolio allocated to GOOGL.
- Entry approach: if price is near a visible trend-support / consolidation zone, place a limit order; otherwise use a tiered entry (pullback entry, then breakout with volume, then subsequent validation).

2) Risk management and downside protection
- Use ATR-based stops: initial stop at 1.5x–2x the stock’s ATR from entry.
- Position cap: limit total GOOG exposure to no more than 5% of the portfolio.
- Hedging: consider a downside hedge (e.g., long-dated puts or a collar) to protect against macro or monetization delays if cost is acceptable.

3) Scaling into the position (conditional)
- If AI monetization signals strengthen (better ad yield, YouTube monetization progress, cloud-margin traction) and price action confirms, add 2nd tranche up to a total exposure of 3–4%.
- Use confirmatory indicators (volume, momentum, and risk metrics) before each incremental add.

4) Data and signals framework (Track B now; Track A when ready)
- Implement a qualitative read immediately due to data hiccup.
- Plan to switch to a data-backed eight-indicator read (Track A) as soon as data returns; adjust sizing and timing accordingly.

5) Profit-taking and exits
- Take partial profits on meaningful rallies (e.g., 15–25% from entry) with indicators in your favor; raise stops to lock in gains.
- If AI monetization signals deteriorate or regulatory headlines worsen, trim or exit and reallocate.

6) Review cadence
- Reassess thesis quarterly with focus on AI monetization progress, cloud-margin trajectory, and regulatory developments.

Bottom line
- Buy: initiate a staged, disciplined long exposure to GOOGL with risk controls and hedging where appropriate. The thesis centers on AI-enabled monetization potential across Alphabet’s core engines, supported by a durable moat and buyback-driven value support, while remaining mindful of bear risks through disciplined risk management.
