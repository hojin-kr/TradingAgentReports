Thanks for your patience. I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for GOOGL dated 2025-10-01, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend path/config issue). That means I can’t pull the Reddit data right now. I can either retry shortly or proceed with an alternative approach. Here are the options and what I’ll do in each:

Options to proceed
- Retry now: I’ll retry the Reddit data pull immediately and then produce a comprehensive weekly report once the data comes back.
- Proceed without Reddit data: I’ll deliver a thorough sentiment/news framework using other publicly available sources (press releases, earnings news, product announcements, policy/regulatory context) and clearly label any sentiment insights as not Reddit-derived. I can still deliver a robust trader-focused analysis and a Markdown table at the end.
- You provide data: If you can share a brief set of Reddit posts or a link to a dataset, I’ll analyze that directly and integrate it into the report.

What I can deliver right now (without Reddit data)
- A structured long-form analysis framework for GOOGL (Alphabet) covering sentiment drivers, recent news impact, and trader implications for the past week.
- Key questions I will answer (once data is in): What topics are driving sentiment (AI, ad market, cloud, YouTube, regulatory risk, leadership commentary)? Are there any recurring themes or event-driven spikes? How does sentiment align with price/volume action and recent news?
- A clear set of actionable insights for traders (risk signals, catalysts, potential entry/exit windows, and risk management notes).

Proposed structure of the long report (to be completed once data is available)
- Executive snapshot: high-level sentiment trend, notable news events, and immediate implications for L/T positioning.
- Daily sentiment stream (Reddit and other sources if available): positive vs negative, hot topics, notable spikes, and potential causal events.
- News and catalysts: earnings timing signals, AI/product updates, regulatory developments, antitrust discussions, cloud/commercial performance, YouTube monetization, leadership commentary.
- Thematic analysis: AI integration, ad revenue resilience, cost controls, capital allocation (share repurchase, dividends, investment in Cloud/AI), geopolitical/regulatory risk.
- Market implications for traders:
  - Short-term volatility drivers to watch (earnings cycle, regulatory rulings, major product announcements).
  - Medium-term themes (AI roadmap execution, Google Cloud growth, YouTube monetization).
  - Risk factors (regulatory risk, ad market softness, competition, macro sensitivity).
- Sentiment-to-price interpretation: how sentiment patterns typically map to price moves for Alphabet and what anomalies to watch this week.
- Key takeaways and actionable recommendations: positioning guidance with caveats and risk controls.
- Appendix: methodology, data sources, and caveats.

Markdown table (at the end)
I’ll append a concise table organizing the core points for easy reference (to be populated with the actual data once the Reddit feed is available).

| Aspect | What to look for | Trader implications | Data status (pending or available) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Daily sentiment | Positive/negative tilt; main topics | Signals for momentum trades; watch for red flags | Pending (Reddit data) |
| Hot topics | AI, ad market, cloud, YouTube, regulatory risk | Identify catalysts and timing for trades | Pending (Reddit data) |
| News catalysts | Earnings timing, product launches, policy updates | Potential price moves; risk events to hedge | Pending (Reddit data) |
| Price-action alignment | Sentiment vs. price/volume patterns | Validate or refute sentiment-driven trades | Pending (Reddit data) |
| Key risks | Regulatory actions; antitrust developments; macro headwinds | Risk management and hedging considerations | Pending (Reddit data) |

Next steps
- Tell me which path you prefer: retry the Reddit data pull now, proceed with the alternative approach, or provide data you’d like me to analyze.
- If you want me to proceed without Reddit data for now, I’ll deliver the full report focused on sentiment and news from non-Reddit sources, followed by the same Markdown table structure and trader-oriented insights.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data pull immediately, or should I proceed with a Reddit-free comprehensive report using other sources?
