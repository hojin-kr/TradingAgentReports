Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest TSLA Reddit stock data for 2025-10-01, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError (backend issue). I can retry in the next turn, or we can switch to a broader sentiment/news analysis using non-Reddit sources for the same timeframe. Here are two options you can choose from, plus a solid plan for moving forward.

Option A — Retry Reddit data now (if you’d like me to keep trying)
- I’ll re-attempt the Reddit stock info pull for TSLA on 2025-10-01, then incorporate those Reddit threads and posts into a detailed sentiment and trend analysis.
- If the tool comes back with data, I’ll produce a comprehensive long-form report with daily sentiment breakdown, prominent themes, and trading implications.

Option B — Proceed with non-Reddit sources only
- I’ll analyze Tesla (TSLA) sentiment and news for the past 7 days using available public sources other than Reddit (e.g., major financial news outlets, corporate announcements, X/Twitter sentiment, StockTwits, YouTube/commentary signals, and notable blogs).
- I’ll provide a thorough, trader-focused report with granular findings, key themes, and actionable implications.

If you’d like, I can proceed with Option B right away and deliver a complete report. In either case, I’ll include a structured Makrdown table at the end summarizing the key points.

Plan for the final report (whether Reddit data is included or not)
- Executive snapshot: What the sentiment landscape looks like for TSLA over the past week, balance of bullish vs bearish signals, and any notable shifts.
- Daily sentiment breakdown: A day-by-day view of sentiment, notable posts/news, and potential drivers (earnings chatter, production updates, China/EV competition, regulatory news, etc.).
- Thematic deep dives: 
  - Vehicle demand expectations and delivery/trend signals
  - Autopilot/FSD developments and beta program sentiment
  - Energy/storage news and profitability signals
  - Capital markets color (guidance, margins, capex, Tesla AI/intelligence stream)
  - Competitive/macro factors (EV pricing, consumer demand, supply chain chatter)
- Notable sources and signal strength: Which outlets or platforms are driving sentiment, with a rough confidence score.
- Sentiment vs price correlation: Any observed relationships between sentiment shifts and TSLA price moves or volume over the week.
- Risk factors and caveats: Possible biases in social sentiment, data limitations, and notable counterarguments.
- Trading implications: Short-term posture (intraday/next few days) vs. longer-term positioning, identifying scenarios where sentiment might flip on catalysts.
- Quick-hit takeaways for traders: 5–7 bullet conclusions and watchpoints.

Proposed Makrdown table (structure ready to fill)
- I will populate this table with concrete data once I run the data gathering (or immediately if you confirm Option A or B).

| Source | Date | Net Sentiment | Dominant Theme | Notable Posts/News | Confidence / Signal Quality |
|--------|------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Example: Reddit/Twitter/News | 2025-09-25 | Bullish | AI/Autopilot progress | “Tesla FSD beta update...” | Medium-High |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Please tell me which option you prefer (A to retry Reddit now, or B to proceed with non-Reddit sources). If you want me to proceed with Option B immediately, I’ll deliver the full report in a single response.
