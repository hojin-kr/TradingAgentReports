I’m running into an internal data-access error with the required data tools right now (FileNotFoundError from all requested endpoints). I can’t pull the latest insider sentiment, insider transactions, or SimFin balances/cashflow/income statements for TSLA at the moment. I can still move forward in two ways:

- Option A: I provide a comprehensive, methodology-focused report template and fill in placeholder notes where data is missing, so you have a ready-to-fill framework for when the data tools are available again.
- Option B: I proceed with a qualitative, data-light fundamentals overview using publicly known context (without exact figures) and clearly mark where data would be needed to complete the picture.

Please tell me which you prefer. In the meantime, here is a thorough, trader-focused report framework you can use, plus a Markdown table at the end to organize key points once data is filled in.

Comprehensive framework for TSLA fundamental analysis (to be populated with data when tools are available)

1) Executive snapshot
- What we want to know: recent momentum, key catalysts, and the implied risk/reward setup.
- Data to populate: latest quarter revenue, profitability, cash flow, and major strategic developments (production ramps, new models or markets, energy/AI initiatives). Note any one-off items or unusual charges.

2) Company profile
- Business description: core segments (Automotive, Energy, Services), geographic exposure (US, China, Europe), and production footprint (facilities, capacities, recent expansions).
- Business model notes: pricing power, mix shifts (EV vs. software/services), aftermarket revenue, and competitive landscape.
- Management and governance: CEO/ CFO track record, R&D intensity, capital allocation philosophy.

3) Recent financial snapshot (quarterly focus; fill in exact figures when available)
- Income statement highlights (quarterly): revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income, operating margin, net income, EPS, unusual items.
- Balance sheet highlights (quarterly): total assets, cash & equivalents, accounts receivable/payable, debt levels, equity, working capital.
- Cash flow highlights (quarterly): operating cash flow, investing cash flow, financing cash flow, free cash flow.
- Key profitability and liquidity metrics: gross margin trend, operating margin trend, net margin, ROE/ROA, cash conversion cycle, current ratio, debt/EBITDA if available.

4) Financial history (trend analysis)
- Revenue trajectory: multi-quarter/years growth rate, by segment if possible.
- Margin progression: gross, operating, and net margins over time; impact of price/mass-market mix.
- Cash flow trends: FCF evolution, capital expenditure cadence, and any financings or buybacks.
- Balance sheet evolution: leverage changes, liquidity headroom, and repayment schedules.

5) Insider sentiment (past 15 days)
- What to capture: bullish vs. bearish tone, any notable statements about expectations, concerns, or catalysts.
- Sources: SEC filings, company disclosures, and credible financial data providers.
- Potential signals: increased optimism with stock activity, or growing skepticism reflected in hedging behavior or diluted expectations.

6) Insider transactions (past 15 days)
- What to capture: any purchases or sales by executives or board members, size of trades, holdings before/after, and any patterns (e.g., multiple insiders buying on the same day).
- Interpretation: consistent insider buying can signal confidence; large or repeated selling may warrant closer scrutiny unless well-justified (tax planning, diversification, or planned financing).

7) Key catalysts and risks (short- to medium-term)
- Catalysts: product launches, capacity expansions, gross margin inflection points, regulatory or energy-market developments, AI/software monetization.
- Risks: demand cyclicality, competition (legacy automakers, new entrants), supply chain risks, price/commodity pressures, and regulatory changes.

8) Valuation context (qualitative starting point)
- Relative multiples comparison (e.g., EV/EBITDA, P/E, P/S) against peers and historical ranges.
- Growth vs. profitability trade-offs: scale benefits from higher volumes vs. investment in capex/R&D.
- Market sentiment: how risk-on/risk-off dynamics might impact TSLA given growth vs. profitability profile.

9) Trading takeaways (actionable points)
- Short-term view: catalysts to watch, potential entry/exit zones (if you have price data), and risk controls.
- Medium-term view: how the fundamental trajectory (milestones, cash flow durability) could influence position sizing.
- Risk management: liquidity considerations, position concentration, and stop-loss/derivative hedging ideas.

10) Appendix and data sources
- Data sources: list the exact data feeds (when available) such as TSLA quarterly filings, investor presentations, insider transaction reports, and the specific SimFin/Finnhub endpoints you rely on.
- Definitions: clarify how metrics are calculated (e.g., free cash flow, operating cash flow, EBITDA proxies) to avoid ambiguity.

Next steps
- If you’d like Option A (framework with placeholder notes), I can deliver this as a polished report you can copy into a document and fill in the data as soon as the tools are back.
- If you’d like Option B (a qualitative overview using public knowledge, without exact figures), I can provide a narrative analysis focusing on Tesla’s strategic positioning, margin drivers, and potential catalysts, clearly indicating where numeric data would refine the conclusion.

Please tell me which option you prefer, and I can proceed accordingly. If you want me to retry fetching data now, I can attempt again as soon as the tooling becomes available.
