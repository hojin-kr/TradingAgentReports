I’m seeing a data retrieval issue for TSLA right now. I attempted to fetch the TSLA price data from Yahoo Finance for a recent window, but the data source tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This means I can’t compute the indicator values right this moment. If you’d like, I can retry shortly, or you can authorize proceeding with a data-less, qualitative framework until the data fetch is working again.

In the meantime, here is a robust set of up to 8 indicators that provide complementary, non-redundant insights for TSLA in a late-2025 context (trending into Q4), focusing on trend, momentum, and volatility. Once the data fetch is successful, I’ll compute and report the actual readings.

Recommended indicators (8 total)
- close_10_ema
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these are suitable
- close_10_ema: Captures short-term momentum and quick shifts in price. Useful for timing entries/filters in a volatile stock like TSLA.
- close_50_sma: Represents intermediate-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps distinguish meaningful moves from noise.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark; helps confirm major trend direction and filter trades (e.g., avoiding counter-trend entries in a bull/bear phase).
- macd: Momentum trend indicator; crossovers can signal changes in momentum. Useful in conjunction with price action and trend confirms.
- macds: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD help trigger trade signals and improve timing when used with other filters.
- macdh: MACD histogram; shows momentum strength and potential divergences earlier than crossovers, aiding in early warnings.
- rsi: Momentum strength indicator with overbought/oversold cues. Helps identify potential reversals, but use with trend context to avoid false signals in strong trends.
- atr: Measures volatility to inform risk management (position sizing, stop placement). Important for TSLA given its occasionally wide intraday moves and gaps.

Next steps
- I’ll retry data retrieval for TSLA on the requested window and, if successful, compute and present a detailed report using the 8 indicators above.
- If you prefer, I can also run a broader set (up to 8 indicators total, no more) with different emphasis (e.g., swap ATR for boll_ub/boll_lb if you want volatility bands).

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now, or proceed with the qualitative/trend narrative using these indicators as a framework and wait for the data to come back?

Key points table (for quick reference)
| Indicator | Category | What it tells you | How to use for TSLA (context) |
|-----------|----------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum, quick shifts | Signal entry/exit timing; confirm with longer-term MA trends |
| close_50_sma  | Moving Average | Intermediate trend direction | Trend confirmation; watch for price crossing as a dynamic support/resistance |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend direction | Major trend confirmation; use to filter entries in bull/bear regimes |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend change signals | Crossovers indicate potential trend shifts; use with trend context |
| macds | MACD Related | MACD signal line behavior | Cross with MACD for trigger points; helps reduce false positives |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergences | Divergences can warn of weakening momentum ahead of price moves |
| rsi | Momentum Indicator | Overbought/oversold and momentum strength | 70/30 thresholds; watch for divergence in context of trend |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility levels; risk management | Set stop loss and position size with current volatility; adjust to TSLA’s move size |

If you want, I can also prepare a follow-up with a full, data-driven report as soon as the data fetch problem is resolved.
