Recommendation: SELL NFLX (or materially reduce exposure) now.

Rationale aligned with the provided plan and current risk signals
- Bear-case risks are material in the near term: subs growth deceleration, international churn risk, and pricing sensitivity amid macro uncertainty. Monetization levers (ads, price increases) carry execution risk and may not land as smoothly as hoped.
- Margin and cash-flow sensitivity: even with potential ad revenue gains and library amortization, a slower-than-expected monetization path could pressure margins and free cash flow, which are key supports for valuation.
- Competitive and regulatory headwinds: intensified competition (Disney+, Prime Video, Apple) and potential ad-market/regulatory constraints could cap upside and compress multiples.
- Valuation risk in a macro backdrop: a premium multiple embedded in the stock price is vulnerable if monetization progress disappoints or if costs reaccelerate, creating downside risk vs upside from incremental ARPU gains alone.

Concrete actions to implement the Sell thesis
- Position reduction: Trim NFLX by a meaningful percentage of the existing holding now to lock in gains and reduce tail-risk exposure.
- Hedging options (if applicable): Consider protective hedges such as near-the-money puts with a 1â€“3 month horizon, or implement a collar to cap downside while preserving upside optionality.
- Stop and risk controls: Establish a trailing exit that triggers on a close below the 50-day SMA after a rally or on a break of a key support level. Define a clear re-entry framework rather than attempting a full-blown re-accumulation now.
- Data-driven monitoring: Track subs growth rate, churn, ARPU by tier, ad-tier take rate, and content ROI. If subs accelerate meaningfully, ARPU uplifts prove durable, and cash-flow improves alongside margins, re-evaluate the stance.
- Portfolio hygiene: Rebalance toward lower-beta tech or diversified cash-flowing growth names to reduce single-name risk. Consider substitutes with clearer near-term catalysts or more predictable ad monetization dynamics.
- Review cadence: Schedule a quarterly review to test the bear thesis against new data and earnings guidance. Be prepared to tighten or ease exposure as signals evolve.

Re-entry framework (for planning if the bear case proves too pessimistic)
- Triggers for potential re-entry: sustained subs growth acceleration, durable ARPU uplift, confirmed margin expansion and free cash-flow inflection, plus constructive guidance from management. Enter in staged increments rather than all at once, and rely on price-action signals and volume momentum.

 FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
