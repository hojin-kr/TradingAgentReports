Sorry about that—the Reddit stock info tool returned a FileNotFoundError, which looks like a backend issue (not something caused by your input). I’m unable to fetch the latest Reddit-based sentiment data for NFLX right now.

 options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can try calling the tool again for NFLX on 2025-10-01 or a nearby date to see if the backend issue clears.
- Try a fallback: If you have any headlines or snippets from Reddit (or other social sources) you want me to analyze, paste them here and I’ll build a detailed sentiment/impact report.
- Proceed without live Reddit data: I can outline a comprehensive NFLX sentiment and news framework and draft a long-form report based on typical drivers (subscriber trends, pricing changes, content strategy, competition, macro factors) and clearly mark where live data would be inserted once the tool is functioning.

Please tell me which option you prefer, or authorize a retry and I’ll attempt again immediately.
