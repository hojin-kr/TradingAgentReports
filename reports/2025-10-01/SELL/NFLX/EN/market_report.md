I attempted to fetch NFLX data and compute the indicators, but the tool environment returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t retrieve the data right now to generate the exact indicator values and a data-backedTrend report. If you’d like, I can retry shortly, or proceed with a carefully chosen indicator set and a detailed framework you can apply once the data loads. Here’s a robust, complementary 8-indicator package tailored for NFLX, along with why each is suitable and how to interpret them once you have the data.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
1) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why it’s here: Medium-term trend direction and a dynamic support/resistance level. Helps filter noisy entries by confirming the broader trend.
- How to use: Look for price trading above the 50SMA for bullish bias; pullbacks to the 50SMA can act as potential entry points in uptrends. Crosses of price below/above 50SMA can signal trend shifts when aligned with other signals.

2) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why it’s here: Long-term trend benchmark; helps identify major regime direction and potential golden/death cross signals when combined with smaller moving averages.
- How to use: Price above the 200SMA generally supports a bullish regime; price below can indicate a broader downtrend. Use in conjunction with 50SMA for trend confirmation (e.g., price above both, or a 50/200 cross).

3) close_10_ema
- Category: Moving Averages
- Why it’s here: Short-term momentum capture; more responsive than the SMAs, helpful for timely entries or quick trend shifts.
- How to use: Price crossing above/below the 10EMA can signal near-term momentum changes. Use with the 50SMA/200SMA to reduce whipsaws in choppy markets.

4) macd
- Category: MACD Related
- Why it’s here: Core momentum indicator; captures shifts in momentum via the divergence of two EMAs.
- How to use: Watch for MACD line crossovers with the signal line, and for bullish/bearish divergences against price trends. Confirm with price/action and other indicators to avoid false positives in low-volatility periods.

5) macds
- Category: MACD Related
- Why it’s here: The MACD Signal line; smoother view of momentum changes; helps time entries when MACD line crossovers might be noisy.
- How to use: Use MACD vs. MACD Signal crossovers as trigger signals in alignment with price trend (e.g., MACD crossing above the signal in uptrends).

6) rsi
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- Why it’s here: Momentum gauge with clear overbought/oversold cues; helps identify retracements and potential reversals.
- How to use: Typical thresholds: RSI over 70 = overbought, below 30 = oversold. In strong trends, markets can stay extended; use RSI in conjunction with trend indicators (50SMA/200SMA) to avoid chasing counter-trend moves.

7) atr
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- Why it’s here: Measures current volatility to inform risk management and stop placement; essential for position sizing in NFLX’s often volatile price action.
- How to use: Use ATR to calibrate stop distances (e.g., several ATRs away from entry). Rising ATR signals expanding volatility (risk) and may warrant wider stops; shrinking ATR may warrant tighter risk controls.

8) vwma
- Category: Volume-Based Indicators
- Why it’s here: Combines price action with volume to confirm the strength of moves; helps validate breakouts and trend continuation.
- How to use: Look for price moves that are supported by rising VWMA relative to price; divergence between price and VWMA can flag weakening momentum. Use with price and MACD/RSI to confirm signals.

How to interpret NFLX signals once data is available
- Trend confirmation: If price is above both 50SMA and 200SMA, with the 50SMA trending above the 200SMA (and VWMA confirming with volume), the bias favors long entries on pullbacks or breakouts.
- Momentum timing: MACD/macd/macs crossovers aligned with RSI moving away from neutral (toward 60–70 for uptrends) strengthen entry signals. In choppy markets, rely more on trend and volatility signals (ATR) to avoid false positives.
- Volatility and risk: ATR rising suggests wider price swings; adjust stop distances accordingly. A compressing ATR with a breakout through resistance (and VWMA confirming volume) can indicate a sustainable move.
- Volume confirmation: VWMA rising with price advances supports a durable move; weakness in VWMA during up moves may warn of a potential pullback or exhaustion.

Next steps
- I can re-run the data fetch and generate a live, data-backed analysis with the eighth-indicator combinations above and a detailed trend/trade/distribution view. If you’d like, I can retry now or wait a short period and try again.
- If you prefer, I can proceed with a hypothetical illustrative interpretation based on typical NFLX behavior, but I recommend waiting for actual data to avoid misleading conclusions.

Markdown table: key points to remember
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for NFLX signals |
|---|---|---|---|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Use with price above/below for trend bias; pullbacks to 50SMA as potential entries in uptrends |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above/below 200SMA signals regime; watch for 50SMA/200SMA cross for trend shifts |
| close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum | Crosses with price indicate near-term momentum shifts; filter with longer MA trends |
| macd | MACD | Momentum via EMA differences | Look for MACD line vs. Signal crossovers and divergences; confirm with price trend |
| macds | MACD | MACD Signal line (smoothed) | Use crossovers with MACD for entry signals; rely on broader trend confirmation before acting |
| rsi | Momentum | Overbought/oversold momentum | RSI >70/ <30 signals potential reversals; consider trend context to avoid false signals |
| atr | Volatility | Market volatility (range) | Set stops and size by ATR; rising ATR = larger stops, more caution; falling ATR = tighter risk control |
| vwma | Volume-Based | Price action filtered by volume | Confirm moves with rising VWMA; use as volume-backed validation of breakouts or trends |

Notes
- The above indicators are selected to provide complementary views: trend (50/200 SMA), momentum (MACD, RSI), short-term momentum (10 EMA), volatility (ATR), and volume-confirmed trend (VWMA). This mix helps reduce redundancy while delivering a well-rounded read on NFLX’s price dynamics.
- Once I can fetch the data, I’ll deliver a full, data-driven report with the exact indicator values, a nuanced trend assessment, and a summarized decision framework tailored to NFLX as of 2025-10-01.

Would you like me to retry fetching NFLX data now, or would you prefer I proceed with the outlined framework and come back with the data-backed numbers as soon as the fetch succeeds?
