I tried to fetch SPY data and the requested indicators, but the data retrieval failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the environment. Specifically, attempts to call get_YFin_data and the indicator reports returned errors. I can retry as soon as the data source is available, or I can adjust the date range or settings to work around the issue. If you’d like, I can retry now or try a shorter window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to get a quick read once the data pipeline is restored.

In the meantime, here is a carefully chosen, complementary set of indicators I would use for SPY (up to 8), along with why they’re suitable for a broad, robust view of the market condition on 2025-10-01:

Selected indicators (8)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- atr
- vwma

Rationale and how each helps
- close_50_sma (50-day simple moving average)
  - What it tells you: The medium-term trend direction and potential dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why useful now: Helps confirm the prevailing trend when used with faster signals; a 50-SMA crossover with price can indicate a shift in momentum.

- close_200_sma (200-day simple moving average)
  - What it tells you: The long-term trend baseline; a test of the long-run price level and potential golden/death cross signals.
  - Why useful now: For SPY, staying above/below the 200-SMA is a strong macro-directional signal; useful for framing risk with longer horizons.

- close_10_ema (10-day exponential moving average)
  - What it tells you: Short-term momentum and quicker trend shifts than simple averages.
  - Why useful now: Can flag early entries/exits in a trending or choppy market; complements the slower SMA signals.

- macd (MACD line)
  - What it tells you: Momentum and potential trend-change signals via MACD crossovers.
  - Why useful now: A MACD line crossing the signal or moving toward/away from zero can indicate shifts in momentum, particularly when aligned with price action.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it tells you: Momentum strength and divergence signals; the gap between MACD and its signal.
  - Why useful now: Provides a visual gauge of momentum acceleration or deceleration and helps spot early subtle divergences when MACD crosses may be late.

- rsi (Relative Strength Index)
  - What it tells you: Momentum strength and overbought/oversold conditions; potential reversals or continuations.
  - Why useful now: In a strong trend, RSI can stay overbought or oversold for extended periods; use with trend context to avoid false reversals.

- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it tells you: Market volatility level; range of price movement and volatility for setting stops/position sizing.
  - Why useful now: Helps calibrate risk management and dynamic stop placement; volatility can inform position sizing in SPY’s typically liquid environment.

- vwma (Volume-Weighted Moving Average)
  - What it tells you: Price action confirmed by volume flow; volume-adjusted trend confirmation.
  - Why useful now: Adds a volume dimension to trend assessment; helps verify the strength behind moves, especially after large volume surges.

Next steps
- I can immediately retry data retrieval to produce the actual data tables and indicator values for SPY on 2025-10-01 (and a look-back window of 180 days as requested). If you want, I can:
  - Retry with the same range (2024-10-01 to 2025-10-01).
  - Or try a shorter window (e.g., last 365 days) to get a rapid read.
  - Or adjust to a different set of indicators (up to 8) if you prefer another combination.

Proposed output format (once data is available)
- A detailed narrative describing the current SPY trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context derived from the 8 indicators above.
- Clear signals for potential entry/exit or monitoring, with caveats about false positives in choppy markets.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the indicators, their role, and the actionable takeaway.

Sample table structure (to be filled with actual values once data is retrieved)
- Indicator | Category | What it signals | Interpretation for SPY on 2025-10-01
- close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend | ...
- close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend | ...

Would you like me to retry fetching SPY data and the 8 indicators now, or would you prefer a smaller window or a revised indicator set? If you authorize, I’ll run the fetch again and then deliver the full, data-backed report with the detailed trend analysis and the final Markdown table.
