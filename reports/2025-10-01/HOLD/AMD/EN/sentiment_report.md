Sorry — I ran into a tooling error pulling Reddit data for AMD. The get_reddit_stock_info call returned a FileNotFoundError, so I don’t have the latest Reddit-sourced sentiment to integrate right now. I can proceed in a couple of ways, and I’ll lay out a full plan and a structured report you can use regardless of the data gap:

What happened
- Tool attempted: get_reddit_stock_info with ticker AMD for date 2025-10-01
- Error: FileNotFoundError (No such file or directory)
- Implication: I don’t have the week-long Reddit sentiment snapshot to include in the analysis at the moment.

What I can do next (options)
- Retry Reddit data pull as soon as the tool is available again.
- If you’d like, I can proceed with a best-effort framework using available public sentiment signals (e.g., general social-media themes, news tone) and clearly label them as placeholders until Reddit data is back.
- Alternatively, you can provide any non-Reddit sentiment data you already have (e.g., a CSV of daily sentiment scores) and I’ll integrate it into the report.

In the meantime, here’s a comprehensive long-form AMD analysis framework and report structure you can use. It’s designed to deliver actionable insights for traders and investors, with careful notes about data sources and how to interpret the signals. I’ve included a Markdown table at the end as requested.

Executive summary (placeholder until Reddit data is loaded)
- Overall sentiment drivers likely center on AI/data-center demand, GPU supply/demand cycles, and competitive positioning against peers.
- Near-term catalysts typically include AI deployment news, semiconductor supply chain updates, earnings around data-center demand, and consumer GPU price cycles.
- Key risks include macro softness, supply/demand imbalances in data-center GPUs, competition, and potential project delays or changes in AI capex cycles.

What to look for in the social media signal (AMD)
- Core themes to track:
  - AI/ML adoption and data-center demand signals (positive if chatter emphasizes cloud AI deployments; negative if delays or capex pullbacks are discussed).
  - Gaming GPU demand and new product chatter (positive if new architectures or price-performance improvements are praised; negative if supply constraints or price pressure dominate).
  - Competitive dynamics (NVIDIA, Intel, other players) and AMD’s market share commentary.
  - Supply chain and manufacturing noise (fab capacity, yields, supplier sentiment).
  - Company-specific catalysts (new product launches, partnerships, earnings commentary).
- Sentiment granularity:
  - Daily sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative) by day.
  - Top keywords and themes by day.
  - Volume spikes around product launches or news items.

What to look for in the news (AMD)
- Data-center / AI acceleration news: partnerships, OEM deals, new EPYC/MI/SD processors, AI inference announcements.
- GPU ecosystem updates: new Radeon GPUs, performance/price-performance shifts, driver/software improvements.
- Supply chain and earnings signals: quarterly results, margin commentary, capital expenditure plans, fab updates (TSMC or other suppliers).
- Regulation and policy impacts: export controls, trade tensions affecting semiconductor supply or pricing dynamics.
- Strategic investments and M&A chatter: any talks or denied rumors that could shift sentiment.

Interpretation guide for traders
- Positive sentiment drivers combined with constructive news may support risk-on moves around data-center AI cycles and GPU refresh times.
- Negative sentiment spikes around supply chain issues or weaker-than-expected AI demand signals could precede drawdowns, especially if macro conditions worsen.
- Be mindful of echo-chamber effects: Reddit and other forums can amplify near-term noise around product launches or price changes; separate durable fundamentals from social chatter.
- Cross-check sentiment with price action:
  - If sentiment improves but the stock falls, look for diverging signals (profit-taking, rotation, or deeper macro factors).
  - If sentiment deteriorates with a stock rally, verify whether there’s a strong fundamental or technical catalyst (e.g., breakout on data-center wins).

Data integration plan (how I’ll present once Reddit data is back)
- Daily sentiment trend: up/down/flat with a simple numeric scale for each day in the past week.
- Top themes per day with short qualitative notes.
- Sentiment vs. price delta: correlation overview (e.g., 1-week lookback).
- News tone highlight: positive/neutral/negative tagging for the week.
- Key catalysts calendar: upcoming events that could shift sentiment (earnings, product launches, regulatory updates).
- Risk checks: notable downside risks to price and sentiment (macro shock, supply constraints, competitor breakthroughs).

Proposed structure of the final long-form report
1) Snapshot: AMD at a glance
   - Business mix overview (data-center/AI, gaming, embedded, etc.)
   - Recent price action context (without overemphasizing near-term moves)
2) Social sentiment deep-dive
   - Reddit (now-likely placeholder until data is loaded)
   - Other social channels (X/Twitter, StockTwits, YouTube comments, forums)
   - Thematic heatmap by day and day-over-day sentiment changes
3) News synthesis (past week)
   - Summary of notable press releases, earnings mentions, partnerships, product updates
   - Tone analysis (positive/neutral/negative)
4) Risk and catalysts
   - Short-term catalysts and risks
   - Scenarios (base, bull, bear) with price and sentiment implications
5) Trading implications
   - Suggested stance ranges (if data supports a stance: Buy/Hold/Sell guidance to be added once sentiment is clear)
   - Entry/exit considerations around catalysts
6) Appendix
   - Methodology notes
   - Data sources and limitations
   - Quick-reference table

Markdown table: Key points summary (structure you can fill with actual data once Reddit data is available)
- Data Source: Reddit sentiment (pending)
- Time Window: Past 7 days (pending)
- Primary Sentiment Trend: Positive / Neutral / Negative (pending)
- Top Themes: AI/data-center demand, gaming GPU cycle, supply chain, competition
- News Tone: Positive / Neutral / Negative (pending)
- Notable Catalysts: Product launches, earnings commentary, partnerships (pending)
- Risks: Macro weakness, supply/demand imbalance, competitive pressure (pending)
- Trading Implications: (pending once data is available)

Request for next steps
- I can retry the Reddit data pull as soon as possible and then deliver the full, data-filled report with the Markdown table appended.
- If you prefer, I can proceed now with the framework, clearly labeling any sections that are data-dependent, and then plug in the Reddit data once it’s accessible.

Would you like me to:
1) retry the Reddit data pull now, or
2) proceed with the full framework in its current form (clearly marking placeholders) and fill in Reddit data as soon as the tool is available again?
