Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch AMD data to compute the indicators, but the data retrieval tool (Yahoo Finance data) returned a FileNotFoundError. That means I can’t generate the actual indicator values right now. I can either retry fetching data, try a different date window, or proceed with a scenario-based, qualitative analysis using the chosen indicators. Which would you prefer? In the meantime, here is a detailed plan and a structured, actionable framework you can use once data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_200_sma
- close_50_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- atr

Why these 8 indicators
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend context (major trend direction, key support/resistance area). Useful for filtering entries in alignment with the primary trend.
- close_50_sma: Mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm sustained momentum when paired with the 200 SMA.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum; reacts quickly to price changes. Useful for timely entries when used with longer-term trend filters.
- macd: Core momentum signal; crossovers and the MACD line’s position relative to zero help identify trend changes.
- macds: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD strengthen entry/exit signals; reduces false positives when used with other filters.
- macdh: Momentum strength via histogram; divergence and histogram slope provide early momentum cues, especially in consolidating or high-velocity moves.
- rsi: Momentum/overbought-oversold context; thresholds around 30/70 (and potential divergences) aid in timing reversals or additions in a trending market.
- atr: Volatility and risk management anchor; sets stop levels and helps adjust position size in line with current volatility.

How to interpret and apply these indicators for AMD (nuanced, market-context aware)
- Trend confirmation (long-term and mid-term)
  - Look for price action to sit above both 200 SMA and 50 SMA for a bullish backdrop; a 50 SMA above the 200 SMA (golden cross) strengthens conviction.
  - If price is between 50 and 200 SMA with bullish MACD momentum, be cautious; the trend may be rotating rather than resuming.

- Momentum timing (entry and exit)
  - When the close_10_ema crosses above close_50_sma (with price above 200 SMA), this signals a potential bullish entry on a short-term shift in momentum.
  - MACD crossing above its signal line (macd > macds with a rising macd) and turning positive (macdh rising) supports a higher-probability entry in the direction of the trend.
  - RSI added confirmation: in an uptrend, RSI rising toward 60-70 can indicate momentum buildup; in a pullback, RSI near 40-50 with signs of stabilization can present a low-risk entry if other filters align.

- Volatility and risk controls (position sizing and stops)
  - Use ATR to set stop distances (e.g., 1.0x–2.0x ATR) to adapt to current volatility. Higher ATR implies wider stop zones; lower ATR implies tighter risk controls.
  - If ATR spikes (volatility increases), consider tightening position sizing or widening stops accordingly to avoid premature stopouts during news-driven moves.

- Overbought/oversold context and potential reversals
  - RSI overbought conditions (near 70+) in a strong uptrend are not a standalone exit signal but warrant caution and look for divergence or weakening MACD/histogram momentum as confirmation.
  - RSI dipping toward 30-40 in a downtrend with MACD confirming momentum can help validate continuation or the start of a bounce when other filters align (e.g., price crossing above a short-term moving average).

- Confirmations and risk of false signals
  - Treat the 8-indicator combo as a grid of confirmations rather than single-criterion triggers. For example, a bullish entry would ideally involve:
    - Price ≥ 50 SMA and ideally above 200 SMA
    - close_10_ema above close_50_sma
    - macd turning positive with rising macdh
    - RSI not in extreme overbought territory (avoid over-optimism)
    - ATR indicating acceptable risk level for the trade size

- Exit/rail signals
  - Consider exiting or reducing risk if MACD turns down, macdh history flattens and turns negative, RSI fails to hold above mid-level after entry, or price breaks below the 50 SMA while the 200 SMA trend remains supporting (indicating a possible trend reversal).
  - Use ATR-based trailing stops to capture extended moves when momentum remains positive.

Qualitative trading plan outline (AMD-specific, once data is available)
- Setup A: Bullish scenario
  - Price above 200 SMA; 50 SMA above 200 SMA; 50 SMA trending up.
  - 10 EMA crosses above 50 SMA; MACD positive with rising histogram; RSI around 50–70 but not extreme; ATR at a moderate to elevated level (indicating room to move).
  - Action: Enter on a pullback to near 10 EMA/short-term support or after a confirmed MACD cross with price above all major moving averages. Use a stop at 1.0x–1.5x ATR below the entry. Target 1.5x–3.0x risk or near a nearby resistance/pass-through area.
- Setup B: Neutral/transition
  - Price around 50–200 SMA with mixed MACD/macd signals and RSI near 40–60.
  - Action: Wait for clearer momentum confirmation or a decisive break above the 50/200 SMA with MACD confirmation; avoid large new positions until signal alignment improves.
- Setup C: Bearish scenario
  - Price below 200 SMA with 50 SMA below 200 SMA; MACD turning negative; RSI rolling toward oversold but may show divergence.
  - Action: Short entries on breakdowns or failed rallies that fail to push above moving averages; set ATR-based stops to control risk.

Data retrieval status and next steps
- I currently don’t have a live data feed to compute these indicators for AMD in the requested window (2024-10-01 to 2025-10-01). If you’d like, I can:
  1) Retry the data fetch immediately.
  2) Try a different window (e.g., last 6–12 months) to get a quicker turnaround.
  3) Proceed with a scenario-based framework using synthetic or historically representative patterns to illustrate how the indicators would align, without real-time values.
  4) Use a smaller subset of indicators if you want a quicker, more tactical view right now.

Proposed final deliverable (once data is retrieved)
- A detailed narrative report of AMD’s trend and momentum, grounded in the 8 indicators listed above, including:
  - The current trend stance (long-term and mid-term)
  - Momentum signals and potential entry/exit points
  - Volatility context and risk management notes
  - A concise, trader-ready set of actionable rules
- A Markdown table summarizing the key points (indicator, purpose, interpretation, AMD-specific cues)

Proposed Markdown table (key points)
- Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use for AMD
- close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend direction | Confirm bullish/bearish regime; use as a core filter
- close_50_sma | Moving Average | Mid-term trend direction | Align entries with 200 SMA; look for golden cross with 200 SMA
- close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum | Trigger quick entries when crossing above longer-term averages
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend changes | Look for bullish cross above zero; confirm with macd histogram
- macds | MACD Signal | MACD signal line | Cross with MACD strengthens entry/exit timing
- macdh | MACD Histogram | Momentum strength | Divergence or histogram slope changes warn of tempo shifts
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Relative strength / momentum | Watch for 30/70 thresholds and divergences to anticipate reversals
- atr | Volatility | Market volatility level and risk | Set stops and size relative to current volatility; adapt trailing stops

If you’d like, I can rerun the data fetch now and then produce the full, data-driven 8-indicator report with precise readings for AMD. Please tell me which option you prefer:
- Retry data fetch now
- Use a different date window
- Proceed with the qualitative framework (no live numbers) and then we’ll plug in live values once available

Your call.
