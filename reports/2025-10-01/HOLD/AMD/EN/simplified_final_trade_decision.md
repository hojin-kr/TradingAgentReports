# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD faces mixed near-term risk. The stance is Hold with staged exposure to capture upside if durable catalysts materialize, and reassess if they don’t.

## Investment Decision
Hold — Moderate confidence. Maintain a modest core position now and look to add only on clear, durable catalysts, then reassess.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term headwinds: Nvidia remains a strong leader in training AI workloads, and regulatory or policy risks could limit growth and margins.
- Long-term upside remains: Expanding opportunities in data-center AI, high-performance computing, and edge workloads; Zen 6 and ROCm could improve performance and software adoption.
- Optionality with discipline: The upside could come from Zen 6, more commitments from large customers, and a broader software ecosystem, but only if catalysts prove durable.
- Risk-managed approach fits the view: A staged exposure helps participate in upside while guarding against overpaying for uncertain near-term catalysts.

## Risks To Watch
- Nvidia leadership in training and potential gaps in AMD’s ability to compensate with inference-focused gains.
- Regulatory and China exposure risks that could slow revenue growth or affect margins.
- Execution and timing risks around Zen 6 ramp, pricing pressure, and ROCm adoption.
- Data-center demand cycles, cloud spending variability, and potential softness in consumer PCs.
- Valuation sensitivity to uncertain catalysts and multi-quarter demand signals.
