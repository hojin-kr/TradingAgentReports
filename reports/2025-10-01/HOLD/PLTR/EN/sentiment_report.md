I attempted to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for PLTR for 2025-09-25 through 2025-10-01, but the Reddit-data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like the data-fetching tool is currently unavailable or misconfigured on my end.

Here are your best options to move forward, and what I can deliver right now:

Option A: Retry and deliver the full Reddit sentiment report (recommended)
- I will re-run the Reddit data queries for PLTR across the seven dates as soon as the tool is accessible again.
- Deliverable: a comprehensive long-form report with:
  - Daily sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative) for each date
  - Key themes and talking points driving sentiment (e.g., product launches, partnerships, earnings, regulatory news)
  - Notable Reddit post spikes (volume and sentiment drivers)
  - A synthesis of how sentiment aligns with any recent company news or catalysts
  - Trader-focused insights (risk signals, potential entry/exit windows, and scenarios)
  - A final MakrMarkdown table summarizing the key points, catalysts, and sentiment trend per day

Option B: Proceed with an interim qualitative analysis using non-Reddit sources
- If you’d like something now, I can provide a structured qualitative overview of PLTR sentiment and news from available sources other than Reddit (e.g., major news outlets, press releases, public statements, general social chatter) for the past week.
- Deliverable: a concise but insightful report with:
  - High-level sentiment direction (positive/negative/mixed) andPotential themes
  - Recent catalysts (news events, partnerships, product updates, earnings if applicable)
  - Trader-focused takeaways and risk considerations
  - A MakrMarkdown table summarizing sources and themes

Which path would you prefer? If you want Option A, I’ll retry immediately and proceed as soon as the tool is functioning again. If you want Option B now, I’ll pull together a thorough qualitative overview with sources and actionable takeaways.
