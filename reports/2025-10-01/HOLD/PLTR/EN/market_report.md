I attempted to fetch PLTR data from Yahoo Finance to generate the indicator reports, but the data retrieval failed due to a FileNotFoundError in the tool environment. I don’t currently have the CSV data needed to compute and display the indicator values. I can proceed in two ways:

- Option A: Retry data fetch now (or after a brief wait) to generate the full indicator report with live values.
- Option B: Proceed with a structured indicator framework and interpretation guidance using the planned indicators, even if I can’t show numeric outputs yet. I’ll clearly note that the exact values are pending until the data fetch succeeds.

Below I outline a robust, complementary indicator setup for PLTR (Palantir) and how to interpret them once the data becomes available. This selection emphasizes trend, momentum, and volatility—appropriate for a volatile, news-driven name like PLTR.

Chosen indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark; useful for confirming primary regime (bullish/bearish) and potential golden/death cross signals.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures quick momentum shifts; can provide timely entry/exit signals when used with longer averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum indicator showing the difference between two EMAs; signals trend changes via crossovers and convergence/divergence.
- macds: MACD Signal. The EMA of MACD; crossovers with MACD line trigger potential entries/exits; helps reduce false positives.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Visualizes momentum strength; positive/negative bars indicate bullish/bearish momentum; divergences can precede reversals.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator highlighting overbought/oversold conditions; useful for spotting potential reversals, especially when combined with trend context.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility; helps in risk management, setting stop distances, and sizing positions relative to current volatility.

Why these are suitable for PLTR at this time
- PLTR has shown meaningful volatility and trend shifts around earnings, government/tech funding news, and demand cycles for data products. This set covers:
  - Trend framing (50/200 SMA, 10 EMA) to distinguish between sustained uptrends and recoveries versus consolidations.
  - Momentum confirmation (MACD components, RSI) to validate strength behind moves.
  - Volatility management (ATR) to size risk and anticipate widening/narrowing ranges.
- The trio of MACD components (MACD, MACD Signal, MACD Histogram) gives a fuller view of momentum dynamics, which is valuable in a stock that can swing on catalysts.
- RSI adds a momentum perspective that complements trend signals, helping to identify potential pullbacks within an uptrend or rallies within a downtrend, especially if cross-checked with SMA trends.
- ATR provides a practical risk-management lens in a name known for outsized moves.

How to interpret signals once data is available
- Confirming uptrend:
  - Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA; 50SMA above 200SMA (golden cross scenario over time).
  - MACD line above MACD Signal and rising; MACD Histogram positive and expanding.
  - RSI staying above 50 (not in overbought extreme) supports sustained momentum.
  - ATR rising modestly supports increasing volatility with a trend, suggesting room for continued moves (useful for stop placement).
- Reversals or pullbacks in an uptrend:
  - Price tests or crosses below 50SMA or 200SMA; check if 50SMA crosses below 200SMA (bearish cross) for potential trend change.
  - MACD line crossing below MACD Signal; MACD Histogram turning negative.
  - RSI failing to hold above 50 or dropping toward 40–50; look for bullish divergence as a potential setup if price is making higher lows while RSI makes lower lows.
  - ATR expansion during pullbacks can indicate a temporary spike in volatility; use for cautious positioning or wider stops.
- Breakouts/volatile moves:
  - Price moving above upper price channels formed by the combination of SMAs with expanding MACD Histogram; RSI around 60–70 range but not overbought on the first extension could indicate a genuine breakout.
  - ATR rising significantly suggests larger-than-usual range expansion; manage risk with wider stops but confirm with MACD and RSI for direction.
- Confluence helps reduce false signals:
  - For a long entry, look for price above 50SMA/200SMA, MACD bullish crossover, RSI above 50 but below 70, and a rising ATR indicating fresh momentum.
  - For a short or fading rally, look for price below the SMAs, MACD turning bearish, RSI slipping toward oversold levels in a downtrend, and ATR rising with negative momentum.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching PLTR data now to produce the exact indicator values and generate a full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators. If you’d like me to retry, say “retry data fetch,” and I’ll attempt again immediately.
- Alternatively, if you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, scenario-based analysis using the framework above and discuss potential entry/exit rules you could apply today, pending data.

Markdown table: Key indicators, purpose, and interpretation overview
| Indicator | Purpose | How to interpret for PLTR (in short) |
|-----------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price above 50SMA = bullish medium-term context; price below = bearish context. |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend benchmark | Price above 200SMA suggests long-term uptrend; crossing 200SMA is notable for trend-confirmation. |
| close_10_ema | Quick momentum shifts | Price above/below 10EMA signals near-term momentum; use with longer SMAs for confirmation. |
| macd | Momentum/change of trend | MACD line above MACD Signal and rising = bullish momentum; below/suppressing = bearish momentum. |
| macds | MACD signal line | Crosses with MACD as a trigger; helps filter MACD cross signals for entries/exits. |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Positive histogram = strengthening bullish momentum; negative = weakening/bearing momentum; divergences matter. |
| rsi | Momentum strength and overbought/oversold | RSI >50 suggests upside momentum; RSI <50 suggests downside momentum; watch for reversals/divergences. |
| atr | Volatility level and position sizing framework | Rising ATR indicates higher volatility and may warrant wider stops or positioned sizing adjustments. |

If you want me to proceed with Option A (retry data fetch now) or Option B (continue with the qualitative framework and prepare concrete setup/alerts once data is fetched), please tell me which you prefer.
