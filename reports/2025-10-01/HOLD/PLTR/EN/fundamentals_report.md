I attempted to fetch the PLTR fundamental data (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement) as of 2025-10-01, but the data-retrieval tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError. This looks like an internal data-access issue right now. I can either retry the data pulls immediately or proceed with a qualitative/structural analysis in the meantime and update you as soon as the data tools come back online.

What I can deliver once the data tools respond (or if you approve a delay):
- A comprehensive fundamental report for PLTR (Palantir Technologies), covering:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Recent corporate events and strategic shifts (last few quarters)
  - Quarterly income statement: revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS, yoy/qoq trends
  - Balance sheet: cash, debt, total assets/liabilities, working capital, liquidity ratios
  - Cash flow statement: operating cash flow, investing, financing, free cash flow
  - Key profitability and efficiency metrics: gross margin, operating margin, net margin, R&D/SG&A intensity, ROA/ROE (if applicable)
  - Capital structure and liquidity: debt levels, liquidity position, cash burn or cash build
  - Insider sentiment (past 15 days) and insider transactions (past 15 days)
  - Growth drivers and risks: customer concentration, mix of government vs commercial revenue, bookings/backlog trends, contract renewals, and exposure to procurement cycles
  - Market context and actionable takeaways for traders: catalysts, potential risks, and scenario analysis
  - A concise, trader-focused conclusion with potential entry/exit considerations under different scenarios
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points (to copy into reports)

If you’d like me to proceed now with a best-effort qualitative assessment (without the latest tool data), I can provide:
- A current-state overview of PLTR’s fundamentals based on widely known public factors up to 2024-2025
- Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT)
- Potential catalysts and risks relevant to traders
- A ready-to-fill Markdown table you can use while we wait for the data tools to come back

Please tell me which option you prefer:
1) Retry data retrieval now and then deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as the tools succeed
2) Start with a qualitative PLTR fundamentals overview (no tool data), followed by the data-backed report once tools are available

If you want me to retry immediately, I’ll kick off the data pulls again.
