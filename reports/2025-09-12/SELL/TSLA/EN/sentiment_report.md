I’m seeing a backend error when trying to fetch Reddit stock info for TSLA on 2025-09-12 (FileNotFoundError). I’ve retried a few times, but the tool backend is currently unavailable.

Options:
1) I can retry the Reddit data fetch now or every few minutes until it succeeds.
2) I can pivot to a comprehensive qualitative analysis using other sources (e.g., Twitter/X sentiment, major news outlets, company announcements) and deliver a detailed trader-focused report with a markdown table of key points.
3) I can prepare the full long-form report structure now and fill in data as soon as the Reddit tool comes back online.

Please tell me which path you prefer. If you’d like the second option, I’ll:
- Compile daily sentiment from other social sources over the past week for TSLA, with polarity and volume trends.
- Summarize recent Tesla news headlines (product updates, earnings, guidance, regulatory moves, supply-chain news).
- Identify themes driving sentiment (AI/Full Self-Driving, EV demand, margins, competition, regulatory approvals).
- Assess implications for traders across potential scenarios (new product launches, production changes, macro factors).
- End with a detailed bullet list of actionable takeaways and a Markdown table of key points.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data now or proceed with the alternative approach?
