I attempted to fetch TSLA data and the requested indicators, but the data retrieval tools returned a FileNotFoundError. I can retry fetching the data, or proceed with a robust indicator framework and qualitative analysis for TSLA based on typical behavior. Here is a carefully chosen 8-indicator set with rationale and a detailed framework you can use once the data are available.

Selected indicators (8, non-redundant, complementary)
- close_200_sma
- close_50_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Rationale and how these indicators help with TSLA (context: TSLA is a high-volatility, momentum-driven stock influenced by tech/product news, demand cycles, and policy/regulatory news)
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend anchor. Helps confirm the overarching market regime (bullish if price is above 200 SMA, bearish if below). Useful for higher-timeframe bias and for filtering trades in more volatile environments.
- close_50_sma: Mid-term trend signal. When price trades above/below the 50 SMA, it provides a more responsive read on intermediate momentum and potential support/resistance levels. Crossovers with price or with the 200 SMA can indicate trend changes.
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum probe. More sensitive to recent price moves, helping identify early shifts in momentum. Use as a trigger alongside longer-term trend filters to reduce whipsaws.
- macd: Core momentum/shift indicator. MACD line crossovers and histogram direction help identify changes in momentum that may precede price moves. In TSLA’s volatile context, MACD crossovers should be confirmed with other signals.
- macdh: Momentum strength gauge. The MACD histogram shows the pace of momentum changes. Positive histogram growth supports upside strength; negative growth supports downside pressure. Useful to gauge acceleration or deceleration in the trend suggested by MACD.
- rsi: Momentum oscillator with overbought/oversold framing. Helps identify potential reversals or pullbacks when paired with trend signals. Be mindful that in strong uptrends RSI can stay elevated for extended periods; confirm with price trends.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a dynamic mean reversion benchmark. Price movement around the middle band helps assess whether price is normalizing or entering breakout territory. When combined with boll_ub/boll_lb, it can highlight breakout zones or pullbacks toward the mean.
- atr: Volatility gauge for risk management. Higher ATR signals higher price dispersion and wider stop distances. Useful for sizing positions and placing stops, particularly in a stock like TSLA that can experience rapid, news-driven moves.

How to interpret the combination (practical guidance)
- Trend confirmation: If price is above both 200 SMA and 50 SMA, and 10 EMA is above price with MACD positive, the tilt is toward a bullish setup. Watch the MACD histogram (macdh) for momentum acceleration.
- Early momentum shifts: A bullish crossover in macd with a rising macdh, while price remains above the 50/200 SMAs, strengthens a continuation signal and may imply a favorable entry point for a trend trade.
- Caution zones: If RSI prints near/above 70 while price sits near resistance or above the 200 SMA, be wary of a potential pullback or consolidation; confirm with MACD and Bollinger bands (price action around boll and potential squeeze/breakout signals).
- Volatility-aware entries: When ATR is rising, expect wider price swings; use larger stop distances and possibly consider reducing position size or waiting for stronger confluence signals (e.g., MACD/macd confirming direction with RSI backing it up).
- Mean-reversion vs breakout: If price trades toward the boll_ub (upper band) and breaks above, combined with MACD bullish signals, it can indicate a breakout; conversely, price near boll_lb with negative momentum can signal a pullback.
- Volume context (optional note): If TSLA’s price action aligns with a rising ATR and volume-supported moves, the signals become more reliable (not included in the 8 indicators above due to the current cap, but worth monitoring in practice).

Next steps
- I can retry fetching TSLA data and the 8 indicators precisely and generate a detailed, data-driven report with current values and signals as soon as the data tools can access the data again.
- If you prefer, you can provide the data or allow me to retry after a short interval, and I will output a fully numeric, trend-by-trend interpretation with a summarized action plan.

Proposed quick-action checklist when data is available
- Confirm trend bias: price relative to 200 SMA and 50 SMA; check for golden/death cross signals.
- Confirm momentum: MACD cross, MACD histogram direction, and 10 EMA relative to price.
- Check RSI for overbought/oversold context and potential divergences.
- Validate volatility/risk posture: ATR-based stop placement and position sizing.
- Assess breakout/mean-reversion: price relative to Bollinger middle and bands.
- Integrate signals into a compact action plan (e.g., Buy/Hold/Sell threshold with confirmation rules).

Markdown summary table (key points)
| Indicator | Role | What signals to watch | Practical takeaway for TSLA |
|---------|------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend anchor | Price above/below 200 SMA; cross with price or 50 SMA | Use as macro bias; avoid counter-trend entries unless strong confirmation |
| close_50_sma | Mid-term trend | Price relative to 50 SMA; crossovers with price/200 SMA | Bias entries on uptrends if price above 50 SMA and MACD confirms |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Price above/below 10 EMA; alignment with MACD momentum | Use as a trigger point for entries/exits in confirmed trends |
| macd | Momentum/shift | MACD line cross, direction, and histogram (macdh) | Confirm trend pivots; prefer entries when MACD aligns with price trend |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram growth/decline | Gauge strength of move; use for risk-adjusted position sizing |
| rsi | Momentum oscillator | Divergences; overbought/oversold thresholds (70/30) | Watch for reversals or consolidation; avoid over-reliance in strong trends |
| boll | Mean-reversion/volatility benchmark | Price around middle band; breakouts when crossing bands | Identify breakout zones versus mean-reversion setups |
| atr | Volatility/risk management | Higher ATR indicates more volatility and larger stop ranges | Adjust stops and position size to real-time volatility |

If you’d like, I can retry the data fetch now or on a specific time window, then generate a fully data-driven, timestamped TSLA report with precise values and formatted signals.
