Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the Reddit-based stock news for AMD on 2025-09-12, but the Reddit data tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError) and retries have failed. I can’t access Reddit sentiment data for the latest week right now.

Here are options so we can keep moving:

- Retry now or in a short window: I can keep trying the Reddit data fetch and, once it works, deliver the full, detailed report with day-by-day sentiment, themes, and implications for traders.
- Proceed with a best-effort plan: I can draft a comprehensive AMD analysis framework focusing on the likely sentiment drivers (AI/data-center demand, GPU supply/demand, product roadmap, earnings expectations, macro/news catalysts) and outline trader implications, risks, and scenarios. This would be done without the Reddit-specific data until the tool comes back online.
- Use alternative data sources (if you have access to them): If you can provide or authorize other sentiment feeds or news sources, I can incorporate those in parallel.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with a plan and a Markdown-ready report structure (ready to fill in once the Reddit tool is back), I can do that now. Here’s what the final report will cover and how it will be structured:

- Executive snapshot: current sentiment tone, key headlines from the last week, and notable Reddit threads/themes (once data is available).
- Daily sentiment breakdown: positive/neutral/negative shares per day, with top themes (e.g., AI demand, product launches, supply chain, earnings expectations).
- News flow synthesis: summarize AMD-related headlines in the past week (earnings, product news, partnerships, guidance, etc.).
- Sentiment drivers analysis: which topics moved sentiment up or down (AI adoption, gaming demand, datacenter growth, competitive concerns with Nvidia/Intel, supply constraints).
- Risk and catalysts: identify downside/upside catalysts and potential risks (pricing pressure, capex timing, AI cycle shifts, macro factors).
- Trader implications: actionable takeaways and trade ideas under base/bull/bear scenarios.
- Key metrics to watch next week: earnings guidance cues, product cycle updates, infrastructure and AI demand indicators.
- Appendix: raw sentiment signals, notable quotes, and a concise sentiment heatmap.

If you want me to proceed now with the plan above (without the live Reddit input until the tool is fixed), please confirm and I’ll generate the framework immediately. Otherwise, I can keep retrying the Reddit fetch and deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as it’s available.
