# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD offers a multi-year data-center and AI platform with a software ecosystem. Buy with a disciplined, risk-managed approach to capture upside if data-center growth and ROCm monetization prove durable.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Buy. Confidence level: Medium-High.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Durable growth opportunity: A combined data-center platform (CPU, GPU, AI accelerators) plus a software ecosystem can gain share beyond current expectations.
- Software moat and margins: ROCm creates switching costs and opens recurring software revenue, supporting margins as data-center mix grows.
- Roadmap and optionality: A sustained product cadence and broader cloud deployments imply ongoing demand and potential for higher pricing over time.
- Diversified revenue base: Hardware plus software services and embedded/semi-custom segments reduce reliance on a single line.
- Margin upside potential: As data-center sales rise and software monetization matures, overall profitability can improve even if hardware prices face pressure.
- Execution resilience: A multi-stream approach (hardware, software, services) provides ballast during cycles.
- Multi-year view: The strongest case rests on a durable, platform-driven upside rather than a quick, one-quarter move.

## Risks To Watch
- Demand durability and cycles: AI spend may be episodic or concentrated with a few large customers.
- Margin pressure: Competition and high, washy pricing cycles could compress gross margins.
- ROCm monetization risk: Enterprise uptake of software may lag hardware growth.
- Cadence and execution: Delays or weaker performance in new products could hurt credibility.
- Macro/regulatory: China exposure and export controls could affect mix, pricing power, and growth.
