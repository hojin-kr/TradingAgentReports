Data retrieval issue
- I attempted to fetch data and run the selected indicators for AMD, but the data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. This means I currently don’t have the actual price data or indicator outputs to quote precise values from 2024-09-12 to 2025-09-12.
- Plan: I’ll re-run the data fetch as soon as the data source is accessible or after the environment issue is resolved. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a robust, complementary indicator set and a detailed framework for interpreting the results once you have the data.

Selected indicators (8 indicators, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- close_10_ema
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll

Rationale for the chosen set
- Trend and dynamic support/resistance (close_50_sma, close_200_sma): These give medium- and long-term trend context and can highlight major support/resistance zones. The 200-SMA helps confirm the broader trend (golden/death cross considerations), while the 50-SMA offers a more responsive trend view and can act as a support/resistance level.
- Momentum signals (macd, macds, macdh, rsi): The MACD family (MACD line, MACD signal, MACD histogram) provides insight into momentum changes and potential trend reversals. RSI offers a momentum check to assess overbought/oversold conditions and potential divergences, useful when price is near key levels or rotating between support/resistance.
- Volatility/MA context (boll): Bollinger Middle (20-SMA basis) and its relationship to price help identify breakout zones and dynamic ranges. Boll provides an additional lens on how price interacts with a vol-based channel, which can be especially informative around earnings or product-cycle news when volatility typically spikes.

How to read signals once data is available (high-level guidance)
- Trend context
  - Price above 200-SMA → long-term bullish context; look for pullbacks toward 50-SMA or 200-SMA as potential entries on confluence with bullish MACD/rsi patterns.
  - Price below 200-SMA → caution; assess if a cross below/above 50-SMA and MACD momentum supports a reversal or continuation.
- Short- to medium-term momentum (MACD family)
  - MACD line crossing above MACD signal (positive histogram) → bullish momentum; confirm with RSI not in extreme overbought zone.
  - MACD line crossing below MACD signal (negative histogram) → bearish momentum; confirm with RSI not in extreme oversold zone.
  - MACD histogram increasing in positive territory → strengthening bullish momentum; decreasing → weakening momentum.
- RSI read-through
  - RSI > 70 → potential overbought; look for bearish divergences or price turning down from resistance. In uptrends, RSI can stay elevated longer, so corroborate with price action and trend indicators.
  - RSI < 30 → potential oversold; look for bullish reversals, especially if price tests major supports like the 50-SMA or Boll lower band.
  - RSI divergence with price (e.g., price making new highs, RSI not) → potential reversal signal when confirmed by MACD or price action at key levels.
- Volatility and breakout context (boll)
  - Price moving toward or beyond Boll upper band with rising volume → potential breakout or continuation in the uptrend; confirm with MACD/rsi.
  - Price moving toward or beyond Boll lower band with rising volume → potential downside breakout or continuation in the downtrend; confirm with MACD/rsi.
  - Price centered around Boll middle with tight bands → lower volatility; wait for a breakout signal with confluence from trend indicators.
- Confluence rules
  - Favor entries when multiple signals align: e.g., price above 50- and 200-SMA with bullish MACD cross, RSI not overbought, and price near upper Boll band indicating a breakout direction.
  - Be cautious in choppy markets; use ATR for position sizing and risk management (though ATR is not among the eight chosen indicators, it’s a helpful risk tool to consider alongside these indicators).

Risk considerations and context for AMD
- AMD often moves on product cycle news, roadmap updates, and sector-driven tech sentiment. This means breakouts can be fueled by shifts in market expectations and insider/analyst chatter. Use these indicators to gauge trend and momentum, but always couple with earnings/guide dates and sector context.
- In volatile tech periods, RSI can stay extended longer; rely on MACD and price action around key moving averages to avoid false signals.
- Use Boll bands to distinguish between true breakouts and price riding the band in a strong trend; combine with MACD and RSI to filter signals.

Next steps
- I will re-run the data fetch and compute the eight indicators as soon as the data source is accessible. Then I’ll deliver:
  - A detailed, data-backed trend assessment for AMD (2024-09-12 to 2025-09-12).
  - Specific entry/exit considerations based on confluences of the eight indicators.
  - A concise summary and a table of key observations.

Summary table for quick reference (to be filled with actual values once data is available)

If you want, I can proceed to retry the data fetch as soon as the system allows and then provide a fully populated, data-driven analysis with concrete values and a finalized trading interpretation.
