Recommendation: Buy with disciplined risk controls.

Why this aligns with the plan
- Core thesis still centers on AI/cloud leadership from mega-caps, durable cash flows, and a macro backdrop that has shown resilience. A multi-indicator guardrail approach reduces false positives and supports higher-probability entries.
- While macro sensitivity and concentration risks exist, they can be managed with position sizing, hedges, and clear exit rules. The plan’s emphasis on trend confirmation (50SMA/200SMA alignment, MACD, RSI, Bollinger bands, and volume) provides a structured path to entry and risk management.

Specific, actionable execution (current stance)
- Stage 1: Establish core exposure to QQQ equal to 60% of your intended long position (i.e., if your target is 100 shares, start with ~60 shares or equivalent dollar allocation). Use this as the baseline to avoid over-concentration while you observe early momentum.
- Stage 2: Add to the position in 20% increments if:
  - Price closes above the Bollinger upper band and MACD is positive (MACD histogram rising, MACD line above the signal).
  - RSI is rising and stays above 50 but not clearly overbought.
  - Volume on advancing days exceeds recent average and price sits above both 50SMA and ideally 200SMA.
  - If triggered, complete the target exposure over subsequent confirmations, up to your full intended long.

Entry triggers to act on
- Primary trigger: Clean close above Bollinger upper band with positive MACD momentum.
- Confirmation: Increasing volume on up days, RSI > 50 but < 70, price holding above 50SMA (and ideally 200SMA).

Risk controls and hedging
- Position sizing: Keep core exposure within your predefined risk tolerance; avoid over-concentration.
- Hedging: Consider a modest near-term put hedge (e.g., protective puts or a short-term put spread) to defend against macro shocks or a mega-cap miss.
- Stop rules: Implement a trailing or buffer stop. Possible rule: exit the core on a daily/weekly close below the 50SMA for two consecutive closes, or a drop to RSI below 40 with MACD turning negative.
- Upside protection: If volatility spikes and risk appetite shifts, you can scale back exposure or convert a portion to hedged exposure.

Monitoring and review cadence
- Review weekly: eight-indicator posture, macro cues (inflation, rates, AI earnings cadence), and mega-cap guidance.
- Reassessment triggers: material miss by a top constituent, a fresh regulatory/regime risk event, or deterioration in momentum indicators.

Portfolio considerations
- Core exposure: Maintain QQQ as the spine of your growth tilt.
- Diversification: Avoid one-name concentration; balance with diversified mega-cap exposure and an auxiliary sleeve (e.g., value or dividend-oriented) if risk tolerance shifts.
- Plan B: Have a predefined bear-case scenario with exits or hedges ready if macro conditions deteriorate.

Notes on execution discipline
- Don’t fight the trend when macro/fundamentals align; use the eight-indicator guardrails to time entries and avoid premature moves.
- Be transparent about data gaps; rely on the established technical framework and macro signals rather than overfitting to incomplete data.
