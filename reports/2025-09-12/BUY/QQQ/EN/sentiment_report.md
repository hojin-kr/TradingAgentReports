Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the Reddit stock info for QQQ on 2025-09-12, but I’m hitting an internal tool error:

Error: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

What I can do next:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (or at your convenience), in case the backend hiccup is temporary.
- If the tool remains unavailable, switch to a qualitative, data-light analysis using other public signals (news sentiment, macro context, ETF composition) and clearly mark it as a temporarily data-limited view.

Proposed plan if the Reddit tool comes back healthy:
- Compile a comprehensive week-long sentiment and social-momentum report for QQQ (the Nasdaq-100 ETF) using Reddit and other social channels.
- Break down daily sentiment, top discussion topics, notable posts, and any sentiment-shifts around macro events or tech earnings.
- Cross-reference with recent news headlines (tech sector, Fed commentary, macro data) to identify catalysts.
- Translate into actionable takeaways for traders (short-term signals, risk flags, and positioning ideas).

If you’d like me to proceed right away with a workaround (no Reddit data for now), I can:
- Provide a structured qualitative snapshot focusing on: ETF-level sentiment (thematic drivers like tech growth, AI hype, macro risk), recent news headlines affecting QQQ, and the implications for traders.
- Outline a detailed framework for a full long report, and I’ll fill in the data as soon as the Reddit tool is available again.

Would you prefer I:
A) Retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
B) Deliver a qualitative interim snapshot and a framework for the full report until the tool is back?

Notes on QQQ to inform the interim view (for context, still data-light):
- QQQ tracks the Nasdaq-100, so sentiment tends to hinge on large-cap tech and growth names. Broad tech momentum, AI-related narratives, and mega-cap earnings tend to drive both price and social chatter.
- ETF dynamics: exposure concentration, sector weights (technology-heavy), and sensitivity to interest-rate expectations and macro risk appetite.
- Trader takeaways: watch for headline-driven risk-on/risk-off swings, potential dispersion in tech mega-caps vs. smaller techs, and how AI/AI-capital narratives evolve in social discourse.

If you want me to proceed with the interim qualitative snapshot now, I’ll proceed and clearly label it as data-light until the Reddit data tool is available again.
