I attempted to fetch the data, but I’m hitting tool errors right now:

- The parallel tool call for SimFin balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement (and Finnhub insider sentiment/transactions) returned FileNotFoundError.
- When I tried a single call just for the balance sheet, it again failed with the same error.

Two important context notes:

- SPY is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, an ETF, not a single company. The SimFin/FinHub data in these tools is designed around company-level financials and insider activity. ETFs don’t have quarterly balance sheets/income statements in the same sense, and insider sentiment/transactions typically apply to individual issuers, not ETFs.
- Because of the tooling error and the ticker’s ETF nature, I can’t generate the requested company-fundamental report for SPY using the same data sources you asked (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, insider sentiment/transactions).

What I can do next (please pick one or provide guidance):

Option A: Analyze a specific company ticker
- Provide a detailed fundamental report (financial statements, recent history, insider sentiment, insider transactions) for a real company ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, SPGI, etc.).
- I’ll fetch quarterly data from SimFin (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) and insider sentiment/transactions from Finnhub, then deliver a comprehensive, trader-focused interpretation with fine-grained insights and a final Markdown table of key points.

Option B: ETF-level overview for SPY (qualitative plan)
- Since SPY isn’t covered by the same financial statements, I can pivot to an ETF-level fundamental/quality overview, focusing on:
  - Fund-level metrics: asset base (AUM), expense ratio, liquidity, tracking error.
  - Holdings/top constituents (typical SPY exposure to the S&P 500, sector/industry distribution).
  - Historical performance context, correlation to the S&P 500, and risk factors.
  - Concentration and diversification considerations, and potential red flags for traders.
- To deliver this, I’ll need to pull data from appropriate ETF-focussed sources (prospectus, fund fact sheets, ETF data providers). If you’re okay with that, I’ll compile a thorough SPY ETF report with caveats about data sources and any assumptions.

Option C: Switch to a different ticker we can fetch reliably
- Provide a full, data-backed report for another company ticker that’s supported by the existing toolset.

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want Option A (a company), please provide a ticker. If you want Option B (SPY ETF overview), I’ll proceed with an ETF-focused report and clearly note data sources and any limitations.
