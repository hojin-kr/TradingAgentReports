I tried to fetch SPY data, but I hit a FileNotFoundError from the data fetch tool. It looks like the environment is missing the SPY CSV file it expects, so I can’t generate the indicators right now. I can:
- Retry fetching the data now, or
- Try again later, or
- Proceed with a qualitative framework and outline what I’ll deliver once the data is available.

If you’d like me to proceed with the data-driven analysis as soon as the fetch works, here are the 8 indicators I’ll use (non-redundant, complementary, and suitable for SPY’s typical market context):

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma: 50-period simple moving average. Trend direction and dynamic support/resistance; useful for mid-term trend context.
- close_200_sma: 200-period simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark and potential golden/death-cross context; helps with strategic alignment.
- close_10_ema: 10-period exponential moving average. Responsive signal of short-term momentum shifts; good for timely entries when used with longer averages.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum and trend-change signals via crossovers; helps identify shifts in regime.
- macdh: MACD Histogram. Momentum strength and divergence insights; complements macd for gauging acceleration/decay.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals; good for divergence checks with trend.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA). Dynamic baseline for price movement; helps spot breakout or reversion zones when paired with bands.
- vwma: VWMA. Volume-weighted trend confirmation; integrates price action with volume for more robust trend signals.

What I’ll deliver after I fetch the data
- A detailed, nuanced report uncovering fine-grained trends (not just “mixed” or “up/down”).
- analysis of how the SPY price interacts with each indicator (e.g., price respects 50/200 SMA, MACD cross signals, RSI divergences, Bollinger-based breakout zones, and VWMA-validated volume trends).
- an actionable conclusion with trading insights (entry/exit considerations and risk context) tailored to SPY’s current condition.
- a Markdown table at the end summarizing key points, signals, and potential setups.

Next step options
- Option A: I retry the data fetch now and then generate the full report with the 8 indicators.
- Option B: You tell me to proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis in absence of live data (less precise, but I can outline framework and hypothetical scenarios).
- Option C: You provide a date range or lighter set of indicators I should attempt to fetch first.

Would you like me to retry fetching SPY data now? If yes, I’ll run the fetch again and proceed to generate the full indicator-based report once the data is available.
