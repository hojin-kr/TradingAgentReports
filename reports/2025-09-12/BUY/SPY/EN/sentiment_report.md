Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch SPY Reddit data for 2025-09-12, but I ran into a tool error (FileNotFoundError). I can Retry the data pull when the tool is available again, but in the meantime I can provide a plan and an interim qualitative synthesis to keep moving forward.

What I can do now (plan)
- Re-run the Reddit stock info fetch for SPY for 2025-09-12 and nearby dates (past week) as soon as the tool is functioning.
- Supplement with other sources ( StockTwits/X/Twitter sentiment threads, major news headlines from Reuters/Bloomberg/CNBC) to build a daily sentiment map.
- Produce a trader-focused synthesis: daily sentiment delta, prevailing themes, and how those align with SPY price action, with attention to macro drivers (rates, inflation, earnings backdrop) since SPY is a broad market proxy.
- Deliver a final long-form report with:
  - Sentiment arc (by day) and top topics
  - Key news catalysts from the past week
  - Implications for SPY price action and potential levels to watch
  - Risks to consider for traders (macro shifts, policy surprises, macro regime changes)
  - A Markdown table at the end organizing the key points for quick reference

Interim qualitative guidance (no data yet)
- What tends to drive SPY sentiment week-to-week:
  - Macro regime: expectations for interest rates and inflation, especially if there are surprises in CPI/PPI, and ongoing Fed tone.
  - Earnings backdrop: broad-market names driving the index—tech leadership vs. rotation into value/cyclicals.
  - Geo-political and policy news: trade developments, regulatory updates, or geopolitical risk shifts.
  - Flow dynamics: ETF-related factors like fund rebalancing, options activity (gamma squeezes, skew), and liquidity conditions.
- What social sentiment typically reveals for SPY:
  - Positive sentiment often correlates with “risk-on” appetite, strength in mega-cap tech and defensives, and optimism about earnings and growth.
  - Negative sentiment often shows up with concerns about growth slowdown, rate surprises, or macro risk off scenarios.
  - Neutral/tilted sentiment can occur around consolidations, choppier price action, or periods of data drip-feed where traders wait for clearer signals.

Proposed Markdown table (to be filled with actual data once available)
- I will append this table in the final report, but here’s the structure I’ll populate:

Markdown table (structure)
- Date | Daily Sentiment (Bullish / Bearish / Neutral) | Top Topics / Themes | Notable News Headlines | Implications for SPY | Data Source (Reddit / StockTwits / News)

If you’d like, I can proceed with a qualitative synthesis now (focused on SPY as a market proxy) and populate the table with placeholders until the tool data is back. Alternatively, I can wait and retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool issue is resolved. How would you like to proceed?
