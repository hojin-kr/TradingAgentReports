I’m running into a system issue fetching the data from the integrated tools right now (all requested data sources return a FileNotFoundError). I can’t pull insider sentiment, insider transactions, or the SimFin financial statements for AAPL at this moment. Here are options and what I can do next:

What I can do right now
- Provide a detailed methodology and a framework for a comprehensive fundamentals report once data is available.
- Prepare a structured outline with placeholders and guidance on how to interpret each section for traders.
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval in a few minutes or as soon as the data tools are back online.

What I propose you receiving now
- A complete, ready-to-fill report template outlining every key area you’d want to evaluate for AAPL (company profile, basic financials, history, insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, income statement, cash flow) plus explicit criteria for trading insights.
- A clear note on data gaps and the specific data points to watch once data becomes available, so you can plug in numbers quickly.

Proposed structure of the comprehensive report (to be filled with actual data when tools are back)
- Company profile
  - Ticker, exchange, sector/industry, business lines, major products/services, recent strategic shifts.
- Basic financials (overview)
  - Revenue and revenue growth trends (quarterly and Y/Y).
  - Gross margin, operating margin, net margin.
  - Earnings per share (GAAP and non-GAAP if applicable), and key drivers.
  - Return metrics (ROE, ROA, ROIC) and capital allocation highlights (buybacks, dividends, debt management).
- Financial history (trends and context)
  - Revenue and earnings trajectory over the past 4–8 quarters/years.
  - Margin evolution, cost structure changes, R&D intensity, and any one-time items.
- Balance sheet highlights
  - Cash and equivalents, debt levels, liquidity ratios (current ratio, quick ratio), working capital trends.
  - Asset composition (cash, marketable securities, receivables, inventories, PPE) and any notable changes.
- Cash flow highlights
  - Cash flow from operations, investing, and financing.
  - Free cash flow generation and CAPEX intensity.
- Income statement details
  - Breakdown of revenue by major product/service lines and regions (if available).
  - Gross profit per segment, operating expenses trends, and non-operating items.
- Insider sentiment (qualitative framework)
  - What the last 30 days of insider sentiment would indicate (net positive/negative, notable director buys/sells, any unusual insider activity).
  - Contextual interpretation for a trader (reliability, potential signaling, risks of over-interpretation).
- Insider transactions (qualitative framework)
  - Summary of any insider purchases/sales in the period, size relative to holdings, potential motivations (dividend timing, tax considerations, liquidity events).
  - Flags to watch (recurrent purchases by insiders vs. a single anomaly, options exercise patterns).
- Key takeaways for traders (detailed, actionable)
  - What the data would imply for valuation, catalysts, and risk factors.
  - Scenarios and sensitivity analysis ideas (e.g., how margins would need to change to support a given multiple).
- Appendix
  - Definitions of terms, data sources, and note on data refresh cadence.

Request to proceed
- Would you like me to retry data retrieval now, or would you prefer I provide you with the qualitative best-effort outline above and then fill in the numbers as soon as the tools are available?
- If you want a rapid qualitative interpretation in the meantime (without the latest insider data and quarterly figures), I can craft a narrative based on widely known fundamentals and typical Apple (AAPL) fundamentals up to 2024, clearly labeled as not containing the latest 2025-09-12 data.

Data-retrieval status table (for quick reference)

- Insider Transactions: Unavailable due to data tool error
- Balance Sheet (SimFin): Unavailable due to data tool error
- Cash Flow (SimFin): Unavailable due to data tool error

Would you like me to retry now, or should I proceed with the qualitative outline and then insert data as soon as the tools come back online?
