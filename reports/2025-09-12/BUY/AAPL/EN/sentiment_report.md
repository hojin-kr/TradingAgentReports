I tried to fetch Reddit-based sentiment data for AAPL on 2025-09-12, but the tool returned a backend error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry immediately, or switch to a broader qualitative analysis if you’d like. In the meantime, here’s a comprehensive framework and ready-to-fill long-form report you can use once the data fetch succeeds. This will help keep us moving regardless of the temporary data-access hiccup.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A detailed, trader-focused report analyzing social media posts (especially Reddit) and public sentiment over the past week for AAPL.
- A daily sentiment breakdown, topic clustering (product news, services, supply chain, regulatory, earnings guidance, AI/tech adoption, etc.), and notable posts.
- A synthesis of recent company news and how it interacts with social sentiment.
- Concrete implications for traders: catalysts, risks, sentiment-driven mispricings, and potential trading ideas.
- A clear, readable Markdown table at the end summarizing key points.

Proposed structure of the final long report
1) Executive snapshot
- One-page summary of sentiment trajectory, key catalysts over the past week (as identified in posts and news), and implications for AAPL’s near-term risk/reward.

2) Social sentiment overview (last 7 days)
- Daily sentiment scores (bullish, bearish, neutral) and volume.
- Peak sentiment days and notable movements.
- Overall directional bias and any divergence from price action.

3) Topic-level sentiment breakdown
- Major themes driving chatter (e.g., new product announcements, services ecosystem, earnings outlook, hardware durability, supply chain, pricing/retail strategy, AI features, regulatory/regulatory scrutiny).
- Sentiment by theme and any sentiment spillovers between themes.

4) influential sources and posts
- Which subreddits or threads are driving discussion (e.g., r/investing, r/stocks, r/apple, etc.), and the level of influence (upvotes, engagement).
- Representative posts (paraphrased) showing typical narratives (bullish vs bearish).

5) Company news roundup (past 7 days)
- Summarize headlines, outcomes, and any strategic implications (product launches, partnerships, legal/regulatory moves, financial guidance).
- How news aligns or conflicts with Reddit sentiment.

6) Sentiment vs fundamentals context
- How sentiment aligns with or diverges from fundamentals (consensus earnings, revenue growth, product cycle expectations, 5G/AI adoption, Services growth).

7) Risk factors and caveats
- Data limitations (sampling bias, post authenticity, bot activity, geographic skew), and how those affect interpretation.
- Potential reversal catalysts if sentiment becomes excessively bullish or bearish.

8) Trading implications and ideas
- Short-term catalysts to watch (earnings timing, product refresh cycles, regulatory updates).
- Possible trades under different sentiment scenarios (e.g., sentiment peaks vs price pullbacks, hedging strategies).
- Risk controls (position sizing, stop placement, order types in volatile sentiment windows).

9) Summary of key takeaways
- Quick bullet points for rummaging through the day’s decision-making.

10) Appendices (if needed)
- Data sources, methodology, and any caveats.

Ready-to-fill Markdown table (structure to copy into the final report)
- This table captures the key points you’ll want at-a-glance. Replace placeholders with the actual numbers/data once the Reddit sentiment data is available.

Next steps
- Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now? If you prefer, I can proceed with a qualitative, non-data-driven analysis in parallel and begin drafting the report structure around general sentiment trends, while we wait for the Reddit feed to come back.
- If you’re okay with it, I can also run a quick placeholder placeholder analysis using public news headlines and typical sentiment directions for Apple to keep the momentum going and produce a draft report you can refine once the Reddit data arrives.

Please tell me:
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch right away?
- Or should I proceed with the qualitative analysis and draft the report with the framework above, awaiting the Reddit data to populate the numbers?
