I tried to fetch the AAPL data, but the data service returned a FileNotFoundError (internal backend issue). I can retry shortly or proceed with a data-ready framework you can trust once the data load succeeds. In the meantime, here is a robust, complementary 8-indicator framework tailored for AAPL (covering trend, momentum, and volatility) plus a plan for a detailed trend report once data is available.

Recommended 8 indicators (diverse and non-redundant)
1) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance level.
- How to use: Compare price action to the 50SMA; look for price staying above/below for trend confirmation; use as a baseline filter when entering trades.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Apple often exhibits sustained moves that align with mid-term trends; the 50SMA helps filter noise and provides a natural retracement level.

2) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells: Long-term trend context; macro regime.
- How to use: Price above 200SMA signals a longer-term bullish regime; watch for golden cross with shorter averages as a potential longer-term buy signal; vice versa for bearish regime.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Apple’s major secular moves are often guided by long-term trend shifts; the 200SMA acts as a key support/resistance and trend filter.

3) close_10_ema
- Category: Moving Averages
- What it tells: Short-term momentum shifts.
- How to use: Price/structure around the 10EMA helps identify quick shifts; use as a trigger when combined with longer-term filters to avoid whipsaws.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Apple can exhibit rapid intraday/short-span momentum moves around earnings or product-cycle events; 10EMA helps catch these moves early.

4) macd
- Category: MACD Related
- What it tells: Momentum and trend change via differences of EMAs.
- How to use: Monitor MACD line crossing the MACD signal, and look for centerline crossovers; confirm with histogram strength.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: MACD is useful across multiple cycles (earnings, product launches) to flag when momentum is accelerating or waning.

5) macds
- Category: MACD Related
- What it tells: Smoothing of the MACD line; signals via crossovers.
- How to use: Trigger or validate entries when MACD crosses its signal line; combine with price action and other filters to reduce false signals.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Helps refine entries in a stock with frequent volatility around fundamentals; adds a second layer to momentum confirmation.

6) macdh
- Category: MACD Related
- What it tells: Momentum strength through the histogram; divergence hints.
- How to use: Positive/expanding histogram indicates strengthening bullish momentum; negative/expanding indicates worsening momentum; watch for divergences with price.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Divergences can foreshadow reversals around earnings or major news, adding early warning signals.

7) rsi
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- What it tells: Relative strength and potential overbought/oversold conditions.
- How to use: Common thresholds: >70 overbought, <30 oversold; monitor for divergences with price to anticipate reversals; use in conjunction with trend context.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: RSI helps identify pullbacks within uptrends or potential reversals after strong moves, which Apple often experiences around catalysts.

8) atr
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- What it tells: Market volatility and dispersion; helps in risk management.
- How to use: Use ATR to set dynamic stop losses and position sizing; rising ATR suggests wider stops and greater risk; incorporate into risk controls.
- Why it’s relevant for AAPL: Apple often experiences volatility spikes around earnings and product announcements; ATR provides a framework to adjust risk accordingly.

Notes on usage and synergy
- Combined view: Use 50SMA/200SMA to establish the macro trend, confirm with price direction relative to the 10EMA for near-term momentum, and validate with MACD family signals (macd, macds, macdh). Use RSI to spot momentum extremes and potential reversals within the established trend. Use ATR to calibrate risk management around earnings and catalysts.
- Avoid redundancy: Do not rely on RSI and stochastic RSI simultaneously; here we’re using RSI, MACD family, and MA/price action for a balanced view.
- Market context for AAPL (2023-09 to 2025-09): In a broad sense, Apple experienced multi-timeframe moves with strong earnings-driven swings and growth expectations. The above set emphasizes trend confirmation (MA), momentum (MACD family, RSI), and risk (ATR) to navigate such cycles without overfitting to any single indicator’s behavior.

What I can deliver once data is available
- A detailed, data-driven trends report covering multiple timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly) with:
  - Current trend alignment across price vs 50SMA and 200SMA
  - Momentum confirmation through MACD components and RSI divergences
  - Volatility/wrisk assessment via ATR
  - Practical entry/exit ideas with scenario-based guidance (e.g., breakouts above/below moving averages, momentum crossovers, RSI divergence signals)
  - A concise set of trade ideas with risk controls and stop placement recommendations

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now or on your request. If you’d like, I’ll automatically retry until it succeeds and then generate a full data-driven report using these indicators.
- Alternatively, if you want me to proceed with a purely framework-based analysis now (no data), I can provide a scenario-driven interpretation template and placeholders for numbers to fill once the data loads.

Appendix: Key points table
Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to use | Why relevant for AAPL
- close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA for trend cues; use with other signals for entries | Helps capture Apple’s mid-term trend and define support zones
- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend context | Price above 200SMA signals bullish regime; watch for golden/death cross with shorter MA | Filters strategic direction for longer horizons in Apple
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum shifts | Use as a trigger with longer-term filters; beware noise | Captures quick moves around catalysts in Apple
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend changes (MACD line vs signal) | Crossovers, confirm with price action | Robust momentum signal across earning/catalyst cycles
- macds | MACD Related | MACD signal smoothing | MACD vs signal cross for entries; combine with other filters | Improves signal reliability in volatile Apple moves
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength (histogram) | Watch histogram strength and divergences | Early momentum clues around Apple events
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Momentum magnitude; overbought/oversold | 70/30 thresholds, divergence with price | Helps time entries/exits within Apple’s trend context
- atr | Volatility Indicators | Market volatility for risk management | Use to size positions and set stops | Critical around earnings-driven volatility in Apple

Would you like me to retry the data fetch now and then generate the full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators above? If yes, I’ll run the data retrieval again and, once it succeeds, produce the detailed analysis and the Markdown table of key insights.
