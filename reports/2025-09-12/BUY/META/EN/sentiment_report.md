Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the Reddit stock sentiment data for META for 2025-09-12, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like there’s a backend path/config issue with the tool right now. I can:

- Retry fetching the Reddit data immediately, or
- Proceed with a best-effort analysis using available public news and known sentiment signals (without the Reddit feed), and return a structured, trader-focused report with a placeholder for Reddit data to be filled in once the tool is working.

Please tell me which option you prefer. In the meantime, here’s how I’ll structure the final long report once data is in, and what I’ll look for to help traders:

What the report will cover (once data is available)
- Social media sentiment: daily sentiment trend for META over the past week, with key drivers (product changes, regulatory noise, AI/VR developments, earnings expectations).
- Reddit-focused signal: upvotes, comments, and sentiment tilt (e.g., bullish vs. bearish threads) and notable post themes.
- Public company/news flow: latest headlines, earnings expectations, product launches (e.g., AI features, metaverse initiatives), regulatory/news events, competitor context (e.g., X/Twitter, TikTok implications).
- Sentiment-to-price lens: how sentiment shifts aligned with intraday price moves, volume spikes, and implied volatility changes.
- Risk and catalysts: what upcoming events (earnings, product breakthroughs, policy changes) could swing sentiment and stock price.
- Trade implications: actionable ideas (short-term scalps around sentiment swings, longer-term positioning around regulatory or product-cycle catalysts), with caveats.

Proposed final deliverable format
- A narrative analysis section with granular, date-stamped observations (past 7 days).
- A sentiment appendix: daily sentiment scores (positive/neutral/negative) and notable post themes.
- A news appendix: summarized headlines with potential price impact.
- A trader-focused conclusions and risk flags section.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key data points and takeaways.

If you want me to proceed right away, I can:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now.
- In parallel, pull in any other available signals (high-level news headlines and notable META events from the past week) to craft a provisional report.
- Then, once Reddit data comes back, I’ll integrate it into the full report and update the insights.

Would you like me to retry the Reddit data fetch now, or would you prefer I proceed with a Reddit-free preliminary report and fill in Reddit details when the tool is back up?
