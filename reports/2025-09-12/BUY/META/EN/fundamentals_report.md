I attempted to pull META’s weekly fundamental data using the available tools, but I’m hitting a backend error (FileNotFoundError) from all tool calls. Here’s what happened and how we can move forward.

What happened
- Parallel fetch attempt: get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment, get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions, get_simfin_balance_sheet, get_simfin_cashflow, and get_simfin_income_stmt were launched for META with curr_date 2025-09-12.
- All attempts returned FileNotFoundError: “No such file or directory.” This indicates the data sources or the local data bridge used by these tools isn’t accessible right now.

What this means for the current report
- I cannot provide the latest quarterly balance sheet, cash flow, income statement, or insider sentiment/transactions data for META as of 2025-09-12 from the requested data sources.
- I can still deliver a robust, trader-focused fundamental report once the data comes through, or switch to a qualitative analysis based on publicly known context and any data you provide manually.

Proposed path forward (two options)
Option A: Retry data pull (recommended)
- I can retry the same data pulls now or after a short delay to see if the data bridge comes back online.
- If successful, I’ll compile a full weekly fundamental report with:
  - Company profile and business model
  - Latest income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow (quarterly)
  - Key financial metrics (revenue, operating income, net income, FCF, EBITDA, margins, ROE/ROA, leverage)
  - Trend analysis (historical quarterly/annual comparisons)
  - Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 30 days)
  - Risk factors and catalysts relevant to the week
  - A trader-focused takeaway with potential implications for META stock
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points

Option B: Proceed with a qualitative/contextual analysis now
- I can prepare a comprehensive, trader-focused META fundamental report based on:
  - Public context up to 2024-2025 (business model, monetization, AI initiatives, cost structure, capex on the metaverse/AI infra)
  - General balance sheet, cash flow, and profitability trends commonly observed in META’s reporting cadence (without the exact latest figures)
  - Insider sentiment/transactions: I can note that data isn’t available right now and provide guidance on how to interpret those signals once retrieved
  - Key risks and catalysts likely to matter for META in the near term (ads demand, regulatory environment, competition, AI/VR/AI platform investments, user growth, privacy changes)
- This will be qualitative and framed to aid decision-making, with clear placeholders where exact numbers would go once the data tools are back online.

Please choose an option:
- Option A: I retry the data pulls now and deliver the full, data-backed report as soon as I have the numbers.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative/fundamental report now, clearly marking data gaps and outlining exactly what will be updated once data is retrieved.

If you’d like me to proceed with Option B right away, I’ll produce a detailed META fundamentals briefing (including a trader-oriented analysis and a Markdown summary table with the key points and data status). If you prefer Option A, I’ll run the data fetch again and deliver the full report with actual figures and analyses once the data tools succeed.
