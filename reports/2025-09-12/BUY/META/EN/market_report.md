I attempted to fetch META data and the requested indicator reports, but the data retrieval tools are currently returning a FileNotFoundError in this environment. I can’t provide live readings or trends yet. Here’s what I’ll do and what I can provide in the meantime:

What happened
- Parallel data fetch (YFin data + multiple indicator reports) failed due to a FileNotFoundError.
- A follow-up single fetch for META data also failed for the same reason.
- Because of this, I don’t have the latest price data or indicator values to quote precise trend readings for META as of 2025-09-12.

What I can still offer now
- A carefully designed, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators that are complementary for META’s typical market dynamics (tech sector, growth-oriented, volatile).
- Clear rationale for each indicator’s inclusion.
- How to interpret signals once you have the data.
- A ready-to-use Markdown table summarizing key points.

Recommended indicator set (8 indicators)
- close_50_sma
  - What it measures: 50-day simple moving average; a medium-term trend proxy and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s relevant for META: Captures the mid-term trend in tech equities and helps filter out shorter-term noise.
  - Signal cues: Price above 50SMA suggests a bullish tilt; price crossing above/below can signal trend changes; use with faster indicators for timing.
- close_200_sma
  - What it measures: 200-day simple moving average; long-term trend benchmark.
  - Why it’s relevant for META: Common reference for major trend direction (golden/death cross context, long-term bias).
  - Signal cues: Price above 200SMA indicates long-term uptrend; sustained movement below hints at a bearish regime or consolidation.
- close_10_ema
  - What it measures: 10-day exponential moving average; responsive short-term trend/momentum indicator.
  - Why it’s relevant for META: Helps catch quick momentum shifts in a volatile tech stock.
  - Signal cues: Price crossing above/below 10EMA signals near-term momentum shifts; use with longer SMAs for filtering noise.
- macd
  - What it measures: MACD line representing momentum via EMA differences; impulse of trend changes.
  - Why it’s relevant for META: MACD is widely used to spot momentum shifts in high-volatility tech names.
  - Signal cues: MACD line crossing above MACD signal is bullish; crossing below is bearish; pay attention to the histogram for momentum strength.
- macds
  - What it measures: MACD Signal line (the EMA smoothing of the MACD line).
  - Why it’s relevant: Provides a cross-filter with MACD line to confirm entries/exits.
  - Signal cues: MACD cross above signal reinforces bullish entries; cross below reinforces bearish entries.
- rsi
  - What it measures: Relative Strength Index; momentum gauge over a 0–100 scale.
  - Why it’s relevant: Helps identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals in a high-volatility name like META.
  - Signal cues: RSI > 70 suggests overbought risk (potential pullback); RSI < 30 suggests oversold risk (potential bounce); watch for bullish/bearish divergence with price.
- atr
  - What it measures: Average True Range; volatility level.
  - Why it’s relevant: META can experience sharp moves; ATR informs position sizing and stop placement.
  - Signal cues: Rising ATR signals increasing volatility (adjust stops accordingly); stable ATR suggests choppier conditions where trend-following signals may be less reliable.
- vwma
  - What it measures: Volume-Weighted Moving Average; price action filtered by volume.
  - Why it’s relevant: Confirms trend direction with volume, helpful in judging conviction behind moves in META.
  - Signal cues: Price above VWMA with rising VWMA indicates stronger, volume-supported uptrends; failure to confirm with VWMA can warn of false breakouts.

How to interpret signals once you have the data
- Trend confirmation: Look for alignment across MA indicators (price above 50SMA and 200SMA, and 10EMA above price or above 50SMA) to confirm a bullish context.
- Momentum setup: MACD and MACD Signal crossovers (plus positive MACD histogram) add conviction to trend direction; RSI should generally corroborate the momentum story (e.g., rising RSI with rising prices).
- Reversion risk: If RSI approaches extreme levels (overbought/oversold) while price is still trending, be mindful of potential short-term pullbacks; use ATR to adjust stop loss and position sizing.
- Breakouts vs. false signals: Use VWMA to confirm breakouts with volume; if price breaks a level but VWMA isn’t supportive or volume isn’t rising, treat it as a weaker signal.
- Volatility management: Use ATR to size positions and set stops; rising ATR warrants wider stops, preventing premature exits.
- Long-term bias: Cross-check 50SMA with 200SMA signals (golden cross/bearish implications) to gauge broader trend orientation for META.

Next steps
- I’ll re-attempt data retrieval as soon as the environment is able to fetch from Yahoo Finance and generate the 60-day lookbacks you requested. If you want, I can retry now or at a specified time.
- If you’d prefer moving ahead without live data, I can provide a hypothetical scenario analysis using these indicators, though it won’t reflect current METADATA-specific readings.

Markdown table: Key points at a glance
| Indicator | What it Measures | Why it’s Relevant for META | How to Use / Signal Cues |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day simple moving average | Medium-term trend; dynamic support/resistance | Price above/below 50SMA; cross of price with 50SMA signals trend shifts; use with faster indicators for timing. |
| close_200_sma | 200-day simple moving average | Long-term trend benchmark; trend confirmation | Price above/below 200SMA indicates up/down trend; golden/death cross with other MA adds conviction. |
| close_10_ema | 10-day exponential moving average | Short-term momentum; responsive to shifts | Price above/below 10EMA signals near-term momentum; corroborate with longer MA. |
| macd | MACD line momentum indicator | Momentum-driven trend change signals | MACD line crossing above/below MACD signal; rising histogram strengthens bullish signals. |
| macds | MACD Signal line | Cross-confirmation for entries/exits | MACD crosses with MACD Signal add confidence or warn of false signals. |
| rsi | Relative Strength Index | Overbought/oversold momentum gauge | RSI > 70 oversold risk and potential pullback; RSI < 30 oversold bounce; look for divergences. |
| atr | Average True Range | Volatility and risk management | Rising ATR means higher volatility; adjust stops/position size accordingly. |
| vwma | Volume-Weighted Moving Average | Trend confirmation with volume | Price above VWMA with rising VWMA = conviction in up move; lack of volume may warn of a weak breakout. |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching the data now or set up a plan to fetch and compute the exact values for META as of 2025-09-12. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed (retry now, schedule a retry, or proceed with the qualitative analysis and hypothetical scenarios).
