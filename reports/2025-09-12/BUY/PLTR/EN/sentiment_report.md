I tried to fetch the latest Reddit sentiment for PLTR (dated 2025-09-12), but the Reddit data tool returned an internal error (FileNotFoundError). I can’t access the live Reddit data at the moment. I can either retry shortly or proceed with a structured framework and a draft you can fill in once the data fetch succeeds. Here’s how I’ll proceed and what you’ll get in the final report once the tool is working again.

What I can deliver now (structure and approach)
- Objective: A comprehensive long-form report analyzing social media posts (Reddit) and recent company news for PLTR over the past week, with fine-grained insights useful for traders and investors.
- Data I’ll incorporate once the tool returns: daily sentiment polarity, top themes by day, notable Reddit threads (thread-level sentiment), and any correlation with a recent news/events calendar.
- News coverage: I will integrate any relevant Palantir news from the past week (press releases, regulatory filings, earnings timing, product/contract updates) to explain sentiment shifts.
- Trader-oriented insights: actionable takeaways on possible short-term moves, narrative shifts, risk factors, and hedging considerations.

Proposed deliverables once data is available
- Executive summary: A concise read on whether social sentiment and news are skewing bullish, bearish, or mixed for PLTR in the last week.
- Sentiment deep-dive:
  - Daily sentiment trend (with polarity scores if available)
  - Distribution of sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Top themes driving sentiment (e.g., government contracts, product updates, earnings expectations, valuation discussions)
  - Any notable sentiment spikes and the associated threads or news events
- Newsflow synthesis:
  - Summary of the week’s most material news items and their likely impact on sentiment and price
  - Assessment of whether news supports or contradicts the sentiment narrative
- Implications for traders:
  - Short-term directional bias considerations (if any)
  - Key risk factors and catalysts to watch
  - Suggested considerations for position sizing or hedging around events
- Appendix: Data notes and methodology, including how sentiment is computed and any caveats.

Next steps
- I can retry the Reddit data fetch immediately. If you’d like, I’ll attempt again now and then compile the full report with the actual sentiment metrics and themes as soon as the tool responds successfully.
- If you prefer, I can also proceed with a qualitative framework using other sources (e.g., official news releases, earnings calls, industry news) in parallel, but I’ll clearly label those as non-Reddit signals.

Please let me know:
- Should I retry the Reddit data retrieval now and proceed to generate the full report once it succeeds?
- Or would you like me to proceed with a purely qualitative, news-focused draft for PLTR in the meantime?
