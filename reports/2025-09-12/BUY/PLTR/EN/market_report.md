I attempted to fetch PLTR data and run the requested indicators, but the data retrieval tool returned a FileNotFoundError. I can’t access the PLTR price history or the indicator results in this environment right now. If you can re-run the data fetch or grant access to a live data source, I’ll generate a full, up-to-date report immediately. In the meantime, here’s a detailed plan with a complementary 8-indicator set you can use for PLTR, plus how to interpret them together once data is available.

Recommended indicator set (8 total) with rationale
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  Why: Provides a robust view of the mid-term trend and dynamic support/resistance. Helps filter out noise from shorter cycles.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  Why: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for identifying major trend direction and potential golden/death cross signals when compared with the price and shorter averages.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  Why: Responsive momentum gauge for short-term shifts. Useful to spot quicker entry/exit ideas when used with longer averages as a filter.
- macd: MACD line
  Why: Core momentum indicator. Crosses above/below zero signal trend changes; good for aligning with price action and other indicators.
- macdh: MACD Histogram
  Why: Shows momentum strength and potential divergence more clearly than the MACD line alone. Helps confirm or question MACD cross signals.
- rsi: RSI
  Why: Momentum oscillator that flags overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. Important to watch for divergences, especially in trending markets.
- atr: Average True Range
  Why: Volatility proxy. Helps with position sizing, stop placement, and understanding risk in the current regime; useful to adjust expectations in high/low volatility periods.
- vwma: Volume-Weighted Moving Average
  Why: Confirms price moves with volume. Helps distinguish genuine moves from price moves on light volume; strengthens breakout or fade signals when price moves with rising VWMA.

How to interpret signals in combination (PLTR context)
- Trend confirmation setup:
  - Price above both 50SMA and 200SMA indicates a bullish bias; look for a bullish MACD cross (macd > 0 with rising macdh) and a rising VWMA to confirm volume-backed strength.
  - RSI in the 40s–60s range can support a sustainable move if not diverging negatively; avoid chasing if RSI is overbought (≥70) in an established uptrend without MACD/MACD-H showing continued strength.
- Entry ideas (long) in a bullish backdrop:
  - Price pulls back toward the 10EMA or the area around the 50SMA while MACD histograms remain positive and rising, RSI not overbought, and VWMA confirms the move with rising volume.
- Entry ideas (short) in a bearish backdrop:
  - Price trades below 50SMA and 200SMA; MACD turns negative with a declining histogram; RSI trends lower and not in oversold territory; ATR rising suggests higher volatility but with downside momentum.
- Breakout considerations:
  - A breakout above recent resistance with price breaking above 50SMA and VWMA turning up on higher volume can signal a stronger move; confirm with MACD turning positive and MACD histogram increasing while RSI approaches a non-extreme level.
- Risk management notes:
  - Use ATR to size stops: a multiple of ATR (e.g., 1.0–1.5x ATR) can provide volatility-aware stop distances.
  - If VWMA diverges from price (price moving up while VWMA lags or falls), treat with caution—volume support may be weakening.
- Cautionary cases:
  - In strong uptrends, RSI can stay overbought for extended periods; don’t rely on RSI alone for exits—let MACD, ATR, and trend structure guide decisions.
  - In choppy markets, crossovers in MACD/macd histogram can give false signals; require alignment with price action and volume (VWMA).

Next steps to deliver a full, current report
- Retry data retrieval for PLTR:
  - get_YFin_data(symbol="PLTR", start_date="2024-09-12", end_date="2025-09-12")
  - get_stockstats_indicators_report for indicators: close_50_sma, close_200_sma, close_10_ema, macd, macdh, rsi, atr, vwma with curr_date set to 2025-09-12 and look_back_days 30
- Once data is available, I’ll provide:
  - A fine-grained trend appraisal (short, medium, and long term) for PLTR
  - A signal table listing each indicator’s current reading, interpretation, and combined signal
  - A concise trading plan with entry/exit ideas and risk controls
  - A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points (as requested)

Please let me know if you’d like me to retry data retrieval now or proceed with an alternative data source. If you can re-run the tools or provide access, I’ll generate the complete, up-to-date report with the eight selected indicators and a detailed trend analysis, followed by a tidy Markdown table of key points.
