Summary verdict: Buy NVDA with a disciplined, risk-managed plan. The plan you provided aligns with a long-term, high-conviction view, but I will implement staged entry and hedging to manage volatility and key risks.

Rationale in brief
- Core thesis: NVDA benefits from a multi-year AI infrastructure cycle, a durable CUDA/software moat, and solid cash flow/backlog. This supports earnings power and ongoing capacity for R&D and expansion.
- Risks to monitor: valuation stretch, XPUs competition, policy/export controls, and potential demand cyclicality. Hedging and staged entry are designed to limit downside while preserving upside if the thesis plays out.
- Risk controls enhance the thesis: protective hedges (puts or collars), a disciplined trailing stop, and a staged build to reduce impact from near-term volatility.

Recommended execution plan (practical, risk-managed)
1) Position sizing
- Core exposure: 3–6% of portfolio as a high-conviction core.
- Entry approach: initiate 40–50% of the intended core today. Add a second tranche on a meaningful pullback (roughly 5–10% from current level) or on a clear positive momentum signal (e.g., price trims back to key moving averages with volume pickup).

2) Hedging and risk protection
- Primary hedge option: purchase a protective put with a 6–12 month horizon, strike 5–15% below current price (ATM to slightly OT), to cap downside while maintaining upside.
- Alternative hedge: implement a collar by selling a higher-strike call to offset put cost if you prefer to keep upside participation with lower net hedging expense.
- Stop discipline: apply a trailing stop of 12–20% from the average entry price, adjusted for interim volatility. This helps guard against abrupt regime changes.

3) Catalysts and monitoring
- Key catalysts: quarterly results and backlog updates, licensing progress (especially in non-China regions), Broadcom XPUs developments, and policy headlines affecting export controls.
- Technical/price checks: monitor trend signals around 10/50/200-day moving averages, MACD momentum, RSI behavior, and ATR for volatility context.

4) Adaptation rules
- If policy/regulatory risk escalates or XPUs gain meaningful share, tighten hedges or trim exposure.
- If licensing momentum accelerates and XPUs don’t erode fundamentals, consider scaling into the second tranche on favorable pullbacks.
- Have predefined exit thresholds tied to valuation context or clear erosion of growth signals to avoid bagholding in a high-valuation name.

5) Documentation and review
- Maintain a concise thesis memo with trigger points for re-evaluation and a clear exit path. Review after quarterly results and at major macro/policy headlines.

Bottom line
- Given the bullish thesis and the risk mitigants, the recommended stance is Buy NVDA with a structured risk-management overlay and staged entry. The plan prioritizes participation in the secular AI cycle while acknowledging volatility and regulatory/competitive risks.
