Sorry about that—there was a tool error retrieving Reddit-based stock news for NVDA.

The error (FileNotFoundError) suggests the Reddit data source isn’t accessible right now. I can proceed in a couple of ways:

Option A (preferred): Retry fetching Reddit stock info now and then assemble the full, detailed NVDA sentiment/news report (social media sentiment by day for the past week, plus recent company news) with a Markdown table at the end.

Option B: If the Reddit tool remains unavailable, I’ll proceed with Plan B: compile a comprehensive NVDA sentiment/news analysis using other public sources (official NVDA releases, major news outlets, and general social media signals where available) and clearly note any data gaps.

Please tell me which option you’d like. If you’d like me to retry now, say “Retry.” If you’d prefer Plan B, say “Proceed with Plan B.”

In the meantime, here’s the structure I’ll deliver once data is in:

- Executive snapshot: brief read on NVDA’s current state (market backdrop, recent price action, implied volatility cues if available).
- Social media sentiment (past 7 days):
  - Day-by-day sentiment trend (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Notable themes driving sentiment (AI demand, supply chain, guidance, product cycles, earnings expectations)
  - Key influencers or recurring voices (retail vs. institutional signals, notable posts)
- News heat and events (past 7–10 days):
  - Major product/news milestones (launches, partnerships, regulatory updates)
  - Earnings/Guidance related mentions and market impact
- Market context signals:
  - AI hardware demand narrative, competitor dynamics (e.g., AMD, others), supply chain chatter
  - Macro/regulatory signals that could affect sentiment
- Price-action correlation:
  - How sentiment shifts align with intraday/weekly price moves, volume, and options data (if available)
- Risks and catalysts:
  - Short-term catalysts (events in the next week) and potential sentiment risks
- Investment implications for traders:
  - Short-term trading thesis, risk controls, and scenarios
- Quick-reference table (Markdown) summarizing key points:
  - Theme | Sentiment level | Drivers | Potential trades or hedges

If you want the report to focus on a specific angle (e.g., options market implications, retail sentiment dominance, or a focus on AI data-center demand), tell me and I’ll tailor it.
