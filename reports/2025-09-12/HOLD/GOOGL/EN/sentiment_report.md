Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the latest Reddit stock data for GOOGL (current date 2025-09-12) but I hit an internal tool error (FileNotFoundError). It looks like the Reddit data retrieval tool is unavailable at the moment. I can retry shortly or proceed with a thorough, data-grounded framework using alternative sources if you’d like. In the meantime, here’s how I can proceed and a structured draft you can use once the data tool is back up.

What I can do right now (without the Reddit feed)
- Provide a robust framework for a trader-focused, long-form report on GOOGL (Alphabet) that you can populate with Reddit sentiment data once the tool is functioning.
- Outline the key sentiment signals, categories of news to monitor, and potential implications for traders.
- Deliver a ready-to-fill Markdown table summarizing the core points, so you can drop in the exact sentiment numbers and headlines as soon as the data is available.

Proposed structure of the comprehensive report (to be filled with Reddit sentiment and news data)
1) Executive Summary
- High-level takeaway on sentiment trend over the past week and its potential implications for Alphabet stock (GOOGL).

2) Data and Methodology
- Data sources: Reddit threads and mentions (r/investing, r/stocks, r/technology, r/Google, etc.), plus recent Alphabet-related news.
- Time window: Past 7 days (or your preferred window).
- Sentiment scoring: How positive/negative/neutral signals are aggregated (e.g., post-level sentiment, post engagement, topic tagging).

3) Reddit Sentiment Landscape
- Day-by-day sentiment: Summary of daily sentiment scores and notable shifts.
- Top themes from posts: AI strategy, ad market dynamics, cloud progress, YouTube monetization, regulatory risk, product launches, stock-specific chatter.
- Post volume and engagement trends: Changes in discussion intensity and key influencers.

4) News and Catalyst Review
- Major headlines from the past week (earnings chatter, product updates, regulatory/regulatory risk, antitrust proceedings, leadership comments, stock actions like buybacks/dividends, AI announcements).
- Implications of each headline for fundamentals and sentiment.

5) Sentiment-Driven Risk and Opportunities
- Short-term risk signals (e.g., sentiment spikes on regulatory risk or disappointing AI progress).
- Potential upside catalysts (AI product milestones, cloud growth hitting targets, favorable ad market trends).
- Implications for option strategies, if relevant (expiring near-term IV changes, skew, etc.).

6) Quantitative Sentiment Signals (if data available)
- Daily sentiment index (e.g., -1 to +1)
- Moving averages or momentum over the week
- Concentration of negativity among top subreddits vs. broader threads

7) Trader Takeaways and Scenarios
- Base case and alternative scenarios with probabilistic flavor (bullish, neutral, bearish) given sentiment and news momentum.
- Suggested watchlist triggers (e.g., sentiment crossing a threshold, specific headline categories).

8) Risks and Limitations
- Data reliability caveats for social sentiment.
- Potential for sentiment to diverge from fundamentals over short horizons.

9) Appendix
- Glossary of terms
- Snapshot of key Reddit subreddits to monitor
- List of potential future data points to capture

Draft Markdown table (to be filled with live data)
- Note: This table is a placeholder you can populate once the Reddit data tool is back.

| Section | What to fill (with live data) | Flags / Interpretation Notes |
|---------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 7-day sentiment trend | Day-by-day sentiment scores for GOOGL | Positive trend indicates growing optimism; negative trend may precede pullbacks |
| Top themes from Reddit | AI strategy, ad market, cloud, YouTube, regulatory risk | Track which themes dominate and shift over time |
| Post volume / engagement | Daily count of posts and avg engagement | Spikes can indicate strong interest or event-driven chatter |
| Notable posts/headlines | 2–5 most upvoted posts per day | Identify recurring narratives or misinformation risk |
| News headlines (past 7 days) | List of headlines with brief impact notes | Cross-check with sentiment shifts |
| Market reaction indicators | If available, implied vol, options activity around GOOGL | Indicates sentiment durability and event risk |
| Risk signals | Any sentiment spikes aligned with negative news | Potential short-term pullbacks or buy-the-dip opportunities |
| Catalyst windows | Upcoming events (earnings, product launches) | Prepare for volatility around events |

What I can do next (once the Reddit tool is back up)
- Re-run get_reddit_stock_info for GOOGL with curr_date 2025-09-12 (and/or adjust the window) and generate a detailed, trader-focused report with a filled-out sentiment profile and a news synthesis.
- Deliver a final Markdown-format report that includes the filled-in table, a narrative analysis, and actionable takeaways.

Would you like me to:
A) Retry the Reddit data fetch now and proceed with the full, data-backed report as soon as it succeeds, or
B) Proceed with a high-level, data-agnostic version using general context about Alphabet (with explicit caveats about lack of Reddit data), or
C) Use a different data window (e.g., last 5 days) once the tool is available?

If you prefer, I can also generate a more speculative trader-oriented overview now (without Reddit data) and clearly label it as qualitative guidance, so you have something actionable while we wait for the data tool to come back.
