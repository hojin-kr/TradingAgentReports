I ran into a data-access error pulling NFLX data in this environment (FileNotFoundError). I can’t generate the live indicator readings right now. I can retry fetching the data now, or proceed with a detailed, framework-based analysis you can apply once the data is available. Below is a rigorous plan and an recommended indicator set (8 indicators) that provides complementary insights for NFLX.

Indicator set I propose (8 indicators, balanced across trend, momentum, volatility, and volume)
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum; captures quick shifts and potential entries. Use with longer-term trends to filter noise.
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend benchmark; helps identify the ongoing trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend baseline; useful for confirming overall market regime and for golden/death-cross context.
- macd: Momentum gauge; MACD line crossovers signal potential trend changes; useful in conjunction with price and trend indicators.
- macds: MACD signal line; crossovers with MACD provide additional confirmation for entries/exits.
- rsi: Momentum strength and potential reversal indicator; watch for overbought/oversold levels and divergences, especially when confluences with trend are present.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20-SMA); baseline for price action relative to a standard deviation envelope; helps identify consolidations, breakouts, and mean-reversion tendencies.
- atr: Volatility measure; informs risk management, stop placements, and sizing to adapt to changing volatility.

Why these 8 are suitable for NFLX right now
- NFLX is often driven by a mix of trend-following dynamics and rapid momentum shifts around earnings, product announcements, or subscriber trends. The combination of 10-EMA and 50/200 SMAs covers short-, medium-, and long-term views to catch shifts without overreacting to noise.
- The MACD pair (macd and macds) provides robust momentum signals, which helps in confirming trend initiation or reversal when price action aligns with moving-average cues.
- RSI adds a momentum-oscillator perspective to flag overbought/oversold conditions and possible reversals, especially in uptrends where RSI can stay elevated for extended periods.
- Bollinger middle with the associated volatility framework (via ATR) helps distinguish normal pullbacks within an uptrend from meaningful breakouts or reversals, and informs risk controls.
- This set avoids redundancy (e.g., not pairing stochastic RSI here) while delivering a well-rounded view: trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context will be added when we can fetch VWMA later.

What I will deliver once data is available
- A holistic trends report:
  - Trend orientation: price relative to 50-SMA and 200-SMA; look for crossovers (e.g., price crossing above 50-SMA with 200-SMA trending up vs. cross-down scenarios).
  - Short-term momentum cues: 10-EMA direction and MACD/macds signals; crossovers around key support/resistance levels.
  - Momentum strength and divergence signals: RSI readings in the context of the prevailing trend.
  - Volatility and breakout context: Bollinger middle position, band interaction (upper/lower band behavior when data is available), and ATR-driven volatility assessment.
  - Risk considerations: ATR-informed stop placement and position sizing guidance.
- Trading signals (if you want): structured entry, exit, and stop rules built from confluence of indicators (e.g., long entry when price trades above 50-SMA, MACD bullish, RSI rising but not overbought, and price near/above lower Bollinger band with rising ATR).
- Visuals and narrative: clear notes on how current NFLX dynamics align with each indicator, including any potential divergences or confirmations.

Next steps
- Option A: I retry data retrieval now and then produce a full, live-readout with the 8 indicators and a detailed trend report.
- Option B: Proceed with a qualitative framework now (without live numbers) so you have immediate guidance, and we fetch data to fill in exact readings later.
- Option C: If you have a local data file or another data source you trust, you can provide NFLX price data (dates and OHLCV), and I’ll compute the indicators and deliver the full report.

Markdown table: key points to organize the plan (to be used once data is available)
| Indicator | Category | What it measures | How to interpret in NFLX context |
|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| close_10_ema | Moving Average | Short-term momentum; recent price bias | If price above 10-EMA and rising, suggests short-term bullish momentum; cross below can signal a pullback or reversal. |
| close_50_sma | Moving Average | Medium-term trend direction | Price above 50-SMA indicates uptrend bias; price below suggests downtrend bias; watch for cross with 200-SMA for trend regime shifts. |
| close_200_sma | Moving Average | Long-term trend direction | Price above 200-SMA = long-term uptrend (bullish regime); price below = long-term downtrend (bearish regime). |
| macd | Momentum | MACD line relative to zero and crossovers | bullish cross (MACD above signal) supports up-move; bearish cross supports downside; use with price trend for confirmation. |
| macds | Momentum | MACD signal line cross | Cross of MACD above MACDS reinforces bullish momentum; below reinforces bearish momentum. |
| rsi | Momentum | Momentum strength and potential reversals | Rising RSI with price strength supports continuation; overbought readings near 70+ warrant caution; divergences can precede reversals. |
| boll | Volatility/Mean Reversion | Price relative to 20-SMA baseline | Price near/above upper band or near lower band with widening bands suggests breakout pressure or heightened volatility; mean-reversion cues when near middle band. |
| atr | Volatility | Average true range; volatility level | Rising ATR indicates expanding volatility (higher risk, larger stops); falling ATR suggests compression and potential consolidation. |

If you’d like, I can retry fetching NFLX data now and then provide the full, numbered analysis with live readings as soon as the data retrieval succeeds. Which option would you prefer? Option A (retry now) or Option B (proceed with framework for now)?
