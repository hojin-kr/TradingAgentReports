Thanks for the prompt. Quick status update:

- I attempted to fetch Reddit-based stock news for NFLX on 2025-09-12, but the tool is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError from get_reddit_stock_info. I tried twice, and both attempts failed.

What I can do next (pick one):
- Retry automatically: I can keep trying at short intervals (e.g., every few minutes) until the tool responds.
- Proceed with alternative sources: I can produce a comprehensive NFLX report focusing on sentiment and news from non-Reddit sources (e.g., general press coverage, earnings/PR, mainstream social chatter) and clearly annotate that Reddit data is unavailable this cycle.
- Wait for tool to come back online: If you prefer, Iâ€™ll pause until the Reddit tool is functioning again and then run the full Reddit+news analysis.

If you want me to proceed now, I can deliver a thorough long-form NFLX report using non-Reddit sources and outline how Reddit data would have influenced the conclusions once the tool is back. I can also provide a Markdown table layout at the end to organize key takeaways.

Please tell me which path you prefer:
- Retry now
- Proceed with non-Reddit sources (and clearly flag Reddit data as unavailable)
- Wait and retry later (specify a window)
