I attempted to fetch ORCL data and compute the eight indicators, but the data retrieval service returned a FileNotFoundError. Specifically, the calls to get_YFin_data and the get_stockstats_indicators_report calls currently failed with a “No such file or directory” error. I can retry the data pull, or I can proceed with the planning and indicator setup now and run the calculations as soon as the data channel is restored. Please tell me if I should retry immediately.

In the meantime, here is a robust, non-redundant set of up to 8 indicators I’ll use for ORCL (Oracle) to give you a diverse, complementary view of the market conditions. This selection avoids redundancy (e.g., not both stochastic RSI if we’re using RSI) and balances trend, momentum, volatility, and volume context.

Selected indicators (8 total)
- close_50_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps confirm whether price is above/below the mid-term trend, useful for filtering entries in a stock like ORCL which can move in sustained trend periods.
- close_200_sma
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful for identifying major trend regime (golden/death cross tendencies) and for strategic bias alignment.
- close_10_ema
  - Category: Moving Averages
  - Rationale: Responsive short-term momentum. Captures quick shifts and potential entry/exit timing in choppier periods; should be used with longer-term averages for filtering.
- macd
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: Core momentum signal via EMA differences. Crossovers can indicate trend changes; combined with other filters to reduce false signals in low-volatility or sideways markets.
- macdh
  - Category: MACD Related
  - Rationale: MACD histogram shows momentum strength and potential divergence early. Helps gauge the thrust and possible exhaustion ahead of a price move.
- rsi
  - Category: Momentum Indicators
  - Rationale: Momentum gauge with overbought/oversold cues. Use with trend context; RSI in strong uptrends can stay overbought for extended periods, so corroborate with trend indicators.
- boll
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Rationale: Bollinger middle (20 SMA) as a baseline benchmark. Helps assess current volatility regime and potential breakout/reversal zones when used with bands.
- atr
  - Category: Volatility Indicators
  - Rationale: True range-based volatility measure to inform risk management (stop placement and position sizing). Reactive but critical for dynamic risk controls.

Why this mix is suitable for ORCL right now
- ORCL often trades in ranges during some cycles and breaks into trend phases on macro/cloud/enterprise software catalysts. The combination above covers:
  - Trend confirmation (50/200 SMAs) and quick momentum shifts (10 EMA, MACD, MACD histogram) to catch early moves.
  - Momentum validation and extents (RSI) to filter noise and recognize potential reversals in conjunction with trend signals.
  - Volatility context (boll middle for dynamic baseline, ATR for risk sizing) to adapt strategies to current volatility regimes.
- This set provides complementary angles:
  - Trend vs momentum: cross-check signals across SMA and MACD family with RSI.
  - Price deviation vs volatility: Boll middle plus ATR informs when price is pressing bands or when volatility is expanding/squeezing.
  - Volume-independent and volume-aware perspective: VWMA is not included here due to the 8-indicator limit, but the chosen indicators still deliver a broad spectrum of insights.

What happens next (once data is available)
- I will fetch ORCL price history for the requested window and compute the eight indicators above.
- I’ll produce a detailed, nuanced report that includes:
  - Current trend assessment across timeframes (short via 10 EMA, medium via 50 SMA, long via 200 SMA).
  - Momentum signal interpretation (MACD cross/Histogram strength, RSI level and potential divergences).
  - Volatility regime and breakout/mean-reversion context (boll middle, Bollinger band cues, ATR for risk management).
  - Scenario-based implications (e.g., if MACD is positive with price above 50/200 SMA and RSI > 60, look for trend-following entries; if MACD histogram is waning while price tests the lower Bollinger band, consider a potential reversal risk).
  - Practical entry/exit ideas, stop placement approach referencing ATR, and risk notes given current volatility.
  - Potential caveats tailored to Oracle’s typical price behavior around major product/news catalysts.

Proposed final deliverable format
- A detailed narrative analysis with nuanced interpretations.
- A concise, action-oriented summary of signals to watch.
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing the key indicators, their read, and the suggested actions.

Markdown table (structure to be filled with actual data once retrieved)

- close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend benchmark |  |  | 
- close_10_ema | Moving Averages | Short-term momentum |  |  | 
- macd | MACD Related | Momentum cross/changes |  |  | 
- macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength via histogram |  |  | 
- rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold context |  |  | 
- boll | Volatility Indicators | Baseline volatility context |  |  |

Next steps
- Please confirm if I should retry the data pull now. If you have a preferred date range or data source (e.g., a different time horizon for ORCL), let me know and I’ll adjust.
- Once the data is retrieved, I’ll deliver the full, detailed report with the 8 indicators and the final Markdown table filled with the current readings and actionable insights.
