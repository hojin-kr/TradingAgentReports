Sorry—the Reddit data fetch for AMD on 2025-09-18 ran into a backend file error (FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory). I can retry the fetch, or I can proceed with a qualitative framework now while we wait for the data source to come back online. Please choose:

- Retry now
- Proceed with a qualitative AMD social-sentiment and news framework (no live data yet)
- Use an alternative data source if you have one

If you’d like me to proceed with the qualitative framework, here’s how I’ll structure the long report and what I’ll look for (without live numbers until the tool is available again):

What I’ll analyze
- Social media sentiment: daily sentiment and volume trends for AMD over the past week, focusing on Reddit and similar platforms as available.
- Key themes: gaming GPU demand vs. AI accelerator discussions, product cycle chatter (RDNA/instinct/MI), pricing and availability concerns, new product rumors or releases, supply chain and manufacturing chatter, leadership/strategy mentions.
- Recent company news: earnings headlines, product launches, partnerships, capacity updates, regulatory or geopolitical factors impacting AMD (e.g., supplier news, foundry relationships, AI market developments).
- Implications for traders/investors: catalysts (new product announcements, quarterly results, AI demand shifts), risk factors (pricing pressure, supply constraints, competition), sentiment vs. price action signals (e.g., spike in bearish/bullish chatter preceding earnings).
- Cross-asset context: how AMD sentiment aligns or diverges from broader semis/equipment cycles and major AI/chips news.

Proposed deliverable format
- Executive snapshot: current mood and notable risk/cocus points for the week
- Thematic deep-dive: 3–5 key themes driving sentiment with nuance (what people are praising, criticizing, or uncertain about)
- News pulse: 4–6 headline drivers from the past week and their potential impact
- Trader takeaways: actionable observations, potential catalysts, risk flags, and suggested trade-note ideas (e.g., earnings timing, event-driven moves, volatility considerations)
- Data notes: any data gaps or caveats due to missing live data
- Markdown table (end): a compact, readable handle of key points

- Date
- Daily Sentiment (Tone: Positive/Neutral/Negative)
- Top Theme(s)
- Notable Posts/Events
- News Highlights
- Potential Catalyst
- Trader Takeaway

If you want, I can also present a preliminary outline with hypothetical placeholders (e.g., “Positive on AI accelerator chatter; negative on supply chain concerns”) to give you a sense of structure while we await the live data.

Would you like me to:
1) retry the Reddit data fetch now, or
2) proceed with the qualitative framework right away (with placeholders until data comes back)?
