I attempted to fetch AMD price data for the requested window (2024-09-18 to 2025-09-18) but the data retrieval failed due to a backend FileNotFoundError. This looks like a temporary data access issue on the tool side. I can retry shortly, or you can specify a different date range or try again later. In the meantime, here’s a plan and the indicator set I would use once the data is available.

Chosen indicators (8 total) with rationale
- close_50_sma (50-day Simple Moving Average)
  - What it provides: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - Why it’s suitable for AMD: AMD often moves with macro tech demand and sector cycles; the 50-SMA helps filter noisy moves and confirms whether price remains above/below a key trend line.

- close_200_sma (200-day Simple Moving Average)
  - What it provides: Long-term trend baseline; helps identify major trend regime (golden/death cross context).
  - Why it’s suitable for AMD: Helps distinguish secular uptrends from corrective phases in a high-volatility sector like semis.

- close_10_ema (10-day Exponential Moving Average)
  - What it provides: Responsive short-term momentum.
  - Why it’s suitable for AMD: Captures quick shifts around catalysts (chip cycles, AI demand news) and can flag early momentum changes when used with longer averages.

- macd (MACD line)
  - What it provides: Momentum and potential trend changes via EMA crossovers.
  - Why it’s suitable for AMD: Adds a timing layer around momentum shifts, especially around earnings announcements or macro inflection points.

- macds (MACD Signal)
  - What it provides: Smoothing of MACD; crossovers with MACD line generate trading signals.
  - Why it’s suitable for AMD: Helps filter MACD cross signals to reduce false entries in volatile sessions.

- macdh (MACD Histogram)
  - What it provides: Momentum strength and divergence signals through the gap between MACD and its signal.
  - Why it’s suitable for AMD: Divergences can precede trend changes around major product cycles or guidance updates.

- rsi (RSI)
  - What it provides: Momentum indicator showing overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals.
  - Why it’s suitable for AMD: Useful to gauge pullbacks in uptrends or confirm exhaustion in move-driven rallies, especially when combined with trend filters.

- atr (Average True Range)
  - What it provides: A measure of volatility and a basis for risk management (stop placement, position sizing).
  - Why it’s suitable for AMD: Semis can be volatile around earnings or supply-chain news; ATR helps adjust risk as volatility expands/contracts.

What to expect in the final data-driven report (when data loads)
- A detailed, nuanced assessment of AMD’s trend status (short-, medium-, and long-term) using the 50/200 SMA framework.
- Momentum analysis via MACD (MACD line, Signal, Histogram) with cross confirmations to identify potential entries or exits.
- Momentum strength and possible reversals with RSI, including divergence checks where applicable.
- Volatility context from ATR to frame risk management decisions and position sizing.
- A concise interpretation of how these signals align or conflict, and practical trade ideas (entries, exits, stop levels) aligned to a defined horizon.

Next steps
- I can retry fetching the data now or at a time you prefer. If you’d like, I can also:
  - Change the date range (e.g., recent year, or a shorter window around a known catalyst).
  - Add/remove indicators (up to 8 total as requested) based on your trading style (e.g., include VWMA for volume confirmation or Bollinger measures for breakout context).

Would you like me to retry immediately, or adjust the date range or indicator set? If you want, I can also proceed with a ready-to-run template analysis using these 8 indicators once the data fetch succeeds.

Appendix: Quick reference table of the indicator set (for AMD)
- close_50_sma: Medium-term trend, dynamic support/resistance
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark, trend regime
- close_10_ema: Short-term momentum capture
- macd: Momentum/trend-change signals
- macds: MACD signal cross confirmations
- macdh: Momentum strength/divergence via histogram
- rsi: Overbought/oversold momentum checks
- atr: Volatility and risk management

Table: Key points to watch (structure you’ll see in the final report)
| Indicator | What it measures | How it helps AMD trading | Caveats / notes |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| close_50_sma | 50-day trend, dynamic support | Confirms mid-term direction and support levels | Lags price; use with faster signals |
| close_200_sma | 200-day trend, macro regime | Validates secular trend; signals long-term bias | Slow to react; not for timing alone |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum | Detects quick shifts near catalysts | Prone to noise; needs filter |
| macd | Momentum/trend changes | Early momentum shifts, trend-change signals | Use with other filters to avoid false positives |
| macds | MACD signal smoothing | Crosses refine MACD-based entries/exits | Always verify with price action |
| macdh | Momentum strength/divergence | Divergences can precede reversals | Histogram can be volatile |
| rsi | Momentum strength, overbought/oversold | Reversals around pullbacks; confirm with trend | Strong trends can push RSI extreme; use with trend context |
| atr | Volatility magnitude | Guides risk management and stop placement | Reactive measure; pair with position sizing |

If you want, I can proceed with the data fetch as soon as the backend issue is resolved, and I’ll deliver the full, data-driven report with the 8 indicators and the final insights table.
