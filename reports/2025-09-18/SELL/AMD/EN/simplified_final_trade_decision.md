# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD faces near-term pressures from AI demand timing, Nvidia’s leadership, and a concentrated data-center business. Sell/Underweight now with hedging and re-evaluate in 1–3 quarters.

## Investment Decision
Sell/Underweight AMD now with a disciplined hedged plan; re-evaluate in 1–3 quarters. Confidence: Moderate.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- AI demand cadence risk: AI-related spending could slow or be more selective, limiting upside in the near term.
- Competitive hurdle: Nvidia’s leadership raises the bar for durable gains in AMD’s margins and market share.
- Concentrated exposure: Heavy reliance on data-center customers and hyperscalers makes results sensitive to capex swings and workload mix.
- Valuation risk: High expectations for data-center growth and margin expansion imply potential price multiple compression if results soften.
- Profitability signals uncertain: Backlog, data-center mix, and ROCm software adoption need clearer proof of durable margin improvement.
- Hedging and re-entry logic: A disciplined hedge allows capital protection while providing optionality if data points improve over 1–3 quarters.

## Risks To Watch
- Data-center demand and backlog: Any weakness or slower-than-expected margin improvement in data-center segments.
- AI cycle timing: If AI-related spending slows or is delayed, upside guidance could weaken.
- Competition and pricing: Nvidia’s momentum and pricing power could pressure AMD’s market share and gross margins.
- Customer and seasonality risk: Dependence on a few hyperscalers; shifts in workload mix or annual capex cycles.
- Supply chain and execution: Dependence on TSMC, packaging, and potential geopolitical frictions that could affect cost and cadence.
- Valuation sensitivity: Any miss on revenue mix, margins, or key licensing/ROCm milestones could lead to sharper multiple compression.
- Macro/regulatory factors: Economic slowdown, policy changes, or trade tensions affecting tech spending.
