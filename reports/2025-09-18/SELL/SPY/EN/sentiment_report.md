I started pulling the Reddit-based sentiment for SPY on 2025-09-18, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a tool error rather than data absence. I can try again, or we can proceed with a plan that doesn’t depend on that single data source right now.

Options to proceed:
- Option 1: Retry the Reddit data fetch now (in case the issue is transient) and then produce the full comprehensive report with daily sentiment, news, and insights.
- Option 2: Proceed with a qualitative, data-light version of the report that focuses on macro news and typical ETF sentiment signals (without the Reddit data) and outline what we would fill in once the Reddit data is available.

If you’d like, I can do either. A quick plan for the full, final report (to be delivered once data is available) would look like:
- Executive snapshot: Current stance for SPY (risk-on vs risk-off context), key macro drivers (Fed policy, inflation, GDP data), and recent price action context.
- Social sentiment methodology: How we collect and categorize sentiment from Reddit and other sources, date ranges, and any weighting used.
- Daily sentiment results (last 7 days): For each day, sentiment polarity (positive/neutral/negative), topic clusters (market breadth, rate expectations, macro news), and notable spikes.
- Notable themes by day: What people talked about (e.g., Fed commentary, employment data, geopolitical events) and how that might drive SPY moves.
- News roundup: Summary of major news events affecting SPY/market sentiment over the past week, with brief implications for traders.
- Price-action context: How sentiment aligned with price moves, volume, and intraday volatility.
- Implications for traders:
  - Short-term (intraday to 3 days): potential signals from sentiment shifts, key levels to watch.
  - Mid-term (1–4 weeks): how macro news and social sentiment might shape trend or range-bound behavior.
  - Risk considerations: events that could trigger sharp reversals, liquidity concerns, or regime shifts.
- Positioning hypotheses: Scenarios (bullish, bearish, neutral) with triggers and risk controls.
- Key takeaways and actionable insights for traders.
- Markdown table: A concise at-a-glance summary of key points, themes, and implications.

If you want me to proceed now with Option 1 (retry Reddit data) or Option 2 (qualitative framework), tell me which you prefer and I’ll execute accordingly. Also, if you have alternate sources you want included (e.g., Twitter/X mentions, StockTwits, major financial news feeds), I can incorporate those once data access is available.
