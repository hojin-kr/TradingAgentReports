I attempted to fetch META data and compute the 8 indicators you’ve specified, but the data-retrieval tools returned a FileNotFoundError (environment issue). I’m happy to retry automatically, but I wanted to be transparent about the current obstacle. If you’d like, I can re-run now or retry in a moment and then deliver the full, detailed report as requested. In the meantime, here’s exactly what I plan to deliver and why these indicators are well-suited for META in a generic, balanced-setup context.

8 indicators I’ll use (non-redundant, complementary)
1) close_10_ema
- Rationale: A responsive short-term momentum signal to detect quick shifts in META’s price action. Helps identify timely entries/exits when the stock is already trending.

2) close_50_sma
- Rationale: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Useful to confirm the prevailing trend when paired with faster signals.

3) close_200_sma
- Rationale: Long-term trend benchmark. Helps identify major trend direction and potential golden/death cross contexts for strategic framing.

4) macd
- Rationale: Momentum gauge. MACD crossovers and histogram behavior help spot potential trend changes and confirm momentum shifts alongside price action.

5) macds
- Rationale: The MACD signal line. Crossovers with MACD add another layer of confirmation for trade timing.

6) macdh
- Rationale: MACD histogram. Momentum strength visualization and divergence cues can give early warning of waning momentum or strength.

7) rsi
- Rationale: Momentum/overbought-oversold context. Helps flag potential reversals or consolidation when combined with trend direction.

8) atr
- Rationale: Volatility measure for risk management. Guides stop placement and position sizing relative to current volatility, important for META’s often choppy moves around earnings/industry news.

What I’ll deliver (once data is loaded)
- A very detailed, nuanced narrative covering:
  - Trend assessment: Where price sits relative to 10-EMA, 50-SMA, and 200-SMA; alignment of the three MA signals; any recent crossovers; how well the price respects the MA “zones” as support/resistance.
  - Momentum and timing: MACD, MACD signal, and MACD histogram readings; crossovers/divergence relative to price moves; RSI level relative to 30/70 with any notable divergences; momentum consistency or deceleration.
  - Volatility and risk: ATR level today versus its recent range; implications for stop placement and position sizing; how volatility interacts with the MA and MACD signals.
  - Confluence analysis: Where MAs, MACD readings, RSI, and ATR align to strengthen a potential directional bias; identification of potential false signals if indicators disagree.
  - Structural interpretation for META: Contextual notes (without forecasting earnings or external events) on how the current indicator regime could influence entry/exit timing, risk controls, and optional trailing stops.
  - Practical implications: Suggested risk-management actions (e.g., stop-distance guidelines anchored on ATR, position-size considerations given volatility) and what to watch for in the next 1–2 weeks.

- A Markdown table at the end organizing key points for quick review. Example structure (to be filled with actual values once data loads):
  - Indicator | Current reading | What it suggests | Trade implication
  - close_10_ema | … | … | …
  - close_50_sma | … | … | …
  - close_200_sma | … | … | …
  - macd | … | … | …
  - macds | … | … | …
  - macdh | … | … | …
  - rsi | … | … | …
  - atr | … | … | …

What I need from you to proceed
- Please tell me if you’d like me to retry the data fetch immediately. I will:
  - Re-run get_YFin_data for META (2025-08-01 to 2025-09-18) and compute the 8 indicators listed above.
  - Then provide the full, detailed report with the narrative plus the Markdown table.
- If you prefer, I can also proceed with a fallback plan: after a few retry attempts, I can deliver a qualitative, rule-based framework for META using these indicators (without numeric readings) to help guide decisions in the absence of fresh data. However, this would be less precise than a data-driven report.

Please let me know how you’d like to proceed:
- Retry now and deliver the full report when data is retrieved, or
- Try again after a short delay, or
- Switch to a qualitative framework right away if you need immediate guidance.
