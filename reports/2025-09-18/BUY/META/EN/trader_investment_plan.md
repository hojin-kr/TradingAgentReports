Decision: Proceed with Option A (data-driven validation) to confirm the META thesis with fresh indicator readings. I’ll implement the plan with real-time technical inputs and adjust the stance only if the data confirms a constructive setup.

Rationale for a Buy stance (with risk discipline)
- Core conviction: META has durable monetization optionality from AI-enabled ad optimization across its family of apps, plus optional long-horizon upside from AR/AI initiatives that could expand engagement and monetization surfaces.
- Catalysts and liquidity: EU regulatory relief, a strong balance sheet, and near-term catalysts such as AI tooling improvements and Connect-related signals can help shift sentiment and justify a higher multiple if momentum confirms.
- Manageable near-term risks: Margin pressure from AI/capex and AR hardware timing are acknowledged, but can be mitigated with disciplined risk controls, hedges around key catalysts, and a staged entry.

Structured, risk-managed plan (to be validated with data)
- Positioning and sizing
  - Initiate a small starter position on a pullback to established support with bullish confirmation. If already long, consider scaling on confirmed momentum or a clean breakout.
  - Target tiered exposure: start at 2-4% of the portfolio, scale to 6-8% on sustained momentum signals and broad trend confirmation.
- Risk management
  - Use ATR-based stops (e.g., 1.5–2.5x ATR) to align with current volatility.
  - Cap single-name exposure to a defined portion of total risk capital (e.g., 6-8%), unless a strong breakout justifies higher sizing.
  - Event hedging around catalysts (Connect, regulatory updates, hardware milestones) with collars or protective puts sized to limit downside while preserving upside.
- Execution plan (pending data)
  - Entry: wait for pullback with bullish confirmations (price action around moving averages, MACD turning positive, RSI not overextended).
  - Monitoring: track momentum and price structure; reassess if price breaks below key support or momentum deteriorates.
  - Data integration: use the 8-indicator framework (close_10_ema, close_50_sma, close_200_sma, macd, macds, macdh, rsi, atr) as the primary lens; if any indicator is unavailable, rely on qualitative guardrails and delay sizing until inputs return.
- Exit plan
  - Take partial profits on meaningful upside with disciplined trailing stops; preserve a core position for multi-quarter thesis.
  - Predefined stop to cap downside; reduce exposure quickly if adverse news or momentum breakdown occurs.
  - If momentum collapses (MACD weakens, price breaks below major moving averages, RSI divergence), trim or exit to preserve capital.
- Data and review cadence
  - Run the 8 indicators and deliver a concise read with actionable signals. Layer in sentiment and news signals but keep them as confirmatory rather than primary drivers.
  - Maintain a dynamic watch around Connect and regulatory updates to adjust hedges and sizing as needed.

Notes on risk and learning
- Do not rely on a single catalyst; rely on multi-signal confirmation and a disciplined risk framework.
- Data gaps can be risky; pair quantitative signals with robust guardrails.
- Avoid excessive hype around AI; anchor on durable moats, real monetization progress, and observable catalysts.

Next steps
- I’ll pull the 8 indicators and deliver the data-driven read before you take further action. If you want to proceed immediately, I’ll provide the updated readings and interpretation in the next update.

Would you like me to proceed with the data pull now (Option A) to validate the plan with fresh indicator readings, or would you prefer a purely qualitative framework (Option B) and I return with numbers later?
