Thanks for the prompt. I attempted to fetch the requested insider sentiment, insider transactions, and quarterly financial statements for AAPL as of 2025-09-18, but I hit a tool/environment error (FileNotFoundError) from the data fetchers. This looks like a temporary issue with the data backend. I can try again, or we can proceed with a structured qualitative analysis in the meantime and fill in the numeric details as soon as the data fetch is successful.

What I can do next (options):
- Retry data retrieval now (sequentially if parallel calls fail) to pull:
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment (AAPL, 2025-09-18)
  - get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions (AAPL, 2025-09-18)
  - get_simfin_balance_sheet (AAPL, quarterly, 2025-09-18)
  - get_simfin_cashflow (AAPL, quarterly, 2025-09-18)
  - get_simfin_income_stmt (AAPL, quarterly, 2025-09-18)
- If the tools continue to fail, proceed with a thorough qualitative fundamentals framework for AAPL based on the latest public data available up to 2024/early 2025, clearly caveated as not live data, and outline the exact data points I would extract once the tools become available.

If you’d like me to proceed immediately with the qualitative framework (no live numbers yet), here’s a comprehensive report structure I will fill in with live data once the tools work again:

What I need from you
- Do you want me to retry pulling the live data now (sequentially to avoid the previous parallel call error), or would you prefer I deliver the qualitative framework first and attempt data retrieval in a follow-up message?
- If you’d like me to retry, I’ll run the five data queries in sequence and then produce a comprehensive, data-filled report with a final section summarizing implications for traders.

If you’d like, I can also proceed with a best-effort qualitative assessment now (without live numbers) and clearly label all data as “to be filled once data is retrieved.” Just say the word and I’ll proceed in that mode.
