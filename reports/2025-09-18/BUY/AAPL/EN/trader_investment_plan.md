Verdict: Buy Apple (AAPL)

Assessment
- The provided plan presents a credible multi-driver thesis: durable cash generation from iPhone, accelerating Services margins, and AI-enabled monetization optionality, supported by a strong balance sheet and capital return framework. While macro/regulatory and China exposure are real headwinds, they appear manageable within a multi-year horizon and are unlikely to erase the core ecosystem moat.
- Risks to monitor include AI monetization timing, regulatory pressures around App Store economics, potential valuation compression in a high-m multiple name, and near-term macro volatility. The plan’s emphasis on risk management and hedging helps protect against interim drawdowns and provides optionality to participate in upside.

Recommendation and execution plan
- Enter AAPL on a staged basis with risk controls:
  - Initiate with 1/3 of the target full position now.
  - Add a second tranche on a modest pullback or near key support levels in the following 4–8 weeks.
  - Consider a final tranche if the stock remains above technical/structural support and the macro backdrop remains constructive.
- Hedging/risk management:
  - Implement a protective hedge (e.g., long puts, or a collar) to cap downside if macro/regulatory news deteriorates. Align the hedge horizon to 6–12 months to cover the near-to-medium-term risk window.
  - Enforce stop discipline with a hard downside trigger (roughly 8–12% per leg from the entry price) to guard against meaningful drawdown.
- Time horizon and catalysts:
  - Time horizon: 12–24 months (or longer) to allow Services growth and AI monetization to materialize.
  - Catalysts to watch: Services growth acceleration, AI feature adoption/monetization progress, progress on domestic manufacturing/capex, and regulatory/App Store developments.
- Monitoring framework:
  - Use a disciplined signal framework (trend, momentum, volatility, volume) to time further add-ons and risk adjustments.
  - Stay mindful of China/regulatory headlines; be prepared to scale back exposure if risk-reward deteriorates.
- Exit/scenario planning:
  - Base case: Hold through mid-term volatility if Services and AI progress remain on track.
  - Trim/exit if Services growth decelerates meaningfully without AI monetization proving durable, or if regulatory/macro shocks trigger outsized multiple compression.

Practical notes
- The plan’s core thesis remains valid: Apple’s ecosystem moat and diversified growth trajectory provide a reasonable multi-year upside, with risk controls in place to mitigate near-term volatility.
- If you’d like, I can provide a data-driven overlay (8-indicator framework) with current signal points and probabilistic PnL impact to complement this stance.
