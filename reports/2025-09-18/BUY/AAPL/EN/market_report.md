Sorry—the data retrieval tool for AAPL data is currently failing (FileNotFoundError). I can’t fetch the CSV right now to compute the indicators, but I can still lay out a robust, complementary 8-indicator framework tailored for AAPL and explain how to use it once the data load succeeds. If you’d like, I can retry automatically and then generate a data-driven report as soon as the data tool is back.

Proposed 8-indicator framework for AAPL (covering trend, momentum, volatility, and volume)

1) close_50_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- Rationale: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance. Helps smooth price action and confirms intermediate trend when combined with faster signals.
- How to use: Look for price crossing above/below the 50 SMA or price riding the 50 SMA during pullbacks in an uptrend. Crossovers with faster metrics (like 10 EMA or MACD) provide timely entries/exits.

2) close_200_sma
- Category: Moving Averages
- Rationale: Long-term trend baseline. Useful for confirming the dominant market regime (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) and for golden/death-cross considerations.
- How to use: Use as a macro filter. Favor long entries when price is above the 200 SMA and the 50 SMA is also above the 200 SMA; consider risk controls if price trades below.

3) macd
- Category: MACD Related
- Rationale: Momentum and trend-change signal via EMAs. Provides crossovers and divergence signals that often precede price moves.
- How to use: Watch for MACD line crossing the MACDs line and for MACD histogram momentum shifts. Confirm with price action and other indicators in choppy markets.

4) macds
- Category: MACD Related
- Rationale: MACD signal line smoothing; helps reduce false entries from raw MACD crossovers.
- How to use: Use MACD crossing MACDS as a more filtered trigger. Confirm with price trend and support/resistance levels.

5) macdh
- Category: MACD Related
- Rationale: Momentum strength visual via histogram; divergence with price can flag early trend weakening or acceleration.
- How to use: Monitor histogram bars increasing in the direction of the trend for sustained moves; watch for shrinking bars or bearish divergence as a warning.

6) rsi
- Category: Momentum Indicators
- Rationale: Momentum gauge to spot overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals.
- How to use: Typical signals at 70/30 thresholds; look for bullish/bearish divergences with price. In strong trends RSI can stay extended, so use it with trend context.

7) boll
- Category: Volatility Indicators
- Rationale: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a dynamic benchmark; bands help identify breakouts and reversals in relation to volatility.
- How to use: Breakouts beyond the bands or tightening/expansion of bands can precede move; confirm with volume or momentum filters to avoid false breakouts in range-bound sessions.

8) vwma
- Category: Volume-Based Indicators
- Rationale: Volume-weighted trend confirmation; integrates price action with volume to validate moves.
- How to use: Prefer trades where price action aligns with VWMA direction and volume confirms the move. Be mindful of anomalous volume spikes that may distort interpretation.

How these indicators work together for AAPL
- Trend confirmation: Use close_50_sma and close_200_sma to determine if AAPL is in a bullish, bearish, or sideways regime. Entry signals should align with the broader trend (e.g., price above both SMAs in uptrends).
- Momentum timing: MACD, MACDS, MACDH provide momentum signals to time entries after trend direction is established (e.g., MACD bullish crossover with price above 50/200 SMA).
- Reversion risk management: RSI helps flag potential pullbacks or reversals, especially when momentum strengthens into overbought/oversold zones during uptrends or downtrends.
- Volatility context: Boll (middle) and its relation to price action helps identify potential breakout or consolidation phases. Pair with MACD and RSI to reduce false signals in low-volatility periods.
- Volume validation: VWMA anchors signals with volume, helping to distinguish legit moves from price noise. Volume-supported breakouts or pullbacks tend to be more sustainable.

Possible market scenarios and how to interpret with these indicators
- Scenario A: Uptrend with healthy momentum
  - Price above 200 SMA; 50 SMA rising toward it; MACD above signal with positive histogram; RSI in 50–70 range; VWMA confirms with rising volume; Boll bands moderate to expanding.
- Scenario B: Pullback within uptrend
  - Price tests 50 SMA or VWMA support; MACD slimly positive or turning; RSI dips toward 40–50 but not oversold; Boll middle holds as floor; watch for bullish reversal signals to re-enter.
- Scenario C: Sideways/low-volatility regime
  - Price meanders around the 50/200 SMA; MACD flat; RSI around 50; Boll bands narrow; VWMA shows mixed volume. Signals are weaker; prefer range-defined entries with tight risk controls.
- Scenario D: Breakout in high volatility
  - Price breaks above upper Boll band with increasing VWMA-confirmed volume; MACD momentum strengthens; RSI may push into overbought territory; use strict risk controls on pullback entries as confirmation.

Notes and considerations
- Data dependency: Once the data CSV loads successfully, I’ll generate a concrete, numbers-driven report with trend lines, crossovers, and date stamps for AAPL, including a synthesized set of buy/hold/sell signals based on these indicators.
- Timeframe alignment: For most swing-to-position trades on AAPL, align the 50/200 SMA signals with MACD and RSI, using VWMA to confirm volume-backed moves. For shorter-term trades in a choppier market, rely more on MACD/MACDS/macdh and RSI with price action around the Boll middle.
- Risk management: Use ATR to set stop levels and position sizing (if you want me to include ATR in the final set). Here I prioritized trend/mo­mentum/volume/volatility combination and kept to 8 indicators.

What I need from you
- If you’d like, I can retry data retrieval automatically and generate a data-driven, granular report (with dates, signals, and performance notes) as soon as the data tool is back.
- If you prefer a different focus, I can swap in a different indicator (e.g., include atr or remove boll) while keeping to 8 indicators.

Markdown table: key points at a glance

|----------|----------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| close_50_sma | Moving Averages | Mid-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance | Price cross above/below 50 SMA; confirm with faster signals | Lags price; use with other indicators for timing |
| close_200_sma | Moving Averages | Long-term trend baseline and regime filter | Price above/below 200 SMA; look for crossovers with 50 SMA | Slower to react; best for strategic context |
| macd | MACD Related | Momentum and trend-change signals | MACD line cross MACDS; zero-line cross | Susceptible in low-volatility markets; confirm with price |
| macds | MACD Related | Filtered MACD momentum signals | MACD crossing MACDS as entry/exit trigger | Requires balance with other filters to avoid noise |
| macdh | MACD Related | Momentum strength and divergence signals | Histogram bars rising/falling; watch for divergences | Can be volatile; combine with price action |
| rsi | Momentum Indicators | Overbought/oversold momentum gauge | RSI 70/30 thresholds; look for divergences | Can remain extended in strong trends; use trend context |
| boll | Volatility Indicators | Volatility-informed benchmark via Bollinger middle | Breakouts or reversals relative to bands; confirm with volume | Signals can be band-riding in strong trends |
| vwma | Volume-Based Indicators | Volume-confirmed price trends | Price action aligned with rising VWMA; validate moves with volume | Volume spikes can distort signals; use with other filters |

If you want me to proceed as soon as the data tool is back, just say “retry data load” and I’ll fetch AAPL data for the latest window and deliver a full, data-driven indicators report with interpretations and actionable signals.
