I ran the data fetch again, but the tool suite is currently returning a FileNotFoundError (system-level issue). Both the parallel multi-tool call and the individual insider sentiment call failed. I don’t have fresh Finnhub/Simfin data for PLTR right now.

Options to proceed:
- Retry now: I can attempt the data fetch again in a moment and proceed with the full fundamental report once the data succeeds.
- Qualitative synthesis now: I can give you a detailed, best-effort qualitative analysis of Palantir (PLTR) fundamentals using publicly known context up to 2024-2025, clearly labeled as non-numeric guidance (no new quarterly figures) and with caveats.
- Alternative data sources: If you have access to other data feeds or want me to use a shorter, non-tool-based summary (e.g., what’s publicly well-known about PLTR’s business model, profitability trajectory, and risky factors), I can do that.

What I will deliver in the full report (once data is fetched):
- Company profile and business model (PLTR’s segments, customers, government/commercial mix, lifecycle).
- Latest quarterly income statement (revenue, gross margin, operating income, net income, EPS) and trends vs prior periods.
- Balance sheet snapshot (assets, liabilities, equity, liquidity indicators).
- Cash flow statement (operating, investing, financing cash flows; free cash flow assessment).
- Key financial ratios and trend analysis (profitability, efficiency, liquidity, solvency).
- Balance sheet/cash flow quality assessment (working capital, cash conversion cycle, capex intensity).
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions (past 15 days) with interpretation.
- Short, medium, and long-term risk factors specific to PLTR (competitive landscape, government exposure, regulatory risk, product adoption, billings and contract risk).
- Trader-oriented insights: fundamental signals, possible mispricings, and what catalysts to watch.
- A concise, easy-to-read Markdown table at the end with key points.

If you’d like me to proceed right away with a qualitative synthesis (no new numeric data), say “Proceed with qualitative PLTR fundamentals.” Otherwise, I’ll retry the data fetch now and deliver the full report as soon as the tools are functioning.
