Thanks for the nudge. I attempted to fetch the Reddit/Stock sentiment data for PLTR for 2025-09-18, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like there’s a temporary issue with the data source integration. I can either retry now, try a different date window, or proceed with a best-effort qualitative analysis using available sources until the tool is fixed. Here’s a productive path I can take right away.

What I can deliver now (structure you’ll get once data is flowing)
- A comprehensive long-form report analyzing PLTR (Palantir) social media sentiment, daily sentiment signals, and relevant company news over the past week (as soon as the data fetch works, I will fill in the exact numbers and day-by-day sentiment curves).
- Detailed insights and actionable implications for traders and investors, including fine-grained themes, catalysts, and risk considerations.
- A concise closing with a clear set of takeaways and potential trade ideas, tailored to different risk appetites.

Draft report framework (you’ll get a filled version once the data source is back online)
1) Executive snapshot
   - Quick-read: current sentiment stance (bullish/bearish/mixed), notable catalysts, and what it implies for PLTR’s near-term trajectory.
2) Social sentiment overview (past 7 days)
   - Overall mood (positive/negative/mixed) with day-by-day delta.
   - Volume trends (relative posting/activity levels) and notable spikes linked to events.
3) Day-by-day sentiment trend (PLTR, last 7 days)
   - Day 1: sentiment, top posts/themes, potential price/volatility implications.
   - Day 2: sentiment, top posts/themes, potential price/volatility implications.
   - …
   - Day 7: sentiment, top posts/themes, potential price/volatility implications.
4) Top themes and signals
   - AI/data analytics adoption; government vs commercial demand; product news; earnings/financials; partnerships; regulatory or privacy discussions; competition.
   - Positive vs negative framing within each theme and the potential impact on sentiment and positioning.
5) News and catalysts (weekly recap)
   - Headlines from social/news outlets (earnings, contracts, product launches, partnerships, regulatory updates).
   - Perceived impact on sentiment and risk/reward backdrop.
6) Market context and options/volatility lens
   - Any notable sentiment shifts around options activity (volume, open interest) and implied volatility tone.
   - Correlation with stock movements (if data available) and how sentiment aligns with price action.
7) Risks and caveats
   - Potential pitfalls from sentiment-driven moves (narrative risk, thin liquidity periods, overhang from big holders, regulatory/regression risks).
8) Trader-oriented take
   - Scenarios for different risk profiles (long-biased, neutral hedges, short-term trading).
   - Suggested watching list and triggers (sentiment threshold changes, thematic shifts, or news catalysts).
9) Final takeaways
   - Clear, concise verdict on how the week’s sentiment and news landscapes shape PLTR’s near-term risk/return profile.

What I propose as next steps
- Retry the Reddit data fetch now (or at a time you prefer) to produce the day-by-day sentiment analysis and the daily sentiment table.
- If you’d like, I can also pull alternative sentiment data temporarily (e.g., StockTwits, X/Twitter sentiment snippets, and major news headlines) to keep the analysis moving while the Reddit feed is down.
- Once the data comes back, I’ll populate the full report and attach the Markdown table at the end, as requested.

If you’d like me to proceed immediately, please indicate:
- Retry now, or
- Use an alternative window (e.g., past 5 days, or rolling 7 days starting from today), or
- Proceed with the skeleton/template version and fill in data as soon as the tool is back online.

In the meantime, here is a starter Markdown table you’ll see filled with real data once the fetch succeeds. It’s a structured snapshot of key dimensions I’ll cover in the full report.

Progress update and request
- The tool error needs to be resolved to provide a fully data-backed, day-by-day sentiment matrix for PLTR. I can retry immediately, or you can tell me to proceed with the skeleton now and fill in the data as soon as the tool is operational again.
- If you prefer, I can also proceed with a parallel plan using publicly available public sentiment signals and general weekly news context to deliver a near-term, data-informed narrative while we wait for the primary data feed to come back online.

Please tell me how you’d like to proceed: retry now, adjust the date window, or proceed with the skeleton and fill in later.
