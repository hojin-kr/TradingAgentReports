I attempted to fetch PLTR data with get_YFin_data for 2024-03-01 to 2025-09-18, but the data service is returning a FileNotFoundError. I retried and got the same error. This looks like a temporary issue with the data connector. I can either keep retrying periodically, or proceed with a best-practice indicator framework now and run the full data-backed analysis as soon as the data fetch works.

Proposed indicator framework for PLTR (8 indicators max, diverse and complementary)
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average
  - What it provides: Medium-term trend direction and dynamic support/resistance.
  - How to use: Look for price crossing above/below the 50SMA as a trend filter. Use with faster signals to time entries.

- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average
  - What it provides: Long-term trend context and major support/resistance level; helps identify golden/death cross setups.
  - How to use: Confirm the overall market regime. A price above the 200SMA suggests bullish context; below suggests bearish context. Use for higher-timeframe alignment.

- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average
  - What it provides: More responsive near-term trend changes.
  - How to use: Watch for rapid shifts in momentum; crossovers with price or with longer averages can signal entries/exits in tighter timeframes.

- macd: MACD line
  - What it provides: Momentum and trend-change signals via EMA differences.
  - How to use: Crossover of MACD line with zero or with a signal line (in macds) can indicate potential entries/exits. Use in conjunction with trend direction from moving averages.

- macds: MACD Signal
  - What it provides: Smoother momentum confirmation
  - How to use: Crossovers with MACD line strengthen signals. Use to filter false positives from MACD alone.

- macdh: MACD Histogram
  - What it provides: Momentum strength and divergence cues
  - How to use: Rising histogram suggests strengthening momentum; declining histogram suggests weakening momentum. Divergence with price can signal reversals.

- rsi: RSI
  - What it provides: Momentum overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals.
  - How to use: Look for overbought (above ~70) or oversold (below ~30) readings, and watch for bullish/bearish divergence with price. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay elevated; use with trend context.

- atr: Average True Range
  - What it provides: Market volatility measure for risk management
  - How to use: Use values to set stop distances and position sizing; higher ATR means wider stops, lower ATR means tighter stops. Helps adapt to changing volatility regimes.

Rationale for this combination
- The 50SMA and 200SMA give a robust sense of trend direction and key level areas, helping you avoid trading against the primary trend.
- The 10EMA adds a more responsive short-term read to catch quicker momentum shifts.
- The MACD trio (macd, macds, macdh) provides layered momentum signals: direction, confirmation, and momentum strength, which is valuable in a stock like PLTR that often shows bursts of momentum.
- RSI adds a momentum reversal lens, useful for spotting potential pullbacks within the prevailing trend or for early reversal signals in range-bound phases.
- ATR anchors risk management to current market volatility, helping to avoid outsized losses in volatile moves.

How I’ll interpret these for PLTR (once data is available)
- If PLTR price is above 50SMA and 200SMA, with MACD positive and MACD histogram rising, and RSI not in overbought extreme, look for continuation signals or pullback entries using the 10EMA as a trigger reference.
- If price crosses below the 50SMA/200SMA together with MACD crossing below and RSI failing to hold, consider downside continuation, but confirm with ATR-based stop levels to manage risk during volatile breaks.
- In choppy/sideways markets, pay close attention to MACD crossovers and RSI divergences to avoid overtrading; use ATR to adjust stop widths to current volatility.
- Use ATR to size positions and place stops beyond recent ATR multiple (e.g., 1.5–2x ATR) to account for current volatility.

Next steps
- I can automatically retry data retrieval at intervals and then run the full indicator calculations to deliver a detailed, trend-focused report for PLTR, including a nuanced interpretation, entry/exit considerations, and a handy summary table.
- If you’d prefer, I can proceed with the 8-indicator framework above as a standing setup and deliver once data becomes available, or you can authorize an alternative data source/method.

Markdown table: Key points of the proposed indicator framework
| Indicator | Role | What to watch | How it complements PLTR analysis |
|----------|------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| close_50_sma | Trend direction & dynamic support/resistance | Price cross above/below 50SMA | Filters trend; pairs with faster signals for entries |
| close_200_sma | Long-term trend context | Price above/below 200SMA; golden/death cross signals | Confirms overall regime; avoids fighting the major trend |
| close_10_ema | Short-term momentum changes | Quick shifts; price/indicator crossovers | Captures early entry/exit points within the trend |
| macd | Momentum direction and trend changes | MACD line cross with zero or with macds | Core momentum signal; use with trend filters |
| macds | Momentum confirmation | MACD line vs MACD Signal | Reduces false positives from MACD alone |
| macdh | Momentum strength | Histogram changes; divergences | Early momentum strength/weakness cues |
| rsi | Overbought/Oversold momentum | 30/70 thresholds; divergences | Reversal signals within trend or range-barreled moves |
| atr | Volatility and risk management | Current ATR magnitude for stops/position sizing | Aligns risk with market activity; dynamic stop placement |

If you’d like, I can keep attempting the data fetch and proceed with the full, data-backed analysis as soon as the tool returns results. Please tell me how you’d like to proceed (retry cadence, or proceed with the framework now and run the full analysis once data is available).
