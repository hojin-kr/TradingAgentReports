I attempted to pull the requested data, but the tool calls returned a FileNotFoundError (environment issue): 
- get_finnhub_company_insider_sentiment for QQQ
- get_finnhub_company_insider_transactions for QQQ
- get_simfin_balance_sheet for QQQ (quarterly)
- get_simfin_cashflow for QQQ (quarterly)
- get_simfin_income_stmt for QQQ (quarterly)

Since QQQ is an ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust) and not a single company, some of these data types (insider sentiment/transactions, company-level balance sheets, cash flows, and income statements) aren’t applicable in the same way they are for an individual issuer. ETFs don’t publish consolidated “company-level” financial statements or insider activity. The most meaningful ETF-level fundamentals are different (AUM, expense ratio, tracking error, liquidity, top holdings, sector/stock concentration, flows, replication method, etc.).

Given the tool errors, here are two practical paths I can take to deliver a thorough, trader-focused fundamental view:

Option A — ETF-centric fundamentals (recommended)
- What to cover:
  - Fund overview: issuer (Invesco), inception, objective, replication method (full replication vs sampling), expense ratio, distribution policy, and domicile.
  - AUM and liquidity: current assets under management, average daily trading volume, bid-ask spread, and turnover.
  - Performance context: historical tracking error vs the Nasdaq-100, and gross/net performance vs the index (YTD, 1Y, 3Y, 5Y if available).
  - Top holdings and concentration: identify the ETF’s top holdings and approximate weights; discuss how concentration in tech mega-caps drives risk/return.
  - Sector and regional exposure: notable tilts (e.g., tech-heavy, software, semiconductors), and any non-US exposure.
  - Flows and sentiment context: recent fund flows (in/out) and how they might affect near-term price/discount/premium vs NAV.
  - Risk considerations: concentration risk, interest-rate sensitivity, tech-sector beta, potential rebalancing effects.
  - Catalysts and risks: earnings season for large holdings, macro tech demand cycles, regulatory headlines, and macro variables (rates, dollar strength).
- Data needs (to complete): current AUM, expense ratio, tracking error, top holdings and weights, sector exposure, liquidity metrics, recent flow data. I can fetch these from ETF data sources and fund filings if you enable me to retry or switch to ETF-focused sources.

Option B — Holdings-based fundamental view (if you want deeper, more granular insight)
- Build a view by analyzing the ETF’s largest components (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, etc.) using the same fundamental data tools (balance sheets, income statements, cash flow) for those constituents.
- Then synthesize how those components’ fundamentals drive QQQ’s risk/return profile, including upside/downside catalysts and sensitivity to macro factors.
- Note: I’ll need current holdings weights and the list of top holdings, which I can pull if the data access is functioning or if you approve using publicly available holdings data.

What I propose we do next
- Option A: I retry ETF-centric fundamentals once I can access reliable data sources (or you allow me to switch to ETF data feeds). I’ll produce a comprehensive, trader-focused report with a Markdown table at the end.
- Option B: I proceed with a holdings-based approach using the ETF’s top holdings to infer the fundamental exposure, if you’d like that level of granularity right away.

Important note about the data you asked for
- Insider sentiment and insider transactions are not typically applicable to an ETF like QQQ. If you want, I can note that limitation explicitly and focus on ETF-specific fundamentals instead.
- If you want to proceed immediately, please confirm that you’re happy with ETF-focused fundamentals (Option A) or Holdings-based fundamentals (Option B). I’ll proceed accordingly and retry any data pulls as needed.

Would you like me to:
1) Retry the ETF-focused fundamental pull (Option A), or
2) Switch to a holdings-driven fundamental analysis (Option B), or
3) Wait for the data sources to be accessible and then deliver the full report with a Markdown table?
