I tried to fetch NVDA data, but the data retrieval service returned an error (FileNotFoundError). I can’t generate the full data-driven trend report until the data source is available. I can retry fetching now, fetch a shorter window, or proceed with a pre-defined indicator framework you can use once the data is in. Which would you prefer?

In the meantime, here is a concise, complementary 8-indicator framework I’ll use once data is accessible. These provide diverse insights (trend, momentum, volatility) without redundancy.

Selected indicators (up to 8, complementary and non-redundant)
- close_50_sma
- close_200_sma
- macd
- macds
- macdh
- rsi
- boll
- atr

Why these are suitable for NVDA
- close_50_sma: Captures medium-term trend direction and acts as dynamic support/resistance. NVDA’s trend cycles over the past year can be interpreted against this line to gauge pullbacks vs. strength.
- close_200_sma: Long-term trend benchmark. Useful to confirm whether NVDA remains in a long-term uptrend or is facing a potential reversal. Golden/death cross signals can provide strategic context for larger-position decisions.
- macd: Momentum-based signal generator. MACD crossovers help identify potential trend changes in NVDA, especially useful in a stock with pronounced volatility.
- macds: MACD signal line, smoothing of MACD. Crossovers with the MACD line reinforce signals and help reduce false positives in fast-moving periods.
- macdh: MACD histogram, momentum strength. Divergence or expansion/contraction of momentum can precede price moves, offering early-warning cues.
- rsi: Measures relative momentum and overbought/oversold conditions. Useful for spotting potential reversals or for confirming trend-based entries when used with trend indicators; be mindful that strong uptrends can push RSI into overbought territory for extended periods.
- boll: Bollinger Middle (20 SMA) as a dynamic baseline for price action. Together with bands, it helps identify breakout zones and mean-reversion tendencies around the baseline.
- atr: A measure of volatility, essential for risk management. Helps set stop levels and position sizing relative to current NVDA volatility; particularly valuable for a name with episodic, sharp moves.

Next steps
- Option A: I retry data fetch now to generate the full, data-backed report.
- Option B: You confirm a shorter window (e.g., last 3–6 months) for a quicker turnaround if the service is flaky.
- Option C: You proceed with the 8-indicator framework and I’ll produce the full analysis as soon as data is available.

Would you like me to retry fetching NVDA data now, or proceed with the framework and wait for data to be available? If you want, I can also fetch a narrower window (e.g., 2025-01-01 to 2025-09-18) to see if the issue is data volume. 

Key points for quick reference (planned workflow once data is available)
- Cross-check 50_sma vs 200_sma for trend confirmation and golden/death cross signals.
- Monitor MACD, MACD Signal, and MACD Histogram for momentum shifts and divergence with price.
- Use RSI to time entries/returns within the context of the prevailing trend and potential divergences.
- Apply Bollinger Middle and Bands to identify breakouts or pullbacks around a dynamic baseline.
- Use ATR to set risk controls and adapt position sizing to current NVDA volatility.
