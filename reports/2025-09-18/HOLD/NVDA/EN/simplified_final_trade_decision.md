# Investment Report: NVDA
## Executive Summary
Holding NVDA today due to near-term China and regulatory risks and a rich valuation. The long-run AI compute growth remains intact, but progress depends on clearer non-China momentum and a durable uptrend.

## Investment Decision
- Recommendation: Hold NVDA
- Confidence Level: Medium

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term headwinds from China and regulators could weigh on results, tempering visibility.
- The stock trades at a high price relative to earnings; the long-run AI compute growth remains a potential upside if non-China demand strengthens.
- A multi-factor technical overlay should guide timing; upgrade only with clear, durable uptrend and confirming data signals.
- Maintaining a core, modest position with risk controls preserves optionality for a later upgrade if signals improve.

## Risks To Watch
- Intensified regulatory actions or China headwinds that materially worsen results.
- Non-China AI demand failing to pick up, reducing upside potential.
- Valuation compression if growth slows or market sentiment worsens.
- Breakdowns in price or momentum that trigger exits or hedging actions.
