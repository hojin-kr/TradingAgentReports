I attempted to fetch the latest insider sentiment, insider transactions, and SimFin financial statements for NVDA, but all tool calls currently result in a FileNotFoundError (missing data files in the environment). Because of this, I can’t pull the live numbers right now. I can still provide a thorough framework for the fundamental analysis and a plan you can follow once the data tools are available again. If you’d like, I can retry later or proceed with a qualitative NVDA fundamental review now and populate the data points once the tools are accessible.

What I can provide now: a comprehensive NVDA fundamentals framework plus a data checklist and interpretation guide you can use immediately, plus a Markdown table to organize key points once data comes back.

1) Company profile (NVDA)
- What to capture: core business lines (GPU hardware, data center accelerators, AI software stack), end markets (gaming, data center/cloud, automotive, professional visualization), geographic exposure, key customers, and major partners.
- Why it matters: NVDA’s growth thesis hinges on AI compute demand, data center workloads, and the breadth of AI adoption across industries.

2) Basic financials (quarterly, latest reported period)
- Revenue: total revenue by quarter, YoY and QoQ growth; by segment if available (Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Automotive).
- Gross margin: efficiency in product mix and manufacturing; look for any compression due to supply chain or mix shift.
- Operating margin and net margin: expense discipline (R&D, SG&A) relative to revenue.
- Earnings per share (EPS): GAAP and non-GAAP if provided.
- Cash and equivalents: liquidity cushion.
- Key drivers: AI compute demand, supply constraints, pricing power, and product mix shifts.
- Why it matters: Fundamental lead indicators for a high-growth, capital-intensive fabless/semiconductor company. Margin resilience in a rising AI demand environment is a key risk/reward driver.

3) Balance sheet (latest quarterly/annual)
- Assets: cash, marketable securities, receivables, inventories; any significant investments or intangibles.
- Liabilities: current liabilities, long-term debt, other obligations.
- Equity: retained earnings, paid-in capital.
- Liquidity ratios: current ratio, quick ratio; leverage ratios: debt-to-equity, interest coverage.
- Net cash position if applicable.
- Why it matters: NVDA typically carries substantial cash and investments; liquidity and leverage affect financial flexibility, buybacks/dividends potential, and risk profile in downturns.

4) Cash flow (latest quarterly/annual)
- Operating cash flow: cash generation from core operations.
- Free cash flow: cash after capex.
- Investing/capital expenditures: intensity of investments in manufacturing support, capex for data center growth.
- Financing activities: debt issuance/repayment, buybacks, dividends.
- Why it matters: FCF is critical for equity value in growth tech; persistent strong FCF supports buybacks and resilience in downturns.

5) Insider sentiment (past ~15 days)
- What to capture: net sentiment tilt, notable shifts in optimism/pessimism among insiders.
- Why it matters: Short-term insider mood can highlight confidence in near-term performance or potential concerns.

6) Insider transactions (past ~15 days)
- What to capture: notable buys/sells, amounts, positions (CEO, CFO, directors, significant holders).
- Why it matters: large insider purchases can signal conviction; large insider selling without clear rationale can raise questions.

7) Financial history and trends (quarters/years)
- Revenue growth trend, margin trajectory, cash flow trend, and balance sheet strength over the last 4–8 quarters/years.
- Look for: acceleration in AI-related segments, durable gross margins, any material working capital changes, and debt evolution.

8) Risks and catalysts
- Risks: cyclical semiconductor demand, supply chain constraints, pricing competition (AMD/Intel), AI compute demand volatility, geopolitical/regulatory considerations.
- Catalysts: AI model deployment scale, cloud provider spend on NVIDIA GPUs, software ecosystem (CUDA) moat, potential product cycle updates (new architectures).

9) Trading signals from fundamentals (interpretive, not a buy/sell recommendation)
- Positive signals: sustained data center demand, expanding gross margin, strong FCF, disciplined capex, increasing share buybacks with a clear capital allocation plan.
- Cautions: margin compression, inventory build or write-downs, rising competition impacting pricing/market share, macro weakness in enterprise IT spending.
- How to use: align fundamental signals with technicals and market sentiment; use as input for risk management and position sizing rather than a stand-alone signal.

Next steps to get a complete report
- Re-run the data tools when the environment is fixed or provide access to a fresh data feed:
  - Insider sentiment for NVDA (past 15 days)
  - Insider transactions for NVDA (past 15 days)
  - SimFin quarterly balance sheet
  - SimFin quarterly income statement
  - SimFin quarterly cash flow
- Then assemble a filled-out report with actual figures, margins, growth rates, liquidity metrics, and a data-driven table.

If you’d like, I can:
- Retry later and report back with the actual figures from the tools.
- Start from this framework and fill in placeholders with any publicly available 2024–2025 NVDA fundamentals you provide.
- Expand sections (e.g., add a quantitative scoring rubric for each area) once data is available.
