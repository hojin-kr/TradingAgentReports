Analysis summary:
- The proposed plan concludes that NVDA should be held now, pending data-supported confirmation of non-China growth acceleration and a durable uptrend. This aligns with a cautious stance given near-term China/regulatory headwinds, potential margin pressure from competition, and current valuation.
- The long-run AI compute thesis remains intact, but the price today already reflects a strong growth premium. A Hold preserves optionality to participate on a dip or on clearer non-China strength, without overpaying for an uncertain near-term catalyst.

Recommendation:
- Hold NVDA at this time. Maintain a core position but avoid aggressive sizing until a clearer pattern of non-China growth acceleration and confirmatory uptrend signals emerge.

Rationale:
- Near-term risks are material: persistent China/regulatory tailwinds, potential margin compression from competitive dynamics, and the risk that AI capex slows.
- Valuation has already priced in a robust AI cycle; a disciplined Hold reduces downside exposure while retaining upside optionality if conditions improve.
- The plan’s 8-indicator framework suggests waiting for a durable uptrend and non-China growth confirmation before committing more aggressively.

Key triggers to watch (for potential upgrade or downgrade):
- Upgrade to Buy if (a) non-China revenue growth accelerates meaningfully (e.g., consecutive quarterly y/y > 15% with solid margins) and (b) price action confirms a durable uptrend (golden cross, positive MACD, rising volume) with 8-indicator alignment.
- Downgrade to Sell if regulatory headlines intensify with tangible negative impact, or if China demand deteriorates for multiple quarters, or if NVDA breaks meaningful support with waning momentum (e.g., price below ~170 with negative MACD and deteriorating 8-indicator signals).

Risk controls:
- Maintain disciplined position sizing (1–3% portfolio exposure as a baseline, adjustable by existing risk).
- Use stops and trailing stops near key levels; consider hedges if already overweight (puts or collars).
- Reassess at quarterly earnings and whenever major macro/regulatory news breaks; rely on data-driven signals rather than headlines.

Concrete next steps:
- If you already hold NVDA, ensure position size aligns with the plan and set tight risk controls (stop near recent swing low, trailing stop as momentum confirms).
- Monitor non-China growth indicators and 8-indicator signals closely to decide if/when to scale in or out.
