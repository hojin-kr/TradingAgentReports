Thanks for the prompt. I started fetching TSLA data and running the selected indicators, but I ran into a tooling error (FileNotFoundError) when attempting to access the data sources. It looks like an environment issue rather than something specific about TSLA. I can retry, or proceed with a plan and indicator list now and execute once data access is restored.

Proposed indicator set (8 indicators) and why they’re suitable for TSLA
- close_50_sma: 50-day simple moving average. Helps identify the medium-term trend direction and acts as dynamic support/resistance. Useful for confirming the primary trend when TSLA is in a volatile regime.
- close_200_sma: 200-day simple moving average. Long-term trend benchmark. Helps identify major trend regime (bullish/bearish) and potential golden/death cross signals for strategic positioning.
- close_10_ema: 10-day exponential moving average. Captures quicker momentum shifts and potential entry points. Useful in TSLA’s typical high-volatility environment to catch swift moves, but should be filtered with longer-term signals to avoid noise.
- macd: MACD line. Momentum indicator that highlights changes in trend strength and direction via the difference between fast/slow EMAs. Good for spotting trend changes in TSLA when volatility expands.
- macds: MACD Signal. The smoothing of the MACD line. Crossovers between MACD and MACDS can generate trade signals that work best when used with trend context from MAs.
- rsi: RSI. Momentum oscillator used to flag overbought/oversold conditions and potential reversals. In strong TSLA uptrends, RSI can stay elevated longer, so use with trend filters.
- atr: ATR. Measures volatility. Critical for setting risk controls (stops, position sizing) in TSLA’s often wide-range moves, and for adjusting stops as volatility shifts.
- vwma: VWMA. Volume-weighted moving average. Helps validate price movements with volume, distinguishing price moves driven by heavier participation from those on light volume.

What I’ll deliver once data is accessible
- A detailed trend report for TSLA covering:
  - Overall trend context using 50 SMA and 200 SMA (direction, cross signals, support/resistance zones).
  - Short-term momentum and potential entry points using 10 EMA in concert with MACD and MACD Signal.
  - Momentum strength and potential reversals using RSI, plus divergence checks when applicable.
  - Volatility considerations and risk management guidance using ATR.
  - Volume-confirmed trend context using VWMA.
  - A synthesis of signals to outline probable scenarios (bullish, bearish, or range-bound) with associated risk controls and suggested trade ideas.
- A concise, trader-focused interpretation of how these indicators interact in TSLA’s typical behavior, including:
  - Potentially conflicting signals and how to resolve them (e.g., price above 50 SMA but RSI in overbought territory).
  - Market context caveats (news-driven moves, earnings, etc.) that can perturb indicator readings.
- A Markdown table summarizing each indicator, what it signals, and how it complements the others.

Would you like me to retry fetching the data now to produce the full, data-backed report with the 8 indicators? If you approve, I’ll run the data pull again and then deliver the detailed TSLA report as described. If you prefer, I can also proceed with a purely indicator-structure plan (as above) and fill in the readings once data is successfully retrieved.
