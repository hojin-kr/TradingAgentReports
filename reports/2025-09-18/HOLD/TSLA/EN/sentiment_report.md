Sorry about that. I attempted to fetch the latest TSLA Reddit stock posts for 2025-09-18, but the Reddit data tool returned a FileNotFoundError. It looks like a backend path issue on the data service, so I can’t pull the live Reddit sentiment data right now.

How would you like to proceed? Here are a few options, plus I can still deliver a detailed framework and placeholder-ready report in the meantime:

Options to proceed
- Retry now / on a schedule: I can automatically retry fetching Reddit data a few more times and then report back with whatever data (if any) comes through.
- Use alternative sources: I can incorporate sentiment signals from other public sources (e.g., Twitter/X, StockTwits, YouTube comments, major news headlines, earnings chatter) if you’re able to permit me to access them or provide links/files. I can also compile a qualitative analysis based on known catalysts up to the current date.
- Deliver a structured report framework first: I can provide a comprehensive long-form report skeleton (sections, methodology, key questions, and a Markdown table) that you can fill with data once the Reddit feed is available or when you supply sentiment data.
- You provide data: If you have a dataset or pasted excerpts of Reddit posts, I’ll analyze them in depth and deliver the full report with insights and implications for traders.

What I can provide right now (framework and placeholders)
I can give you a complete long-form report structure that you can fill once data is available. It will include:

- Executive snapshot
  - What the current sentiment signals imply for near-term price action
  - Key catalysts and risks for TSLA (production, demand, margins, policy, energy products, AI initiatives)

- Daily sentiment analysis (structure you can populate)
  - Date, sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative), top themes, notable posts/influencers
  - Sentiment delta vs. prior day
  - Brand/feature mentions (Model S/X/Y/3, Cybertruck, Energy, FSD, AI)

- News and catalysts (past week)
  - Headline summaries, sources, potential market impact, and relevance to sentiment

- Thematic analysis
  - Core themes driving sentiment (e.g., demand trends, gross margin pressure, price changes, regulatory scrutiny, product cadence)
  - Contrarian signals to watch (e.g., high skepticism around FSD, supply chain chatter)

- Trader implications and risk framework
  - Short-term trading vibes (volatility drivers, liquidity, options skews)
  - Key risk factors to monitor (policy shifts, production hiccups, competitor actions)
  - Suggested positioning logic (scenarios and catalysts)

- Quantitative indicators to track (optional)
  - Moving-average-based sentiment thresholds
  - Daily sentiment variance and its correlation with intraday moves
  - News sentiment score vs. stock performance

- Final take and recommended stance
  - Probabilistic outlook and decision framework (Buy/Hold/Sell) based on a synthesis of sentiment, news, and fundamentals (with clear caveats)

Markdown table (ready-to-fill template)
- I’ll populate this with real data once available. Here’s a ready-made table you can drop data into:

| Section | Key Points / Signals | Data Source | Time Window | Trader Implications |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Overall Sentiment | e.g., "Net positive with rising FSD chatter" | Reddit, X, StockTwits | Past 7 days | Potential near-term upside; watch for reversal risk |
| Top Themes | e.g., "Price cuts, production ramp, energy products" | Posts, headlines | Past 7 days | Monitor catalysts; adjust exposure if themes shift |
| Notable Posts / Influencers | e.g., "@User" or channel | Reddit/X | Last 48h | High-impact moves if amplification occurs |
| News Headlines | e.g., "Quarterly results," "Regulatory update" | News sources | Past 7 days | Key catalysts; assign sentiment weight |
| Daily Sentiment Scores | +0.15, -0.08, etc. | Reddit + X | Daily | Use for short-term timing cues |
| Risk Flags | Any negative red flags | News + posts | Past 7 days | Position sizing and risk controls |
| Suggested Actions | e.g., "HOLD with hedges," "Watch for breakouts" | Synthesis | N/A | Tactical guidance |

Next steps
- Tell me which path you prefer: retry Reddit data now, switch to an alternative data source, or proceed with the framework/template and you provide data.
- If you want me to retry Reddit data, I can attempt again and report back with a fresh pass as soon as the tool responds.

If you want, I can also start drafting the full long-form report using this framework and placeholders, so you’ll have a ready-to-fill version as soon as the data comes in.
