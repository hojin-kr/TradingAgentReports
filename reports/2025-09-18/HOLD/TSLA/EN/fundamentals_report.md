I attempted to fetch TSLA’s insider sentiment, insider transactions, and the latest quarterly financials, but the tools returned a FileNotFoundError (environment data access issue). This looks like an internal issue rather than missing data. I can try again now, or we can adjust parameters (date range, frequency) if you’d like.

What would you prefer?
- Retry now: I’ll reissue the data pulls (insider sentiment, insider transactions, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement) for TSLA with the same date and quarterly frequency and then compile the full report.
- Change parameters: specify a different curr_date (e.g., a recent date) or switch to annual data instead of quarterly.
- Proceed with a best-effort narrative: I’ll provide a detailed qualitative analysis framework and highlight which metrics to monitor, but without the live data numbers.

If you want me to retry, I’ll proceed and then deliver a comprehensive report that includes:
- Company profile and recent corporate actions
- Most recent quarterly income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow
- Key financial metrics and trends (revenues, margins, EBITDA, net income, cash flow)
- Liquidity/solvency indicators (DSCR, current ratio, debt levels)
- Operational efficiency (ROIC, asset turnover, capex intensity)
- Insider sentiment over the past 15 days
- Insider transactions over the past 15 days
- Interpretation and trading implications for the past week (as of 2025-09-18)
- A Markdown table at the end summarizing key points (metrics, direction, concerns, and potential catalysts)

Optional: tell me any specific metrics you care about (e.g., gross margin, free cash flow, debt-to-equity, ROE, P/E or EV/EBITDA, capex pace, production/sales guidance).
