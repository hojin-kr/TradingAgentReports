Recommendation: Sell (trim exposure) to reduce concentration and valuation risk while hedging and diversifying.

Rationale aligned with the proposed plan
- Concentration and breadth risk: QQQ's performance is heavily linked to a few mega-caps. A material miss from one or two leaders could trigger outsized downside, even if the longer-term AI/cloud thesis remains intact.
- Valuation and regime risk: Elevated multiples in a higher-rate regime leave less cushion for any incremental earnings disappointment or macro wobble.
- Data-readiness caveat: Ongoing data outages or noisy signals reduce confidence in clean buy-the-dip opportunities. Protective hedging and risk controls are prudent.
- Near-term risk management: Hedging and diversification help guard against abrupt regime shifts while you reassess data signals and earnings cadence.

Concrete actions to implement now
1) Trim exposure
- Action: Reduce QQQ exposure by 25%–40% of the current allocation, scaled to your risk tolerance and existing overweight size. If already near neutral, avoid aggressive re-entry and preserve hedged alpha.
2) Hedge protection
- Action: Add a protective hedge on the remaining QQQ exposure.
- Option A (costly but straightforward): Buy 1–2 month at-the-money (ATM) or 5–10% OTM put options on QQQ.
- Option B (cost-efficient): Implement a 1:1 collar (buy OTM puts, sell slightly ITM calls) to finance puts.
3) Rotation into a broader sleeve
- Action: Reallocate a portion of the trimmed capital into broad-market or lower-concentration tech exposure.
- Options: SPY, VTI, or a quality/low-concentration tech ETF to dampen single-name risk.
4) Risk controls and data-readiness
- Action: Apply ATR-based risk controls and explicit stops on the remaining QQQ exposure if any long position remains.
- Rule: Use a trailing stop around 2x ATR or a fixed percentage aligned with your risk budget; maintain dual paths for live data vs. data-outlook narratives.
5) Monitoring cadence
- Action: Track breadth metrics (breadth breadth, dispersion among top-weighted constituents), mega-cap earnings cadence, and macro-rate signals.
- Cadence: Weekly checks during data outages; re-run the eight-indicator framework as data returns to compare with qualitative signals.
6) Contingency plan for re-entry
- Action: If breadth improves and mega-cap earnings show stronger monetization/margin stability, implement a phased re-entry over 4–6 weeks starting with smaller increments and increasing on follow-through signals.

Notes on approach
- This plan emphasizes capital preservation in an uncertain regime, reducing the risk of outsized drawdowns from a few names, while preserving optionality for a later re-acceleration if breadth and earnings momentum improve.

Bottom line
- Given concentration risk, valuation/rate backdrop, and data uncertainties, the recommended path is to Sell (trim) with hedges and a move toward a broader, less concentrated sleeve, plus a disciplined re-entry plan if signals improve.
