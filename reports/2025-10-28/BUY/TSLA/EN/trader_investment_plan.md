I recommend proceeding with Option A: data-backed, numbers-filled version now.

Recommendation
- Action: Buy TSLA with a staged, risk-controlled entry and hedging as outlined in your plan.
- Staged entry (as a structure to implement):
  - Tranche 1: Open core long now, ~40–50% of target core exposure.
  - Tranche 2: Add on a 5–8% pullback within 4–6 weeks if fundamentals (FCF trajectory, energy-storage progress, and AI monetization milestones) remain supportive.
  - Tranche 3: Add on a confirmed breakout or positive catalyst (e.g., strong Q3 2025 results with tangible AI/Optimus monetization progress) to reach full core exposure.
- Tactical sleeve: use defined-risk call spreads or near-dated out-of-the-money calls to participate in upside with limited downside, plus protective puts around earnings to cap downside risk if surprises occur.
- Risk controls:
  - Core stops: 15–20% below average entry on the core position, adjustable as price moves.
  - ATR-based sizing and trailing stops to adapt to regime shifts, especially around earnings and catalysts.
- Catalysts to monitor: Q3 2025 results (gross margins, FCF trajectory, Optimus monetization signals), energy-storage backlog and margins, and any macro/regulatory shifts affecting demand or margins.
- Data backbone (for Option A): I will fetch and synthesize the latest indicators (e.g., 200-day and 50-day moving averages, 10-day EMA, MACD/MACD hist, RSI, ATR, VWMA) and deliver a quantified readout with precise thresholds and price levels to guide each tranche.

Why this makes sense now
- The bull case hinges on durable growth in autos, energy storage, and AI/software monetization; a staged entry with hedges helps capture upside while controlling downside if milestones disappoint.
- The bear case (valuation risk, margins, governance headlines, macro risk) is addressed via disciplined sizing, defined entry points, and risk overlays.

What I’ll deliver next (data-backed version)
- A fully quantified TSLA view with current indicator readings, trigger thresholds for each tranche, price targets for partial profit-taking, and explicit risk metrics (probabilistic downside, VaR-like framing, and hedging costs).

Would you like me to proceed with pulling the latest data and return the numbers-filled version now (Option A), or keep the qualitative plan and fill in the data later (Option B)? 

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
