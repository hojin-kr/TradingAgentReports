Thanks for the prompt. I tried to fetch the TSLA Reddit-based stock news data for 2025-10-28, but the get_reddit_stock_info tool returned a FileNotFoundError (internal backend issue). That means I can’t pull the Reddit feed right now.

What would you like to do next?
- Option 1: I retry the Reddit data fetch now (and I’ll compile the full report once it succeeds).
- Option 2: I proceed with a Reddit-free but still comprehensive TSLA analysis using other public sentiment signals and recent news (I’ll clearly label any data gaps from Reddit and outline how Reddit data would be integrated once the tool is available).

If you’d like to proceed with Option 2 right away, here’s what I can deliver now:
- A trader-focused TSLA sentiment and news framework (without Reddit-specific data), detailing:
  - Daily sentiment confluence from alternative sources (e.g., mainstream social chatter, news headlines) and how those signals typically impact TSLA moves.
  - Key recent news topics to watch (production updates, product cycles, regulatory matters, AI/software, energy storage, margins, guidance).
  - Technical and macro-context overlays to help gauge potential catalysts or headwinds.
  - Potential scenarios and associated trading implications (bullish, bearish, and neutral) with risk considerations.
- A ready-to-fill Markdown table skeleton for the final report, including columns like Date, Source, Sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative), Topic, TSLA Impact, Trader Implications, and Notes.

Proposed Markdown table skeleton (to be filled with actual data once Reddit data is available):
- Date | Source | Sentiment | Topic/Headline | TSLA Impact (Expected Price/Volatility) | Trader Implications | Notes

Please tell me which option you prefer. If you want me to retry now, I’ll run the Reddit data fetch again and proceed with the full, detailed report once it returns.
