Apologies — I tried to fetch the Reddit-based stock sentiment for SPY on 2025-10-28, but the data retrieval tool returned an error (FileNotFoundError). I can retry immediately, or I can proceed with a fallback plan that outlines exactly what I would deliver once the data fetch succeeds. Which would you prefer?

What I can deliver now (plan if you want me to proceed without live Reddit data)
- Because SPY is an ETF (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) that tracks the S&P 500, sentiment tends to reflect broad macro themes, equity risk appetite, and macro news rather than company-specific catalysts. The analysis will focus on:
  - Overall sentiment trend and day-by-day deltas (Positive/Neutral/Negative) across the past week.
  - Top themes and narratives from social media (reddit threads, posts) that mention SPY (e.g., market volatility, macro data, Fed commentary, ETF flows).
  - Recent news headlines and their potential implication for SPY (macro data releases, policy expectations, geopolitical events, earnings cadence for large-cap indices components).
  - Implied expectations from options activity, if available, and how that aligns with sentiment.
  - Risk and trading implications for typical SPY trades (long exposure, hedges, liquidity considerations, and event-driven risks).

- Output format you’ll get:
  - A detailed qualitative synthesis of sentiment and news themes.
  - A day-by-day sentiment framing for the past week with key drivers.
  - Trading implications and scenario-based takeaways (bullish, bearish, neutral) based on the consolidated narrative.
  - A concluding section with actionable ideas and risk checks.

What the final report will include (and you’ll see in the Markdown table at the end)
- Key sentiment signals by date (e.g., SPY sentiment score, dominant mood).
- Dominant narratives driving sentiment (e.g., macro data, Fed expectations, inflation talk, risk-on/off mood).
- Notable news headlines and their potential impact on SPY.
- Trade implications and risk considerations for traders and investors.
- A concise, tabulated summary for quick reference.

Proposed structure of the long-form report
- Executive snapshot: Current sentiment stance and macro backdrop.
- Data & sources: Reddit sentiment (current week), notable news headlines, and any available general market context.
- Day-by-day sentiment analysis: What moved sentiment each day and why (macro data, policy chatter, risk-on/off dynamics).
- Thematic synthesis: Top recurring themes and how they interact with SPY’s behavior.
- News impact assessment: How recent headlines could influence SPY price action and volatility.
- Trading implications: Scenarios, hedging ideas, and risk controls tailored to SPY.
- Limitations & next steps: Data limitations and what would be added once data retrieval succeeds.

If you want me to retry fetching the Reddit data immediately, say “Retry now,” and I’ll attempt the data pull again and return the full report with live sentiment and news integration. If you’d prefer to proceed with the fallback plan right away, I can deliver the full qualitative framework and structure (as described) without the live Reddit data for now.
