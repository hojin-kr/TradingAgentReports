I hit an internal error fetching the NVDA Reddit data for 2025-10-28 (FileNotFoundError). It seems the data source for that tool is temporarily unavailable.

What I can do next:
- I can retry fetching the Reddit stock info for NVDA now, in case the issue is transient.
- If the tool remains unavailable, I can proceed with a best-effort synthesis using alternative public signals (other social platforms and general news) and clearly mark where data is missing from the Reddit feed.
- Once data is retrieved (or if you approve using alternative sources), I will produce a comprehensive long report with detailed sentiment analysis, daily breakdown, and a trader-focused interpretation, plus a final Makrdown table of key points.

Here is the plan I will follow once data is available or when you confirm to proceed with alternatives:
- Data collection
  - Social sentiment: daily sentiment scores and post volumes for NVDA over the past 7 days, focused on Reddit, with emphasis on r/NVIDIA, r/investing, and related subreddits; cross-check with other platforms if possible.
  - News and catalysts: summarize the most relevant NVDA headlines from the past week (product launches, earnings, guidance changes, supply chain, regulatory, AI demand signals).
- Sentiment analysis
  - Identify the dominant themes driving sentiment (AI demand, supply chain, valuation concerns, competition, potential product announcements).
  - Track sentiment trend: overall feel (bullish, neutral, bearish) by day, and note any gaps or anomalies (e.g., a spike in negative sentiment around a specific news item).
  - Highlight key quotes or anecdotes that illustrate the mood.
- Contextual analysis
  - Map sentiment to recent news events, earnings guidance, or product cycle context (e.g., AI accelerator demand, data center capex, GPU supply dynamics).
  - Compare NVDA’s momentum against peers/cohorts (e.g., AMD, INTC, TSM, AMD competitors) if data allows.
- Implications for traders
  - Short-term catalysts and risks (e.g., potential AI demand deceleration, supplier constraints, macro headwinds).
  - Sentiment strength vs. price action: does sentiment align with or diverge from recent moves?
  - Price action cues to watch (breakouts, pullbacks, volume spikes) in relation to sentiment shifts.
- Actionable takeaways
  - Potential scenarios (bullish, neutral, bearish) with probability-driven implications.
  - Risk management notes and indicators to watch (volatility, option skew, implied volatility changes around key events).
- Final deliverable
  - A polished long report with a structured Makrdown table at the end to organize key points, trends, catalysts, and risks.

If you’d like me to proceed right now, please choose:
- Retry the Reddit data fetch for NVDA on 2025-10-28 (I’ll attempt again immediately).
- Or proceed with an alternative plan using other sources while we wait for Reddit data to come back.

Also, feel free to specify any particular angles you want emphasized (e.g., focus more on AI data-center demand signals, or on GPU pricing/production news).
