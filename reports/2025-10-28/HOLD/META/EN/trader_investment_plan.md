Short answer: Hold META.

Rationale
- The proposed plan captures a credible long-run AI-driven upside but rightly flags near-term execution risk, regulatory headwinds, and ad-market sensitivity. Given elevated expectations priced into the stock, a cautious stance preserves optionality while you monitor for tangible progress.
- Key near-term risks include ROI timing on AI monetization, data-center/cost dynamics, and regulatory developments that could dampen monetization velocity. On the upside, durable AI-enabled monetization and margin leverage could unlock meaningful upside if progress proves durable.

Decision framework and actionable triggers
- Base case (Hold justified): Modest AI-driven topline uplift with gradual margin improvement; stock drifts sideways to modestly higher as earnings visibility improves but without clear, repeatable monetization milestones.
- Upgrade trigger (Move to Buy): Clear, verifiable ARPU/RPM uplift from AI features across multiple ad formats and non-ad products, accompanied by sustained margin expansion due to data-center efficiency and controllable costs, with no material regulatory headwinds changing the cost outlook.
- Downgrade trigger (Move to Sell): AI monetization stalls or reverses, ad demand weakens, or margin trajectory deteriorates due to rising costs or regulatory actions; any material negative regulatory development that meaningfully constrains data flows or increases compliance costs.

Positioning guidance
- If you’re already long: continue with disciplined risk management (e.g., ATR-based stops, consider hedges such as collars to protect downside while preserving upside if AI milestones are hit).
- If you’re not yet long: consider a cautious, small starter only on affirmative AI monetization signals; avoid large capacity until milestones are clearly met.

Operational discipline
- Monitor quarterly AI monetization metrics (ARPU/RPM lift, advertiser ROI improvements), margin trajectory linked to AI workloads, and regulatory developments that could affect costs or monetization velocity.
- Reassess after the next earnings cycle with a data-driven read on monetization progress and cost structure.

Conclusion
- Given the current evidence, the prudent stance remains Hold, with explicit, clearly defined triggers to upgrade to Buy or trim to Sell based on AI monetization milestones and regulatory outcomes. Maintain hedges or risk controls to shield against near-term earnings surprises or macro/regulatory shocks.
