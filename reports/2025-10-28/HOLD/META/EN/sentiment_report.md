The Reddit stock-info fetch is currently failing with a FileNotFoundError. I can’t pull the latest Reddit-based sentiment data for META right now. I can proceed in one of these ways—please tell me which you prefer:

Options
1) Retry Reddit data fetch now (or on a short delay) and then produce the full report with the latest Reddit sentiment data included.
2) Use alternative data sources you approve (e.g., other social platforms, StockTwits, Twitter/X sentiment, public news articles, earnings calls, regulatory updates) and deliver a comprehensive long report with those sources.
3) Proceed with a provisional, data-limited analysis using publicly known information up to 2025-10-28 (clearly labeled as provisional and not relying on the Reddit feed), and generate a detailed analytical report with a markdown table at the end.

What I can deliver in any path
- A comprehensive, trader-focused analysis of META (Meta Platforms, Inc.) over the past week, combining sentiment signals, news flow, and potential implications for traders.
- Identification of themes driving sentiment (e.g., AI initiatives, ad revenue trends, product launches, regulatory/regulatory-privacy issues, competitive landscape, platform changes).
- Day-by-day sentiment trends (if available from sources you approve) and key news catalysts that moved sentiment.
- A practical implications section with actionable takeaways for traders (risk factors, potential volatility drivers, entry/exit considerations, and hedging ideas).
- A final Markdown-formatted table organizing key points (sections, data sources, catalysts, sentiment tone, and trader implications).

If you’d like me to proceed immediately, please choose one:
- Retry Reddit data (option 1)
- Use alternative sources (option 2)
- Provisional analysis (option 3)

I can start on option 3 right away if you want a quick turnaround, or wait for option 1/2 to feed in the Reddit-derived sentiment.
