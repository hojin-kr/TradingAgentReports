Thanks for the update. I’m hitting a tool error on the Reddit stock info fetch for NFLX (FileNotFoundError). I’ll retry shortly if you’d like, but in the meantime here’s a productive path forward and a solid framework for the NFLX social sentiment and news report you asked for. This will help us move quickly once the data fetch works again.

What I can do now (without fresh Reddit data)
- Provide a robust methodology and structure for a long-form report you can use to guide the final output once the Reddit/news data is available.
- Outline the key sentiment analytics you’ll want to track daily over the past week, plus the types of news items that typically move NFLX sentiment (content slate, subscription metrics, price action, regulatory/deals, competition).

Proposed plan for the NFLX social sentiment and news report
1) Executive summary
- Snapshot of overall sentiment over the past 7–10 days and how it aligns with any notable price moves or catalyst announcements.
- Quick read on whether social chatter is tipping risks or signaling buying interest.

2) Data sources and methodology
- Primary sources: Reddit posts/comments (r/investing, r/stocks, r/Netflix, r/WallStreetBets or equivalents), other finance-focused subreddits if available.
- Sentiment scoring approach: normalized daily sentiment index (positive/neutral/negative), post volume, engagement signals (upvotes, comments), topic modeling (content slate, price targets, churn, ARPU, ad-supported tier, password-sharing crackdown, platform performance).
- News signal curation: major company announcements, earnings, content releases, partnerships, subscriber metrics, price targets from analysts, regulatory/regulatory risk.
- Time window: rolling 7-day window with daily granularity.

3) Daily sentiment breakdown (past week)
- Day-by-day sentiment trend (positive vs negative vs neutral).
- Daily post volume and engagement trends.
- Top themes driving sentiment each day (e.g., content slate excitement/dissatisfaction, subscriber growth concerns, price actions, new features like ads, etc.).
- Notable sentiment outliers and potential catalysts behind them.

4) News digest and impact assessment
- Categorize latest NFLX news into: earnings/financials, product/content roadmap, subscriber guidance, pricing/tiers, platform changes, regulatory/compliance, competitive dynamics (Disney+, Prime Video, etc.), macro factors.
- For each item: summarize, source credibility, immediate market reaction (if applicable), sentiment tilt, and potential longer-term impact on users/investors.

5) Sentiment drivers and risk/themes to watch
- Content slate strength and reaction to major releases (seasonalality, tentpole shows, unique IP).
- Subscriber growth/ARPU trajectory vs expectations.
- Competitive landscape shifts and platform ecosystem (bundling, ads, mobile/streaming quality).
- Pricing strategy moves (ad-supported tier expansion, price hikes) and consumer response.
- Macroeconomic/tech sector risk factors that commonly influence streaming stocks.

6) Trader-focused insights
- Potential support/resistance cues from social sentiment and news cadence.
- When sentiment spikes align with price moves, potential timing opportunities for trades (names, not financial advice).
- Risk flags: sustained negative sentiment with weak news catalysts; overhang from macro/tech growth concerns.
- Options flow signals to monitor (if available, e.g., put/call skew near key levels, unusual activity around earnings or content launches).

7) caveats and limitations
- Reddit-based sentiment has noise; it should be triangulated with price action, earnings, and other sentiment sources.
- News coverage quality and sentiment can be skewed by celebrity posts, meme sentiment, or short-term events.

8) Deliverables and data table (ready to fill)
- A final report with a narrative section plus an appended Markdown table summarizing key points, drivers, and potential implications.

Proposed Markdown table skeleton (to populate once data is available)
- This template is designed to be filled with daily inputs and extracted insights.

| Date | Net Sentiment (Positive - Negative) | Post Volume | Top Themes | News Catalyst Today | Price/Market Context | Potential Trading Implication | Confidence | Notes |
|------|-------------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | +X / -Y | N posts | Theme A, Theme B | Catalyst description | Price action context | Short/Medium-term implication | High/Med/Low | Any caveats |

Next steps
- I will re-attempt the Reddit data fetch for NFLX with the current date (2025-10-28) as soon as the tool is back online. If you’d like, I can also try a parallel attempt with a slightly different date window (e.g., 2025-10-21 to 2025-10-28) to ensure we get a usable weekly signal.
- If the tool remains unavailable, I can proceed with the plan using a structured framework and request permission to temporarily augment with any publicly available summaries or other data you provide.

Please let me know:
- Do you want me to retry the Reddit data fetch right away?
- If you’re open to it, I can also proceed with the report framework now and drop in data as soon as the tool works, keeping the Markdown table structure ready for final compilation.

I’ll stay ready to run the fetch as soon as the tool is functioning again.
