Recommendation: Hold AMD right now.

Rationale
- Near-term catalysts are multi-quarter and dependent on macro/government timing, ROCm ecosystem uptake, and margin progression from rack-scale services. While the long-term AI infrastructure thesis remains intact, the catalysts required to lift the stock meaningfully in the near term are not yet clear.
- Competitive backdrop: Nvidia’s dominance and potential pricing pressure add downside risk to near-term margins if ROCm monetization lags or enterprise pricing pressures intensify.
- Strategic pivot (manufacturing divestiture and services focus) can create longer-term benefits, but earnings visibility and margin expansion from software/services are still evolving and may take more time to materialize than the market currently prices in.
- The plan’s logic to upgrade to Buy only after verifiable progress remains prudent: multi-machine DoE deployments, meaningful ROCm adoption metrics translating into recurring revenue, and sustainable gross-margin improvement from rack-scale solutions.

What would trigger an upgrade to Buy (actionable milestones)
- DoE Lux/Discovery deployments: concrete hardware installations and customer announcements signaling multi-machine deployments starting 2025–2026.
- ROCm monetization progress: measurable adoption metrics (certified workloads, growing ROCm-enabled customer base) with revenue contribution from software/services.
- Margin expansion: sustained gross-margin uplift driven by rack-scale/system sales and higher services contribution, not just cost cutting.
- Technical confirmation: bullish price action with momentum indicators (e.g., return above a meaningful moving average plus positive MACD and supportive RSI) to accompany fundamental progress.

Positioning guidance (if you decide to upsize to Buy)
- If/when upgrade triggers occur, implement in stages:
  - Stage 1: 25% of the intended Buy position upon the first confirmed milestone.
  - Stage 2: 50% upon a second corroborating milestone or sustained quarterly progress.
  - Stage 3: Remaining 25% on continued, durable progress over multiple quarters.
- Maintain risk controls: ATR-based stops around earnings and milestone news; limit exposure with position sizing aligned to your portfolio risk budget; consider hedges or collar strategies to manage downside.

Watchlist and monitoring
- DoE milestone updates and partner activity (HPE, Oracle) and any public deployment announcements.
- ROCm ecosystem milestones: new certified workloads, developer ecosystems, and any monetization signals.
- Margin trajectory: track gross margin, services mix, and contribution from rack-scale/system sales.
- Price-action context: monitor 50/200-day moving averages, MACD, RSI to confirm a sustainable uptrend before pursuing Buy.

Lessons integrated
- Avoid relying on a single catalyst; require corroborating signals across government deployments, enterprise/partner momentum, and evident monetization in software/services.
- Maintain explicit risk controls and exit paths; don’t over-allocate based on hype.
- Diversify exposure within the AI infrastructure space to balance name-specific risk while preserving upside potential.

Bottom line
- Hold AMD today. Upgrade to Buy only after clear, durable progress across DoE milestones, ROCm adoption, and margin improvement from rack-scale solutions and services. Until then, preserve exposure with disciplined risk management and staged entry once verifiable catalysts are in place.
