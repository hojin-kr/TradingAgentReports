# Investment Report: AMD
## Executive Summary
AMD’s long-term AI-infrastructure story remains intact, but near-term gains depend on several milestones. Hold now; upgrade to Buy only after confirmed multi-quarter progress in DoE Lux/Discovery milestones, ROCm monetization, and rack-scale margin gains.

## Investment Decision
Recommendation: Hold. Confidence level: Moderate. Near-term upside hinges on multiple milestones that are not guaranteed to land quickly.

## Key Reasons Supporting This Decision
- Near-term catalysts exist but are staged. DoE Lux/Discovery milestones, ROCm adoption, and rack-scale margin improvements are real, but they unfold over several quarters rather than in one event.
- Long-run AI-infrastructure thesis is compelling, but near-term upside is limited by Nvidia’s lead, macro risks, and possible lumpiness in government-driven programs.
- A disciplined, milestone-based path to Buy makes sense: upgrade only after corroborated progress across multiple signals (DoE milestones, ROCm monetization, and margin lift).

## Risks To Watch
- Milestones can be uneven and uncertain; government and hyperscaler spending cycles may slow.
- Nvidia dominance and pricing pressure could limit AMD’s near-term gains if ROCm adoption lags.
- Margin durability depends on software/services uptake; weaker ROCm monetization or slower rack-scale adoption could weaken margins.
- Macro and policy shifts affecting government programs could delay or reduce upside.
