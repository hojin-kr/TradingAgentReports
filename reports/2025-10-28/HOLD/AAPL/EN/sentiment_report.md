I attempted to fetch Reddit sentiment data for AAPL for 2025-10-22 through 2025-10-28, but the tool returned a FileNotFoundError for all attempts, including the single-date request for 2025-10-28. Because of this tool issue, I don’t yet have the day-by-day Reddit sentiment to analyze. I can proceed in a couple of ways and can switch to other data sources if you’d like:

 Options
- Wait and retry the Reddit data fetch once the tool issue is resolved (preferred if you specifically want Reddit-driven sentiment).
- Use alternative public sentiment signals (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits, YouTube comment sentiment) and complement with public news coverage to build the weekly view.
- Focus on traditional sentiment signals around Apple’s recent news, earnings, product cycles, or regulatory developments if you want a fast turnaround.

Given the current constraint, here’s a comprehensive plan for the long-form report you asked for, plus a structured framework and a placeholder table you can fill in once the data path is restored.

What I will deliver (once data access is restored)
- A week-by-week sentiment analyst report for AAPL, focusing on social media chatter (Reddit as primary), plus corroborating signals from other social channels and mainstream news.
- A synthesis of recent company news and its potential impact on sentiment and price action.
- A trader-oriented set of insights outlining potential catalysts, risk factors, and practical trade ideas (short-term and medium-term) grounded in sentiment and news.
- A clear, readable Markdown table at the end summarizing key takeaways.

Draft structure of the long-form report (ready to populate with data)
1) Executive Summary
- Core takeaway: current sentiment tone (overall positive/neutral/negative) and how it aligns with recent price action and notable news.
- Quick read on risk and opportunity for traders over the next trading window.

2) Data and Methodology
- Data sources: Reddit (primary for this report), with cross-checks against X/Twitter, StockTwits, YouTube comments, and major Apple news outlets.
- Time window: 2025-10-22 to 2025-10-28 (or last 7 days from the current date).
- Sentiment scoring approach: how positive/negative/neutral signals are defined, and how volume is interpreted.

3) Day-by-Day Sentiment and Themes (high-granularity)
- For each date, summarize:
  - Net sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
  - Top topics or recurring themes (e.g., product rumors, supply chain, services growth, regulatory aspects)
  - Notable posts or threads driving sentiment (without reproducing disallowed content)
  - Any notable correlation with price moves or volatility
- Cross-date synthesis to identify theme shifts (e.g., shift from product anticipation to earnings commentary).

4) News and Contextual Drivers
- Summary of recent company news, press releases, earnings calls, regulatory updates, and macro events that could influence sentiment.
- Assessment of whether sentiment movements align with, contradict, or anticipate news events.

5) Sentiment vs Price Action: Implications for Traders
- Correlation observations: sentiment vs. daily/weekly price changes and volume.
- Potential mispricings or sentiment-driven opportunities (e.g., overextended positive sentiment ahead of a potential catalyst; or negative sentiment with a constructive underlying business signal).
- Implied volatility considerations around notable events (product announcements, earnings, regulatory decisions).

6) Risk Flags and Guardrails
- Key downside risks tied to sentiment signals (e.g., sentiment overheating, meme-driven moves, or sentiment decays if news fails to materialize).
- Liquidity and execution considerations for different time horizons.

7) Trade Ideas and Scenarios
- If sentiment remains positive: strategic/neutral-to-long tilt, with hedging considerations.
- If sentiment softens: risk-managed approaches (stop levels, options-based hedges, or reducing exposure).
- Event-driven ideas surrounding upcoming catalysts (earnings, product cycles, regulatory items).
- Suggested instruments across time horizons (stocks, options, spreads) with rationale.

8) Conclusions and Takeaways
- Summarize the current state, likely near-term trajectory, and the most robust signals for traders.

9) Appendices (as needed)
- Detailed day-by-day notes, methodology technicals, and data quality checks.

What I can do next (two paths)
- Path A (fast): Retry the Reddit data fetch as soon as the tool is available again, then populate the report with day-by-day sentiment, themes, and news alignment.
- Path B (alternative now): Start compiling the report using other sentiment signals and public Apple news coverage while we wait for Reddit data. I can deliver a near-term draft focused on:
  - General sentiment trends from alternative sources
  - The latest non-Reddit news affecting AAPL
  - Initial trading implications based on that data
  - A filled-in version of the table with the data you’re comfortable including

Please tell me which path you prefer. If you want to proceed immediately, I can assemble a near-term draft (Path B) using non-Reddit sources and clearly mark where Reddit sentiment will be inserted once the tool is back online. If you’d rather wait, I’ll re-run the Reddit fetch as soon as the tool is functioning and deliver a fully populated, Reddit-centric report.
